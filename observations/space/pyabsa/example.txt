Text: Pulled the <blankets:Neutral> back on the bed was surprised to see there was a duvet that nobody uses because you know they don ' t wash them , the middle blanket was all ripped ( on both beds ) , the <sheets:Negative> looked like they needed washed , anytime you move at all the bed continues to bounce for a while after .
Text: We booked a <regular king room:Neutral> for 5 nites and left after the 2d nite .
Text: The hotel is overall alright and the <theme rooms:Neutral> or suites may be roomier but the <regular rooms:Negative> are very cramped .

Text: you could barely sqeeze between the foot of the bed and the armoir .

Text: The hotel had some nice <decor:Positive> and was probably v ery nice when it was newer , but needs to be updated and new <carpet:Negative> .
Text: The <breakfast:Positive> was very good and there was lots of room for every \ one to sit and eat .
Text: they had some pretty good <entertainment:Positive> each morning for <breakfast:Neutral> .

Text: We just wanted more room and a bed with a pillow top <mattress:Neutral> .
Text: We won ' t stay here again unless they offer the <theme rooms:Neutral> and suites at a fair <price:Positive> .
Text: The <Settle Inn:Neutral> has three separate buildings and we were given a <room:Neutral> in the oldest of the three .
Text: The hotel needs updating and cleaning .

Text: You could barely walk between the armoire and the bed .
Text: The <bathroom:Negative> was extremely small , with an older <bath / shower:Negative> and <toilet:Neutral> .
Text: The room smelled musty .

Text: The <continental breakfast:Neutral> is <served:Negative> only in the first of the three buildings , which meant walking a distance .
Text: We found this delightful hotel called The Stone Castle ( formerly known as Settle Inn ) .
Text: It ' s right off the main drag and strikingly nestled into the Ozark hillside .
Text: It ' s a lovely <facility:Positive> that gives off a castle - like feeling , complete with medieval knight right there at the entrance to greet you .
Text: The <room:Positive> was quite comfortable and affordable .
Text: Our package included <Belgian waffles:Neutral> and <biscuits:Neutral> and <gravy:Neutral> the next morning with a breathtaking <view:Positive> out the <widespread windows:Positive> in the dining <room:Neutral> of the Ozark mountains on a crisp sunny morning .
Text: This <place:Positive> was just great - perfect for smaller kids .
Text: The Stone Castle will surely be our hotel of choice every time we visit Branson .
Text: Glad I found it ! !
Text: Then she discovers that they made a mistake and reserved one <room:Negative> for the 26 - 30 .
Text: At this stage they said they only had another room with a single queen available and it was in a different building than the other room .
Text: I had to cancel the <rooms:Neutral> and then frantically search for another Hotel with an <indoor pool:Neutral> in Branson on a Friday night .
Text: It was a complete nightmare after a long drive .
Text: Thank goodness we found The Cascade Motel and they had a family suite for us and a far Superior place to stay for about the same <price:Neutral> .
Text: Our <room:Negative> was fine except a little dark .
Text: The <room:Positive> was nice and clean and for the <price:Positive> it was better than expected for us .
Text: The <staff:Positive> was great but the <breakfast:Negative> was not so great but is was good enough .
Text: <Swimming area:Positive> was clean and fun and everything you want to see is near this hotel .
Text: Hotel had a great <breakfast:Positive> .
Text: The <jets:Negative> on the <hot tub:Neutral> were broken and sprayed water in your face if you tried to use them , one pool was ice cold while the other was fine .
Text: The Settle Inn Branson was an excellent choice .
Text: We have stayed at this location on two other occassions and plan to return in the next time we go to Branson .
Text: 2d time to stay at this hotel .
Text: 2 , count ' em 2 , separate indoor pools and hot tubs !
Text: No worry about pools full of kids .
Text: <Rooms:Neutral> are fine , nothing fancy .
Text: Beds could be softer .
Text: The hotel is nice from the exterior .
Text: Typical Branson - if you ' re expecting an W Hotel , Vegas - esq spread , or even a nice Marriott Renaissance - you might keep looking .
Text: However , it ' s neat and tidy .
Text: It ' s a bit dated , but clean .
Text: The <owners:Negative> are in the process of updating rooms , so I think this is a known issue .
Text: However , the <room:Positive> was very acceptable , as were the <common area:Positive> and the pools .
Text: <Breakfast:Positive> was good and the usual hot <items:Positive> .
Text: The first thing I noticed is the <hallways:Negative> were very dark even in daytime .
Text: My room was very small , again very poor lighting .
Text: The <bathroom door:Negative> hits the toilet when you close it .
Text: The hotel said no other <rooms:Neutral> were available to switch and a locksmith was not available to fix the locks .
Text: Cold <breakfast:Negative> !
Text: the hotel was very artistic , the workmanship of the building was just beautiful , i think it was the largest hotel in Branson .
Text: wonderful in door pool and hot tub / spa .
Text: great complimentary <breakfast:Positive> .
Text: our lodging experience at the settle inn was just great , i would recommend this hotel to everyone .
Text: Pluses : Good <service:Positive> , inexpensive , friendly , everything works , nice <bath fixtures:Positive> Negatives : the <continental breakfast:Negative> is kind of sad , but the <hot breakfast:Negative> isn ' t any better .
Text: The <hotel:Positive> was very pleasant .
Text: The <beds:Positive> were comfortable and a good <size:Positive> .
Text: Stayed 2 nights , <room:Negative> was very small and was damp and musty .
Text: The room was like being in a cave with a bad <smell:Negative> .
Text: We stayed at this place for 5 awful nights for a conference .
Text: Free breakfast ; that ' s using the term breakfast loosely .
Text: The <rooms:Negative> were dirty , small and the <t . v:Negative> .
Text: was tiny , though housed in a large armoire .
Text: One good thing about the place was the <bed:Positive> .
Text: It is the hotel we always stay at .
Text: There are a couple of nice restaurants or fast food joints very near , along with a couple of mini - golf courses .
Text: The rooms are always very clean and have a <coffee pot:Neutral> , blow dryer , and cable tv .
Text: There are a couple of swimming pools and hot tubs available that are open early in the morning to very late at night .
Text: In the morning you can enjoy a free <breakfast:Positive> with many <choices:Positive> .
Text: It is no wonder The Stone Castle is the only place I want to stay when I am in Branson !
Text: The <room:Positive> was beautiful and the <<beds:Positive>:Positive> were some of the most comfortable beds I had ever slept in .
Text: My teenage boy and girl were with us and really enjoyed the <pools:Positive> and the <hot tubs:Positive> .
Text: I give this Hotel the highest available .
Text: We also got a reduced <rate:Positive> through another booking event , but I was already intrigued with the idea of the themed <rooms:Neutral> .
Text: We stayed in the one with the stone arch and all the knight themes .
Text: Yes , it was an older hotel and room , and it did have a slight musty smell , but the charm overwhelmed everything .
Text: There were all sorts of artifacts in the room from helmets to weapons and the <waterfall jacuzzi:Positive> was the most spectacular and ingenious piece .
Text: It was a comfortable <room:Positive> but was not very clean .
Text: Very dark rooms and could hear every sound from the room next to us .
Text: <Breakfast:Positive> was ok but poorly stocked , there were only ~ 10 <rooms:Neutral> rented while we were there so no excuse for overcrowded .
Text: This is just an older hotel that they have tried to fixed up but too many tale tale signs of aging .
Text: We stayed in one of the regular <<rooms:Neutral>:Neutral> and toured the themed rooms ( $ 50 . 00 ) more a night , I ' m glad we did not pay extra for a room that was the same as ours except for murals on the walls and an old <whirlpool tub:Negative> , would never recommend a themed room .
Text: If you get the <room:Positive> free like we did I guess it would be worth it , I ' m glad we did not pay for it ( time share presentation ) .
Text: My wife and I stayed at The Stone Castle Hotel & Conference Center in Branson , MO from Wednesday thru Sunday and had a very good <time:Positive> .
Text: The <breakfast:Positive> in the mornings was very good .
Text: They also have <family suites:Positive> that are great .
Text: This is a sprawling <place:Negative> but it is beginning to show its age .
Text: The room was clean but worn the <AC / Heat:Negative> was very noisy and the towels really needed to be replaced .
Text: Stone Castle is very convenient to the main strip in Branson , but is also accessible to the relief routes that avoid traffic The <rooms:Positive> were very clean and the <beds:Positive> were super comfortable .
Text: The free <breakfast buffet:Positive> in the morning was delicious and had a good <variety:Positive> .
Text: I highly doubt there is a better room for the price in Branson !
Text: at the stone castle hotel it is highly a must to see and stay at , from its three castles and two indoor heated pools and two spas it also is equipt with a family arcade , gift shop , laundry and a hot deliciuos <breakfast:Positive> each morning and if thats not enough it also has for your convience high speed <internet:Positive> and a computer for your use in the lobby . the rooms are newly remolded with pillow top beds , table and chairs , restroom etc needs , ironing board and iron , and a blow dryer . the tvs are meduim size and cable tv . this hotel is right smack in the heart of branson .

Text: The <bathrooms:Negative> were so small you had to stand behind the door to close it .

Text: The <rooms:Negative> seem small , tight fit for a family of 4 .
Text: The pools were very cloudy , could not see the bottom of the pool ( which is not deep ) .

Text: It ' s in a very quiet part of Branson , the <rooms:Positive> are super clean , the <staff:Positive> is very helpful and they have a great <hot breakfast:Positive> .

Text: Most of the <events:Positive> , <exhibits:Neutral> , <shows:Positive> , and <restaurants:Neutral> were just a short ride from the hotel .
Text: Out of 7 <<pillows:Negative>:Negative> all but one was stained and even Josh the young man who brought us the pillows and sheet said he would let the GM know about the status of these nasty pillows !
Text: Well <room:Negative> 506 was not clean and the hallway stunk and as we entered into the room the floor was wet from the sink leaking .
Text: One of the <pillows:Negative> I checked just before my 8 year old daughter was about to put her head down on it and it appeared to be molded .
Text: This hotel was very comfortable , with a full <buffet breakfast:Positive> .
Text: Other reviews state that the <rooms:Negative> are small , but I found they were just a little more narrow than other properties .
Text: The <room:Negative> smelled musty when we first walked in .
Text: We asked for another room .
Text: Hotel needs updating .
Text: Rooms are dark and dingy ( black carpet ? )
Text: You literally had to turn around to get into the <bathroom:Negative> .
Text: We wanted to upgrade to a larger room , but only standard rooms are pet friendly .
Text: With all the choices in Branson , we would not stay here again .
Text: We have stayed at the Stone Castle Hotel twice now and have been very pleased both times .
Text: The <rooms:Positive> are nice and the <location:Positive> is close enough to access everything we want to do in Branson , but off the strip so we can get to it quickly .
Text: The pool and hot tub are open until 1 am which worked great for us when we got in late .
Text: The kids love the big <breakfast:Positive> with <eggs:Neutral> , waffles , b & g , <donuts:Positive> , etc .
Text: and we were lucky enough to see a <breakfast show:Positive> during one of our stays .
Text: When my wife and I were trying to find a hotel to stay in for a weekend family vacation , we came across this hotel .

Text: Very warm , cozy , and comfortable <rooms:Positive> .

Text: One <room:Positive> was very warm .
Text: Unfortunately , my husband and I were stuck in the warmer <room:Negative> .

Text: At first when I saw this big , magnificent hoteI that looked like a castle I thought that it would be way too much to stay there .
Text: My Son was very young at the time and wanted to stay there as he liked knights and horses and they have statues of them at the entrance and inside the building , We decided to humor ourselves and stop by and see how much a room would be and we found that it was quite affordable and had many extras to offer .
