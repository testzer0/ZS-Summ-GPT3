# Log-IDF computed where the IDF set consists of all statements of all summaries.
# Then the average of Log-IDF is computed (i.e. TF-IDF) for each sentence
# This is further averaged per-system.

# Specifically, IDF = log(N/(1+df))
# If a word occurs very few times in other documents, this score will be high
# I.e. low score = high repetitiveness
