1) Some method to find thresholds for positive and negative scores.
    a) Finding the knee point might be good.
    b) Use this to find number of supporting and weakening statements for each line.
2) Metric must have two components -
    a) The "correctness" of the proposition purely based on number of supporting and
        weakening statements.
    b) When people's statements are split around even, (a) will give around 50% for the best
        model, so another component must check whether (i) the reviewer opinions are "about
        even" and (ii) The summary has another line which says the exact opposite of this one.
        For example, if one of the statements (say, after simplification) is 
        "The beds were comfortable"
        and user reviews are 50/50 on the comfort of beds, then (i) should give 50%. If there is 
        another line in the summary that is opposed to this one, then *this sentence's score* must be
        increased by around 50%.
3) "Continuous" metric.
    a) Use knee point to get p positive and n negative statements w.r.t line.
    b) metric1 = p/(p+n)
    c) v = -max(0,*other_statement_scores_wrt_this_one) 
        => gives the extent of having opposite
        statements in this summary w.r.t this one.
        Can replace max with a softmax weighted avg if more smoothness is required.
    d) For metric2, we need a measure of how much the metrics were "about even". Note that
        18/23 should also be about even along with e.g. 2/2 or something. As the numbers get
        bigger, their difference should matter less and less; thus this metric should depend
        on how close f(p) and f(n) are, where f could be sqrt. (Using f(x)=x may also work)
       x = (f(p)-f(n))/(f(p)+f(n))
       metric2 = (exp(-f*x^2)-e^(-f))/(1-e^(-f)) 
       (see metric.png)
    e) metric-final = (1-k)*metric1 + k*metric2
        How to choose f,k?
        k must depend on v somehow. One could try k=v/2.
