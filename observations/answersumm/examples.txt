Title: Why does the bitzen in my elevator have a '?' on it?
Question: Usually when a Bitzen is in the elevator, it has an exclamation mark notification with a floor they want to be dropped off on.   But I have noticed some of them joining with a '?' and then they tell you which floor they want to be dropped off on  after  you click on the elevator.    Why the question mark notification?
---- Answers ----
1. The question mark characters are special characters. Each character "belongs" to a specific floor that matches some part of the story. If the character is delivered to the proper floor, you will unlock a cutscene for that floor. A prime example is delivering the sticky buns Leia to the interrogation floor. A question mark is in place of the bubble so that you do not know which floor they are going to, since you could just move their special floor to the floor they are going to unlock the scene. You have to get lucky with the character and floor they are going to. Any question mark character can be delivered to any imperial floor, regardless of the number floor they are supposed to go to.
2. Unlocked special characters (Princess Leia, Boba Fett, etc.) are always question marks. From what I can tell, it means they'll never go to a residential floor with an open spot, since they can't move in. There are also regular bitizens with a question mark, but I don't know if the same applies to them.
3. I've noticed that "?" citizens double the tip when you drop them off at their requested level For example, a regular citizen shows up to your elevator and requests level 10. You take them to level 10 and then you get a 10 coin tip. If it was a citizen with a question mark who requested level 10 after the elevator moved, then you will get a 20 coin tip. If you have any elevator upgrades, the multiplier (x2) of question mark citizens will apply after the elevator's {doubling, tripling, quadrupling, quintupling} is applied. For example, lets say I have the x3 elevator upgrade. A regular citizen asks to go to level 10. When I drop him off at his requested level he will leave me with a 30 coin tip. If it is a question mark citizen that requests to go to level 10 after I move the elevator, they will leave me with a 60 coin tip on arrival (10 x3(elevator multiplier) x2(question mark multiplier)) Bear in mind that this breakdown might not be accurate for the holiday-themed upgrade that I just got from Tiny Death Star, because it seems there is now a "figure-out-where-this-character-should-go" type mission for question mark citizens where you are rewarded with cutscenes and other goodies. Edit: If you want to figure out whether you have the holiday-themed update or not: When you launch the game listen to the music. It will have a "holiday jingle" to it. Also your icon for the game will be covered in snow!
4. Bitizens with a ? can be delivered to any floor for 1 minute off whatever it's doing, a sales boost, and a double tip . Additionally, if delivered to a related level, the game will play a scene and add it to your album. See Which characters unlock each scene? for where to deliver them.
5. I had random bitizens with the '?' Above their head. I found that once you move the elevator they do tell you what level they want to go. But you can send them to any level you want to and they do shave 1 minute off construction time as well as give money. I don't know about the unlocking of the scenes. So far I've only unlocked the initial Mos Espa scene.
6. Two more things I've noticed: When you deliver a ? bitizen to a level it frequently causes the same sort of buying frenzy that you achieve with the Celebrity VIP. I don't think it lasts quite as long as the Celebrity VIP's effect. I've also seen that I get twice the tip for delivering them to their requested level than a regular bitizen pays. I can't confirm that this happens every time, but I've seen it very frequently.

1. Question mark characters are special characters. They can be delivered to any floor to double the tip.
2. The question mark on top of characters, means they are special or that they are characters related to a quest.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
The question mark characters are special characters that unlock cutscenes when delivered to the proper floor. Unlocked special characters always have question marks. Regular bitizens with question marks may also unlock cutscenes. Question mark citizens double the tip when delivered to their requested level.

Title: How long is it safe to drink coffee after brewed?
Question: How many hours/days would you recommend to drink coffee (after brewed) and consider it safe? (For example if you don't want to waste it). What is the difference if it is refrigerated or not?  The question is not about flavor since (I think) it is probably ruined after at most a couple of hours.
---- Answers ----
1. If it's refrigerated, it'll last for at least a week, as long as you didn't pre-dairy it. Unrefrigerated, I wouldn't trust it for more than a day. Coffee is a crappy growth medium and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy. Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all.
2. Oh dear. I wish I could answer this more anonymously. I am notorious among my friends and family for drinking old coffee left in the mug in the center console of the car,often for a week or more. Coffee is safe to drink, as far as I am concerned, as long as there are no fuzzy things growing on it .Today is Wednesday. At present, I am drinking a mug of room temperature coffee from a pot I made Monday afternoon. I make my coffee medium strength. It tastes acidic although I have never run a pH test on it. I use Chock Full O'Nuts brand when I can find it. I don't use any additive, flavors or sweeteners. I like it cold and black. Nothing bad has happened to me that I can attribute to old coffee; I have been doing this for perhaps 40 years since college. It was a habit I developed when I was very broke and never lost.
3. I keep post-brewed coffee in the fridge in a big glass container. It lasts for a long time; weeks! My buddy is a chef, and at his restaurant they make liquor/coffee/martinis--the bar keeps black coffee in the fridge for weeks. He insists it won't go bad for a month.
4. I've drank coffee I've left out for a few days without any noticeable consequence. It's always black, so I don't have any other components that go bad.
5. coffee doesnt grow mold for quite some time.. try it youself; saturate some coffee beans and some grounds and let them sit out.. normally 4-5 days until mold grows on the grounds .. 3 in warm conditions and since its diluted with all the water.. the first signs of mold I've actually seen are around 7 days in the pot.
6. We have always kept coffee outside for a week, no problem. No difference in taste. But, now that the idea of keeping in the fridge has been planted in my ears, I will do that.
7. If you freeze and make it as cubes then it will last very long. In fact, I am gonna do this. It's been a hassle to brew coffee every morning for a single person.
8. I brew a whole pot for myself and then refrigerate it (I drink it black). It usually takes me about 5 days to finish the pot. If I stretch it to 6 days, sometimes the last cup tastes "tinny" (metallic) and I don't enjoy it very much. Funny thing is, the freshly brewed (first day) cup is "just okay" as it tastes more tannic than the cups I have on day 2 through 5. Having it "mellow" in the refrigerator seems to make it taste smoother to me and I enjoy it more. I heat a single cup of it up in the microwave each morning. From reading other's comments, I can see I'm not with the crowd as most people detect a negative taste from coffee after just a few hours from brewing. Frankly, I like coffee most ways. I like the $6 hand-poured stuff where you can really taste the beans, and I'm fine with most diner coffee too (as long as its not too watery). I just feel its a waste to throw away coffee that's been brewed just because its not "fresh. " In my opinion, it just tastes different, but not "bad." To answer the actual question; I don't really know how long its safe, but almost all food is safe in the refrigerator for several days (as long as its not been sitting out too long) and in my years of experience with coffee, I feel comfortable with keeping it up to a week.
9. I believe that the process that you use in brewing and storing your coffee can make a difference. I have a coffee maker that you load with whole bean coffee and clear, cold water. Press a button and the coffee is ground and water drips through it and a filter into a vacuum bottle type container. It stays warm for hours, and when it is no longer hot enough for me I place a cup full in the microwave to heat up. It lasts for days with no deterioration. If I forget to dump the filter with the ground coffee in it, after a few days it will begin to develop mold. I also found that if I want to you have cold coffee. I can store the brewed coffee in a glass closed container in the refrigerator and simply add half-and-half and ice cubes to it when I'm ready to drink by the glass.
---- Gold summaries ----
1. Plain black coffee can last for a week or more in the fridge, or longer in the freezer, but is less durable when left out. It will grow mould after some time, but usually not for a few days at least.
2. You can keep coffee in or out of the fridge for several days without any problem.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
The answers said that coffee can last for a long time if it is refrigerated, but that it should not be kept for more than a day if it is not refrigerated. They also said that coffee does not usually grow mold for quite some time, and that it is generally safe to drink coffee that has been left out for a few days.

Title: Any advice to help me form and shape stuff more uniformly?
Question: I get frustrated by recipes which call for the cook to shape or form little balls out of a dough or cake or biscuit mix.  The recipe will say something like "form into little walnut sized balls ... should make about 16".   I always seem to end up with some larger than others. Individuals may look and taste good but it's a shame if they don't all look identical.  Anyone got any advice?
---- Answers ----
1. Use something that will help you measure the dough or mix uniformly. Some possible tools to co-opt for this task: Ice cream scoop, melon baller, measuring cups or spoons : all depending on size of course. You should be able to get to where you can eyeball the size in relation to the tool you are using.
2. If you have a dough that is dry enough (bread, cookies), the simplest method is to simply weigh your final dough, and then divide it into portions that weigh the same. You'll be exact every time. If you have something wetter but kinda keeps it's shape, like some cake mixes, I like to put it in a piping bag and then eyeball the portions. It does not take too much practice to get even portions. Though I sometimes fail at getting the correct number of portions. If it gets even wetter, use a measuring spoon. I suppose if you really plan ahead, you could also weigh all your containers first, and then you could weigh out the wetter mixtures too.
3. If your aim is truly for "identical", then the only real solution is practice. Certainly dividing your dough or batter into the requisite number of pieces before you start forming can help since you can do so more evenly than by scooping each one individually. However, the main thing that allows people to get uniform results is less by technique and more by making the item over and over.
4. I try to make items in quantities of powers of two. Cut the batch in half. Cut the halves in half. And so on. It's not as perfect as using a measuring device, but on the other hand you'll never have that remainder with which to contend.
5. I just made a batch of cookies (Walnut size) using a melon baller. Recipe called for 48 cookies and that is exactly what I got. The baller was not heaping, pretty much just filled to the top. Makes nice round cookies.
---- Gold summaries ----
1. You can use an ice cream scoop, melon baller, measuring cups or spoons to give an even size, or measure the dough by weight, especially with dough that is dry enough. For wetter mixes, try a piping bag. In all cases, your results will improve with practice.
2. Try using a melon baller  or weighing each ball.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
The main advice given was to use a tool to help measure the dough or mix uniformly, so that all the balls are the same size. Other tips included dividing the dough into pieces before forming them into balls, and making the item over and over again to get more uniform results.

Title: What happens when you die?
Question: Diablo's first and second installments handled death differently, both in terms of exp\gold penalties and also in if you respawned or not or instead had to reload from an earlier point.  In Diablo III what happens when you die?
---- Answers ----
1. This answer is outdated as of patch 2.0.1 - please see z's answer instead . When you die, you need to wait a few seconds and then your character respawns in the last check-point or at the beginning of the current dungeon floor. You respawn with full health, full resources (unless you're a barb), and in the same game state (so no monsters are resurrected). If you died during a boss of mini-boss fight (purple name), however, you respawn in the checkpoint right before the boss and the fight is completely reset - the boss has full HP again. If you are level 10 or above, you lose 10% of the current durability of each of your items.
2. As of patch 2.0.1, you are now given 3 options when you die (after a 3 second timer): Respawn at your corpse Has a countdown of 5 seconds Limited to a total of 3 times within a short period of time Cannot be used during boss fights. Seems to replenish a 'charge' once every 1-2 minutes. Respawn at the last checkpoint Instant No limit to number of times Respawn in town Instant No limit to number of times
3. In Diablo III, dead players respawn at the last checkpoint they reached. The good thing is that you no longer have to hunt for your corpse, the character will be wearing all the equipment and will have full health. I don't believe there is any experience or gold loss upon death either, but seems there is loss in durability of an item
4. Thankfully I have yet to die, but I did find this explaining death in Diablo 3 . Hardcore characters are as they were in Diablo II; mortal. One death there is the end of a character. Forever. For non-hardcore characters in Diablo III, death is a very temporary setback. Dead players can be resurrected by other players on the spot, or after a few second delay they may choose to respawn at the last checkpoint they reached. When they respawn they are wearing all of their equipment and have full health; there is no corpse to retrieve or loot as there was in Diablo 2. Characters do not lose any experience or gold upon death... As noted in their sit-down demo at E3, the developers did mention having to pay a hefty amount of gold in repairs after wiping.
5. When you die, and in a group. Each party member can resurrect you by activating your grave/remains. You can than select if to resurrect at that point, or resurrect at the last checkpoint (as stated before)*you still loose 10% durability if you are higher than level 10.
---- Gold summaries ----
1. You respawn in full health with full resources at your corpse. This is limited to a total of 3 times.
2. In Diablo 3, when a players death occurs, there are few options presented, depending on the type of character.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
The original poster is asking about what happens when you die in Diablo III. The first answer says that when you die, you Respawn at the last checkpoint you reached. The second answer says that you are given three options when you die: Respawn at your corpse, Respawn at the last checkpoint, or Respawn in town. The third answer says that when you die, you Respawn at the last checkpoint you reached and there is no experience or gold loss upon death. The fourth answer says that when you die, you can be resurrected by other players on the spot, or you can choose to Respawn at the last checkpoint you reached.

Title: Is it possible to play online with an XBox Live Silver account?
Question: I do not own an XBox, but a friend of mine does. I recently changed my regular on-console gamer profile to an XBox Live Silver profile so that I can use my profile on any XBox. I do want to play online occasionally, but I have heard that it is not possible to play online with a Silver profile.  I've seen several places say that its possible to play with online for select games; is this true? Where might I find such a list?  Thanks!
---- Answers ----
1. As it currently stands, you must have Gold privileges - either from your account, as part of a Family Pack, or as part of a promotion - to play online. Free (formerly known as Silver) and local accounts cannot otherwise play online. At one point, Microsoft did offer online play to Free/Silver members for select titles , but it was for a limited time, and that no longer appears to be the case. Final Fantasy XI is an exception, though: you can play online even with an Xbox Live Free account .
2. As far as I am aware, it is only possible to play multiplayer games online through Xbox Live if you have a gold account, or if you are playing on a Free Gold Weekend, which are special, and often rare, events that happen often to celebrate the release of a new title or occasionally for holidays.
3. You can play online with silver on certain games if you're on the same console and playing with a person who has gold. For example, the Halo games, although various limitations apply. There is a somewhat relevant list here.
4. You can play some games, as I have Crackdown 2 and I can play on multiplayer still.
5. I just went on cod mw3, for some reason it's letting me play on silver. I don't have any complaints!
---- Gold summaries ----
1. You can only play plutiplayer games if you have a gold account, or if you have a silver account and are playing on the same console as someone with a gold account.
2. There is a short list of games available online with an XBox Live Silver account, mainly with some restrictions.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
It is not possible to play online multiplayer games with an Xbox Live Silver account. However, there are some exceptions where you can play online with a Silver account if you are playing on the same console as someone with a Gold account.

Title: Is the question mark misused in affirmative sentences?
Question: For example, I found the following sentence written by a native English speaker (UK) so I'm going to assume that he knows how to put it the right way, although I wouldn't use this form.   I now have a bit more time to fix bugs  etc but I'm open to offers if anyone  wants to help maintain this module  with me?   Is it correct or is the question mark misused here?
---- Answers ----
1. While the sentence is not technically a question, the use of a question mark indicates that the speaker is inviting a response from others. In that respect, the question mark conveys the speaker's meaning in a way that could not otherwise be indicated in writing without the use of additional words. So I'd say that this use of the question mark is correct when recording informal speech like this - but formally, it should really be reserved for actual questions.
2. I now have a bit more time to fix bugs etc but I'm open to offers if anyone wants to help maintain this module with me? This sentence/question is different than a statement and different than the " up-talking " that happens when people occasionally (or all the #$! time) raise the pitch of their sentences and phrases. If the person said I now have a bit more time to fix bugs etc but I'm open to offers if anyone wants to help maintain this module with me. they are merely stating that they have time and are open to offers for help. By raising the pitch at then end (spoken) or adding the question mark (written) they are implying a question: Would anyone like to offer to help me? I hear this type of usage commonly. We will proceed with the next item on the agenda, unless there are any questions? no? Ok, moving along...
3. In written speech this is a questionable usage. Nevertheless, when speaking, people frequently end declarative sentences with a rising intonation to invite the listener to consider the sentence as an invitation to agreement or action. One hears this kind of thing especially in the southern United States. " Anyway, I had this Chrysler? It had a four-barrel carburetor?" Here the speaker is making declarations about a car, but making them sound like questions so that the listener will respond (probably nodding or saying "uh-huh") in a way that indicates interest in and understanding of the story being related. If your example sentence were spoken this way, listeners would likely interpret it as a request for help, not merely a statement of a condition. But if you write it, you should leave out the question mark. Addendum Since I wrote this, I've become aware that the practice of ending declarative sentences with a rising intonation actually has a name: uptalk n a manner of speaking in which declarative sentences are uttered with rising intonation at the end, as if they were questions.
4. This is something you see very often in spoken language. As we talk, we are making a syntactic structure. It's common for syntactic structures to change, or be re-analyzed, as we go along. So in this case, "if anyone wants to help maintain this module with me?" is reanalyzed, on the fly, as "Does anyone want to help maintain this module with me?" In careful writing, since readers can go back and check what you said previously, this sort of on the fly reanalysis is discouraged.
5. Just for the sake of anyone reading, I found this thread when I googled about this issue because Microsoft Word grammar checker tried to tell me that I should put a question mark at the end of this sentence: 'If you can do them in advance of this deadline then so much the better.' I completely disagree with such a usage in written English.
6. Steve Melnikoff's is the best analysis, but can be taken further. I think with the 'quick text parsing' that is becoming a part of our language pragmatics given the 'texting'/'information overload' age, punctuation marks in written materials are changing their purpose. As Melnikoff point out, in the example you use the question mark is inviting a response. The reader can visually 'skim' right through e.g., an email, to get at what his interlocutor wants him to respond to. The question mark is in effect basically an abbreviation with respect to what would have been written twenty years ago, when more verbiage would need to be required to have the request not come off in writing as rude. English in the twenty-first century (in a particular context, at any rate).
7. Another example which I don't think quite fits any of the explanations above occurs in social media where the question mark is used at the end of declarative statements intended as accusations or harsh judgements. The context shows the statement to be actually declarative, though it could be considered an interrogative in other contexts. However, the poster doesn't want to come across as socially abrasive or intends to leave room for backing off of the judgement in case there is a backlash of disagreement or reverse judgement. For example: "She is a narcissist?""A guy that overweight shouldn't be going to McDonald's?""Those so-called 'statues' are just toys for overgrown children?" In this case it is a fundamentally disingenuous usage, because the poster clearly has a strong negative opinion about someone or some group, such that they want to express it, but don't feel either confident enough in themselves or the view to post it as a genuine declaration. Another way to put it would be as an unconvincing attempt at avoiding social liability.
---- Gold summaries ----
1. This use of the question mark would be viewed by some as unacceptable or at the very least questionable. Other people would recommend limiting it to informal situations. In any case, the question mark here is inviting a response from others in a way that would require the use of additional words. As such, it may still be understood without much problem.
2. Some people do not agree with this usage in written English. It would be correct in informal speech, not for formally.Text parsing has caused us to change the use of punctuation marks.The statement is actually a declaration, though in another context could be considered an interrogative.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
The question mark is used to invite a response from others, to convey the speaker's meaning in a way that could not otherwise be indicated in writing without the use of additional words.

Title: How to pound chicken breasts without a meat tenderizer?
Question: I do not have a meat tenderizor. I want to fry my chicken breasts but need to pound out the meat. What can I use instead?
---- Answers ----
1. This might seem silly but, . . . I use my fist. I always cover my chicken with plastic wrap to contain the mess before I pound it. You can also glove up instead/as well. I have found that punching it is just the right amount of force for the job. And the uneven surface of my knuckles acts as a meat tenderizer and breaks up the tissue just a little. (But not too much.)
2. Anything flat, non-breakable, and reasonably heavy would work: rubber mallet, rolling pin, flat-bottomed wooden bowl, etc. I would suggest protecting the meat and implement from one another with plastic wrap.
3. Put breast between baking paper, roll like dough with a rolling pin. If you have any spices/herbs/salt/pepper to add you can sprinkle then mid rolling as this will push them inside meat.
4. Put it between two plastic sheets, or inside of a zipblock bag big enough to accommodate the smashed size of the breast. Then you're going to want to grab a skillet and beat that meat into submission. Cast iron is the classic here, but anything you can swing will work. Just make sure the skillet isn't hot or warm when you start assaulting that meat.
5. I've been known to cover with plastic wrap, lay my chef's knife flat along a piece of chicken, and then hit the flat of the blade with the heel of my hand. Obviously, stay away from the sharp / pointy parts; but that is easy to do with a big chef's knife. I typically only do this when I have one or two pieces of meat that need tenderizing (as anymore will tenderize you back!)
6. We designed ourselves a wooden block (remains from a 2" laminate floor joist) about 8" by 8", drilled a hole in one side, and screwed in a handle. When we use it, we wrap it around and around with plastic wrap to keep the meat clean. We would then use this as an intermediate, placing the chicken breasts underneath it, and pound it with a 3 lb sledge hammer. Though it sounds a bit extreme, it is actually quite effective, works quickly, and does not damage the meat.
7. I've seen my mother use a Corningware plate or saucer in place of a meat tenderizer. She would just hold the plate sideways and pound out the meat with the edge of the plate.
8. Iron Skillet (or another heavy pot/pan) Cutting board Rolling pin - really easy if you have the French tapered kind Big can of tomatoes... An empty wine bottle A pool ball (the kind you use on a table...not in the water!) Bon Appetit!
9. First off, you'll definitely want your chicken between two sheets of plastic. You can either do this with two sheets of plastic wrap, or by putting it in a gallon ziplock bag (don't seal it though). The best alternative tool to use is a rolling pin as it's got no sharp edges (will break your plastic and can cut the chicken in half) and has weight and length to aid in leverage when whacking. Not everyone has a rolling pin, so if you don't just grab the largest heaviest can of food you have and slam it into the chicken. I wouldn't use any beverage cans, and especially not anything carbonated like soda or beer. I actually have a purpose built meat tenderizer and prefer using my rolling pin.
10. I have used a cast iron skillet against a cutting board. Plastic wrap or parchment paper to protect the surfaces...
---- Gold summaries ----
1. Anything heavy, flat and non-breakable would work, like your fists, a rubber mallet, a rolling pin, a flat-bottomed wooden bowl, a cast iron skillet, a pool ball etc. Protect your surfaces and the meat with baking or parchment paper, and place the meat on a cutting board.
2. Two techniques are considered useful for tenderizing meat: rolling and hitting. For rolling a rolling pin is the tool of choice, but a wine bottle or pool ball are other options. For hitting select from a mallet, cast iron pan or your fist. In all cases the meat should be placed between sheets of plastic or parchment.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
The answers suggested using a variety of different objects to tenderize chicken breasts without a meat tenderizer, including fists, rubber mallets, rolling pins, and heavy pots and pans. It is important to protect the meat from the implement being used to tenderize it, by either wrapping it in plastic or placing it between two sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap.

Title: Is sushi so difficult?
Question: I've read somewere in the net that sushi is an extremely difficult food to prepare. It will take at least one year just to learn to cook the rice, and ten year to complete the experience.  It's so difficult? To do a comparison, one could prepare a decent home sushi like one can prepare a decent home dish after some years of home cooking?  It's more like a western chef that needs anyway to study and practice for a long time?
---- Answers ----
1. Like many crafts which originated in Japan, their sushi training more or less creates sushi artisans. If you just want to make a snack, you'll have plenty of ability given a basic review of techniques. You should focus your learning on understanding food-safety, getting the rice right, and making the roll not fall apart. The rest is just levels of mastery which you need not approach in your kitchen in order to experiment and enjoy a good dish.
2. I make sushi with friends about once a month, and it's not too difficult. The thing that took us the longest to get right was the rice, and we got that down after a few tries. It'll probably take a while to figure out the amount of vinegar you like in it, and how long to leave the seaweed in it while it's cooking. For nigiri, I've got a little plexiglass box for molding the rice, which makes it somewhat easier to get it a regular shape. It probably wouldn't be too hard to find one, if you're really into making nigiri and don't want to just do it by hand. We also tried making tamago (sweetened omelet) from scratch last time, and it came out really well. We weren't able to make it the proper thickness and have it cook properly, so we ended up making a bunch of very thin layers, stacking them, then rolling them up and slicing them. We've started making sunomono as well, which makes a good opening to the meal. Thinly-sliced cucumber, mackerel, and a little bit of miso dressing cut with some mirin (sweetened rice wine). Sometimes we throw a little seaweed salad on top, as well.
3. To be a professional, yes there are schools in Japan that take several years to complete including lengthy apprenticeship requirements. That said, I've taken a 3 hour sushi class and I can make sushi rice, maki, nigiri, and hand rolls just fine. They sometimes lack a little in the appearance department though.
4. Personally- I use the sushi rice recipe from "The Joy of Cooking" and it worked on the first try. You should definitely not be afraid to try it. It took a couple tries getting the technique right for making the rolls but it's a fun family activity as the children get to pick their fillings, etc.
5. If you haven't seen it already, check out the sushi documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi. He is 86 years old and a national treasure of Japan. Even he, himself, says he has not mastered sushi. He dreams all the time of how to improve his techniques. Hence the name of the movie "Jiro Dreams of Sushi". I was able to successfully make my own sushi after two attempts. The hardest thing to grasp is the amount of labor and techniques needed for the rice. I first had sushi while living in Australia and watched a food tv show about Outback Bush cooking, with a Bushman cook. I watched him make maki rolls by hand with fish he caught. After I saw that, I decided I wanted to learn. It's worthwhile to research how to prepare the rice correctly because 50% of sushi is pure rice. Good luck!

Title: What uses are there for basil flowers?
Question: I have tons of basil in my herb spiral.  However, this stuff is precious, and I always feel bad when I throw away the basil flowers when I make pesto sauce.  Is there a way to use the basil flowers when cooking?
---- Answers ----
1. If you pinch off the basil flowers as they start to grow, the plant will produce more leaves. (Yes, this is a horticultural answer, but it will help you make more yummy dishes with the leaves.)
2. If you wanted to use them in cooking, I would recommend putting them in a sachet (a small pouch made of cheesecloth/muslin tied with cooking twine), as I know some people who don't actually like to eat the flowers, but enjoy the bitter tang they'll add to a dish. They are edible, however, so if it turns out you like them, they make a beautiful garnish for a salad. I'm not a huge fan, so I generally stick with Martha's suggestion and keep them pinched so the plant produces more leaves. Once the flowers appear, the plants energy and resources become more dedicated to flowering, and the leaf growth suffers. As mentioned in my comment on Martha's answer, I find that when the leaf growth suffers, the flavor of the leaves suffers as well. This site recommends putting the basil flowers in olive oil, shaking, and leaving on a window sill for a month to make a light basil olive oil. I've never tried this, and I'm interested, though I'm a little wary of leaving olive oil in a clear container in the sun for a month. The general idea seems cool, though.
3. I love basil flowers. They are so much fun and I use them all the time. I have noticed that different varieties of basil at different times of the summer/growth stage will result in more bitter or delicate tasting buds. You'll just have to experiment, but I have definitely had some really floral tasting flowers this summer. I'll throw them into a pesto for a more complex, slightly bitter flavor - I just make sure to pick off any woody stems. They are a beautiful garnish for just about any stonefruit (plums, peaches, nectarines) - how about roast some fruit, serve with ricotta and some honey...with basil flowers? They are gorgeous in salads or panzanella.... anything with tomatoes. Finally, my favorite thing to do is use them to make basil flower ice cream. Steep them along with basil leaves in a plain ice cream base and remove them once you have achieved the flavor you desire. Keep in mind the flavor will develop if you let the base sit overnight (which I recommend) and it will also continue to strengthen a tad as it sits in the freezer. This is generally not a problem if you are making a small batch at home, but more of tip for professionals.
4. Yes, you can use them just as you'd use basil leaves. They're generally milder tasting and more decorative in your dish. Also - from flowers to seeds - a new harvest is also an opportunity.
5. Vinegar. Pinch off the blossoms and pack them in a jar, cover with white vinegar, seal and keep in the fridge for a few weeks to flavor through... Then discard the blossoms and use the vinegar for dressings or marinades. Delicious stuff... Use sparingly though!
6. If you grow African Blue Basil, you'll have a TON of flowers that are not at all bitter at any time. We use them in all kinds of cooking, but our favorite use is to make Basil Bud Ice Cream. Literally the best ice cream I've ever tasted. The flavor of these flowers is the basil itself with strong floral overtones that mesh well. Great fresh as a salad topper too. Honestly, you haven't lived until you try growing African Blue Basil. Everyone raves about it and everything we make with it. Just finished a MONSTER batch of pesto to keep us through the winter. Best plant I've ever grown, bar none. We had about 50-60 plants this year. Also, definitely top them as they grow in tridents and by topping them, you cause them to bush out a lot more dramatically.
7. Using basil flowers in my fresh tomatoes I'm cooking down to can is Excellent! Strong in flavour but I like that. If you don't dilute it! :-) ~
8. Dry basic flowers can be used to make a awesome little potpourri pouch or a small sachet :)
9. Basil flowers can be eaten, for instance in soup.
10. I love putting the flowers along with lavender, lemon balm and mint in some water and once it almost hits boiling point putting it on low then drinking as tea. Super yummy.
11. I plant Basil along with my Tomatoes to deter insects. One Basil Plant every fifth Tomato Plant, and it really works quite well. I keep cutting the flowers off until near the end of the Tomato season, and then let them go. I have some African bushes that are three feet tall, and app. three feet in diameter. I usually give most away as either fresh, or I hang them in the shed to dry for people who like to preserve them. We do use some for flavoring, especially when we can Salsa or other Tomato products like juice, soup mix, etc.
12. I grow Queen Siam Thai Basil and Genovese Basil. I use the flowers in soups and pesto mostly and I don't notice them being bitter or making the leaves bitter once the plants start flowering. The flowers do seem to have a condensed flavor. I do however snip the basil leaves while they are young and smallish since the taste seems cleaner and fresher when small.

Title: Why did Cypher betray Morpheus?
Question: The film demonstrates that Morpheus and the other liberated humans can enter the Matrix while in disguise, and in addition can generate their own virtual environments (eg, Neo and Morpheus sparring).  Doesn't Cypher have plenty of opportunities to enjoy a virtual steak and the other amenities of virtual life without betraying Morpheus?
---- Answers ----
1. The transcript for "The Matrix" makes Cypher's motives pretty clear; Not only does he want to re-enter the Matrix permanently but he alsowants to return to a state of blissful ignorance as a "blue-pill". He fervently believes that the machines can remove painful memories and reinsert him into the Matrix as someone special . With the arrival of Neo, his unrequited fantasies towards Trinity (arguably the only good thing he's got in his miserable life) have been crushed severing his final connection with Zionese culture. CYPHER : I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing! You understand? And I want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor. You can do that, right? AGENT SMITH : Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan. Cypher takes a deep drink of wine. CYPHER : All right. You get my body back in a power plant, reinsert me into the Matrix and I'll get you what you want. and Cypher: I know what you're thinking, 'cause right now I'm thinking the same thing. Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here: Why oh why didn't I take the blue pill and Cypher: You know, for a long time, I thought I was in love with you . I used to dream about you. You're a beautiful woman, Trinity. Too bad things had to turn out this way. Also, you can never underestimate the appeal of a really good steak;
2. He wanted to reset his memory and forget about the Matrix. There is no evidence that the "liberated humans" could do that to themselves. It was also implied that he would be inserted in the Matrix as President Ronald Reagan (see, for example this ). According to Wikipedia: Cypher has grown tired of the Man/Machine war within the real world. Harshly disillusioned with the grim existence of living on a hovercraft and tired of following Morpheus and his blind faith in the Prophecy, he has begun to wish that he had never learned the truth and left the Matrix in the first place.
3. I agree with what the other answers are saying about why he wants to go back to the blissful state of the "blue pill". As for why he betrays Morpheus, what he says when he reveals his betrayal indicates that he resents and feels betrayed by Morpheus. Cypher : "He lied to us, Trinity. He tricked us. If you'da told us the truth, we woulda told you to shove that red pill right up your ass." Trinity : " That's not true, Cypher, he set us free." Cypher : " Free? You call this free? All I do is what he tells me to do. If I had to choose between that and the Matrix, I choose the Matrix." He feels like a slave to the person who has tricked him into a dystopian reality.
4. Because metaphor. Neo represents every teenage boy; you are leet, you discover something secret but world-changing, you are initiated into a new world and the scales fall from your eyes. It is a metaphor for becoming an adult. Cypher represents defeatism, the impulse to give up and run away and be turned back into a little boy. He is the embodiment of the moment after you are rejected by a potential partner for the first time. I want to go home. Morpheus, by contrast, is the father. He is the one who affirms Neo's maturation and believes completely in him. Why does Cypher betray Morpheus? Because Morpheus' role to support the rite of passage into adulthood is worthless if it is better to remain a child, and Cypher rejects the truth. Also, as an allegory it illustrates how futile it is to attempt to return to the child state; once we know, we cannot unknow. Following the logic, this allegory is telling us that hedonism (satisfying the senses) is not sufficient for happiness; the story embraces purpose (and even ideas of destiny) over sensuality.
5. Certain physical pleasures like steak could presumably be reproduced in private simulations, but I think the restaurant scene was meant to illustrate his overall desire for "the good life" of a wealthy person in the Matrix, and a lot of the supposed appeal of great wealth is interpersonal in nature, not just physical--like the desire for a shortcut to getting the respect of lots of people (including glamorous wealth-seeking mates), getting into certain high-profile "in-crowds", paying people for creative services like DJing your party or painting your portrait, being able to buy influence in politics or the media, etc. None of these would likely be very satisfying if he was just in a private simulation with a bunch of simple simulated people like the woman in the red dress (and even if Zion had the ability to create more genuinely intelligent simulated people, they probably wouldn't because of fear that they would take the side of the machines in the Matrix and rebel from within). Edited to add that this section of the Cypher's lines that Richard quoted above supports the idea that this was at least part of Cypher's motivation: "And I want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor. You can do that, right?"
6. CYPHER : I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing! You understand? And I want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor. You can do that, right? AGENT SMITH : Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan. Cypher takes a deep drink of wine. CYPHER : All right. You get my body back in a power plant, reinsert me into the Matrix and I'll get you what you want. Surely his reasoning is flawed when he says he wants to remember nothing, is getting your memory totally wiped not the same as being killed? The Cypher who wakes up after such a procedure shares nothing with the old Cypher except his body

---- GPT-3 summary ----
The answers said that Cypher betrayed Morpheus because he wanted to go back to the blissful state of ignorance that he was in before he learned about the Matrix. He also resents and feels betrayed by Morpheus. Additionally, the restaurant scene was meant to illustrate his overall desire for the good life that he could have in the Matrix.
