Title: Has The 7th Guest entered the public domain?
Question: I know that Trilobyte, the creators of  The 7th Guest , went out of business some time ago.  Has their work entered the public domain in some way?  If not, who owns the copyright for their works?
---- Answers ----
1. Trilobyte has re-released the 7th guest for the iPad and the iPhone at the end of 2010. The second in the series "11th hour" will be released "summer 2011". In November 2010 Trilobyte was resurrected, so that means they still have the copyright for the games.
2. In general, if nobody official has said that the game – or any of the materials associated with it – is Public Domain, it is not . Copyright simply does not work like that; someone will own it as it is an asset of either the developer or the publisher (or, these days, their creditors or people that the creditors sold it on to).
3. Some quick research learns that since The 7th Guest was published by Virgin Interactive, the rights to the game should still lie with them. Additionally, Amazon is still selling the game, so it's probably not in PD.
4. I believe that works owned by a corporation automatically enter public domain 95 years after release or 120 years after creation, whichever is first. It used to be 28 years with a chance for one time 28 year renewal. They changed it in the 70s and added 20 years to it in the late 90s. The only way a game is in the public domain at this point is if the company releases it themselves. Abandonware, however, is a concept which extends from the lack of enforcement of copyright by game companies which are no longer making money from the software. Since other answerers have said that it was just re-released, I somehow doubt they'll fail to go after you. It should be noted that abandonware has no legal standing in the US right now. It is currently officially illegal to distribute games commonly considered to be abandonware. A few years ago, the Library of Congress issued an exception for software only on media which is obsolete, but only as far as cracking DRM to archive the software with no allowance for distribution. This exception was for a period of two years with the chance for renewal, but was three years ago I believe Note : I am not a lawyer Source: Wikipedia
5. Trilobyte Games, and specifically founder Rob Landeros, have scrupulously maintained rights to all Trilobyte properties, with the exception of Clandestiny (the subject of a side agreement with Graeme Devine), over the years. Before the company was reorganized last year, the newly constituted organization headed by original founder Landeros & new partners Charlie McHenry & John Fricker retained the intellectual property practice of Northwest legal powerhouse Lane Powell Spears & Lubersky to ensure all intellectual property was properly assigned, ownership was clear, and no obstacles existed to the re-issue of 7th Guest and other properties. With that due diligence out complete, the titles entered the queue for re-release. Any inquiries regarding these matters are properly directed to Trilobyte Games, LLC in Medford, Oregon.
6. The publisher at the time was Virgin Interactive, they probably own the copyright for 7th guest. Virgin Interactive doesn't do much these days, but they are owned by the Virgin Group

1. Trilobyte re-released the 7th guest for iPad and iPhone. The rights to the game are still with Virgin Interactive. The game would only become public domain if the company released it.

Title: Are Steam price cuts predictable?
Question: From observation, can I expect that a game will get a permanent price cut (or a weekend special deal) X weeks after its launch, or after the sales dropped by Y percent or whatever other reason?
---- Answers ----
1. If nothing else, you can be sure that if you pay attention and wait long enough, the game you so look forward to will be on sale eventually. I have yet to buy a game on Steam without a significant discount. I've had to wait quite a bit for some of them, but the vast majority will come on sale after a while.
2. It's common for them to discount GAME X in the run up/at the release of GAME X2. So, for example, expect the Fallout 3 pack to get a price drop pretty soon because New Vegas is due in October.
3. Short answer: no. Slightly longer answer: price cuts Noooooo, sales yes.ie the Summer sale (no way to tell what tho) or discounts on iD games during QuakeCon
4. Because the discounts and prices are negotiated with the publishers, you'd be better off trying to analyse on the publisher level rather than across Steam as a whole. Additionally, because people would put off buying a game if they knew it was going to be discounted shortly, Steam will most likely purposefully avoid any such pattern (to ensure maximum revenue).
5. The summer sale and winter holiday sales are predictable and always offer insane/awesome sales. Your best bet would to check Steam every week and see is on on sale for that week. For example I picked up Borderlands and its first three expansions for $22 one random week.
6. I haven't seen a pattern on new games but, I have seen that Valve will reduce the price of the previous version of their own games (and some that they distribute) just before a sequel comes out. They also tend to offer discounts/packages on holiday weekends. This is mostly on independent games and retro packages. Finally, they tend to offer free games when celebrating an event like the release of Portal when the Mac version of Steam was released. In the later case they like to drop hints that something is coming but like to keep the details a surprise.
7. In addition to what others are saying, I've noticed independent games are often given discounts relatively shortly after their release (like a month or two), while big-publisher titles maintain their price for a longer time.
8. When a similar or better game of the same genre is about to launch, it will become very likely that the older game will get a discount. Modern Warfare 2 got a 33% discount in the week of the launch of Medal of Honor.
9. bad, old, and boring games will get discounts :) Usually it happened on Thursday, so people could buy them on Friday to play at weekend. Often presales are cheaper, because people don't know how bad is game, so they buy it to try. Another time is when most players stop playing multiplayer game, so making 50-70% discounts bring more people(and money) as servers are already working and there is capacity for players. And one more case: when new game is almost released (e.g. civ5), then previous versions get discount, because almost nobody will buy them after release.
---- Gold summaries ----
1. No. Summer and winter sales are predictable times. They will often discount the first game just before its sequel comes out.
2. Whereas price-cuts per se are probably not predictable, sales are. Furthermore, educated guesses can be made at the publisher level or around the release of successor games.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
From the answers, it seems that there is no clear or predictable pattern to Steam sales or price cuts. However, it is common for Steam to offer discounts on older games when a new game in the same genre is about to be released, and independent games are often given discounts relatively shortly after their release. Additionally, bad, old, and boring games will often get discounts.

Title: Is it possible to play online with an XBox Live Silver account?
Question: I do not own an XBox, but a friend of mine does. I recently changed my regular on-console gamer profile to an XBox Live Silver profile so that I can use my profile on any XBox. I do want to play online occasionally, but I have heard that it is not possible to play online with a Silver profile.  I've seen several places say that its possible to play with online for select games; is this true? Where might I find such a list?  Thanks!
---- Answers ----
1. As it currently stands, you must have Gold privileges - either from your account, as part of a Family Pack, or as part of a promotion - to play online. Free (formerly known as Silver) and local accounts cannot otherwise play online. At one point, Microsoft did offer online play to Free/Silver members for select titles , but it was for a limited time, and that no longer appears to be the case. Final Fantasy XI is an exception, though: you can play online even with an Xbox Live Free account .
2. As far as I am aware, it is only possible to play multiplayer games online through Xbox Live if you have a gold account, or if you are playing on a Free Gold Weekend, which are special, and often rare, events that happen often to celebrate the release of a new title or occasionally for holidays.
3. You can play online with silver on certain games if you're on the same console and playing with a person who has gold. For example, the Halo games, although various limitations apply. There is a somewhat relevant list here.
4. You can play some games, as I have Crackdown 2 and I can play on multiplayer still.
5. I just went on cod mw3, for some reason it's letting me play on silver. I don't have any complaints!
---- Gold summaries ----
1. You can only play plutiplayer games if you have a gold account, or if you have a silver account and are playing on the same console as someone with a gold account.
2. There is a short list of games available online with an XBox Live Silver account, mainly with some restrictions.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
It is not possible to play online multiplayer games with an Xbox Live Silver account. However, there are some exceptions where you can play online with a Silver account if you are playing on the same console as someone with a Gold account.

Title: How do you defeat big spiderants?
Question: How do you deal with big spiderants?  They take basically no damage unless you hit them in the abdomen. And the big ones are hard to disorient. I'm playing hunter, so sniper rifles and revolvers are my most used guns.
---- Answers ----
1. From the Borderlands Wiki : Shotguns work well against Spiderants, not only because they can easily disorient, but also because follow-up blasts to the abdomen can usually take down even the toughest specimen. The larger varieties of Spiderant, particularly Badasses, are also much harder to disorient by comparison to their smaller counterparts or even when compared to the optional bosses. A solution is to focus the targeting element on the upper fringe of the armored head while backpedaling. Due to a collision detection quirk involving their walk animation, several of these shots will register as abdomen hits, dealing critical damage from the front even though the abdomen itself is not truly exposed. A player with a good elemental (preferably corrosive, due to its long DoT duration) weapon can keep a spiderant completely defenseless as they stagger and are open to abdomen attacks. This is also one of the only reliable ways of staggering a "Badass" Spiderant Essentially, shots aimed high may count as critical hits, and an elemental attribute to your weapon can only help.
2. I usually drive over the bastards as much as possible.
3. I generally swap to a high capacity SMG and fire off bursts of shots while strafing/backpeddling. The reason for the burst firing is to get the disorienting shots to trigger so they turn. If they don't, just keep burst firing. Once they've turned their abdomen is wide open and you can unload the rest of the clip for almost 100% critical shots against the spiderants.
4. I always relied on elemental damage to kill them, using either corrosive or fire damage to do a bulk of the work. That has worked for me with a Siren or Soldier. With SMGs and Assault Rifles, you tend to get abdomen shots occasionally while circle strafing, even when it isn't stunned, which also helps. As a Hunter, I'd try and rely on pistols with 3x or 4x elemental component (Defiler comes to mind), and let the DoT do the damage. This will prevent you from dumping all of your ammo into them.
5. To add to Keaanu's answer, since you're playing as a hunter, using a masher revolver instead of a shotgun might be a good idea. The skills in the gunslinger tree, especially gun crazy, can help make up for the lack of an element on mashers and you've probably got decent revolver proficiency bonuses built up by now too.
6. If you wish to take out "the big ones" with ease, you should aim for the abdomen as much as you can. This is easy to do at range, as long as you get the timing right. Keep them at a distance, and get them to use their ranged attack. When they do this they hug the ground, while pushing up their abdomen, making the Critacal Spot an easy target. You can also kill them with a SMG "Anarchy" because as it says on the wiki: "The Anarchy SMG fires a spray of four projectiles per shot at the expense of two rounds from the magazine. This effect essentially turns the SMG into a high-speed Shotgun that is able to throw up a "wall of flak" I'm a soldier myself, and have taken out just about everything with my Double Anarchy (Even the Badass versions) Hope that helps
7. I've found that things like explosive SMGs have been very effective for me. It seems to me that the abdomens of spiderants seem to have extra vulnerability to explosive damage.
8. I always carry a back up corrosive weapon, and I suggest you make one or two part of your loadout. The game itself states you should use corrosive weapons for armored enemies like Spiderants and Alpha Skags. The best thing for them is a corrosive shotgun. Because of the spread shot it will hit the abdomen or belly when not directly aiming there. Or, if you prefer a bit more accuracy, a corrosive revolver or sniper will make short work of them.
---- Gold summaries ----
1. Shotgunswork well against spiderants. You can also use a masher revolver and carry a back up corrosive weapon.
2. Several types of weapons are suggested as legitimate options.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
The best way to defeat big spiderants is to shoot them in the abdomen with a shotgun, revolver or sniper rifle. An elemental weapon can also be effective. Another method is to drive over them with a vehicle.

Title: How do I kill the second boss (Yelena Fedorova) in Deux Ex: Human Revolution?
Question: Possible Duplicate:  How do I beat the Picus boss?     I have a heavy rifle with about 170 ammo, no grenades, no typhoon aug.   How do I kill her? I tried just putting all the heavy rifle ammo into her but she kills me before I can unload one clip.
---- Answers ----
1. There are lockers around the room with EMP grenades and ammo/weapons in them. You can knock her out with the EMPs (though be careful to not knock your augmentations out at the same time) and then unload all you've got while she's paralyzed. Repeat as needed. Try to always stay on the move and don't let her get close to you. You should be able to stay moving long enough to heal up in-between the "paralyze and shoot" rounds. I also recommend saving after each round, so you don't have to restart all the way from the beginning of the fight if things go sour.
2. There are two ways to kill her: One is to collect the EMP grenades scattered between the generators. Throw an EMP grenade and unleash lead to kill her (as mentioned by Anna Lear). Or the second option, which is a lot easier, is to get the EMP shielding upgrade for the Dermal Armour (if you do not have this upgrade, load an earlier save if you have one and upgrade). With this upgrade you can shoot the generators which will cause an EMP burst which will immobilise her and you will be free to shoot her, because you have the EMP shielding augmentation you will NOT be affected by the EMP burst. I found this boss the easiest of the bunch because of this augmentation.
3. The only way I could beat her was to blow up the generators around the outside of the arena and jump around like a madman until they stop shocking me. Rinse and repeat for all four generators. Then I just had to put a few bullets in her and she went down.
4. There are several good ways. See the Deus Ex Wiki for a fairly comprehensive list (under Fedorova Tactics ). I've played through the game 6 times, and now I always rely on the stun gun: the boss battles frankly annoy me, and I've found stun gun to be the simplest, most mindless way to end this one. Just shoot it enough times—about 25 times on normal difficulty I believe— and then you get to return to the "real" game. Even if I don't need the stun gun for anything else, it's worth it to carry one for this and certain other encounters.
5. The simplest fastest solution is to use the Typhoon System. It only takes 2-3 typhoon blasts on normal difficulty and she's dead. It took me less than 30 seconds this way...
6. Ok, I was stuck on this for ages as I had no grenades at all. All you have to do is this: lay an emp mine near one of the 4 generators around the outer circle. Let her rush up to you with her attack near the mine, but stand back enough so you aren't killed. In the lockers there are health kits and hypnotism sticks so make sure you have one of these to use straight away so you are not killed by the electricity from the exploded generator. Now While she is stunned you just need to pump about 6 times with the stun gun and she dies. The trick is to make sure you aren't killed by the electricity in the first instance.
7. I found a Combat Rifle with a Target-Seeking System mod attached very useful while fighting Deus Ex: HR bosses. Fedorova died 30s after the beginning of a fight, Namir even quicker.
8. The P.E.P.S. is good for this since it stuns her for several seconds. Stun her, switch weapons and shoot her. There's a glitch way to do it on the PC version at least. Stun her with the P.E.P.S. then run up to her and crouch. She can't seem to attack you in that situation and she's stuck. Then you can whittle her down with the pistol or something else if you like.
---- Gold summaries ----
1. You can knock her out with EMPs or get the EMP shielding upgrade. You can also try Typhoon System and lay an emp mine near one of the 4 generators.
2. The most prominent strategy is to stun her and then shoot her. Repeat until goal is achieved.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
The best way to kill Yelena Fedorova is to either use EMP grenades or the EMP shielding augmentation. If you have neither of those, you can try to blow up the generators around the room or shoot her with a stun gun.

Title: What can I use firewood for? Is the supply unlimited?
Question: I found a wood axe and a chopping block near to each other in a camp somewhere and so became aware that I could use the axe with the chopping block to (very slowly) produce firewood.  Does firewood have any purpose other than just being low-value merchant fodder? Can I set up camp fires, maybe, or something else?  Also, does a chopping block ever run out like ore seems do? (I got bored quickly so didn't test more than a couple of chops)
---- Answers ----
1. In most of the locations where you can chop firewood, there will be an NPC nearby who will buy any firewood you chop for 5G a piece. Early in the game, it's a nice way to raise a few coins while running AFK to grab a drink or while typing up a question or answer here at Gaming. SE. Firewood is also used to improve a few low level weapons, notably the Long Bow, at a grindstone. And yes, the supply is unlimited. The truly dedicated could chop enough wood to buy and furnish a house.
2. You can use the firewood to create arrows at a blacksmith's forge if you have the Dawnguard DLC. Ebony arrows require a Smithing level of 80 and the Ebony perk to create. 1 x Ebony Ingot 1 x Firewood Daedric arrows require a Smithing level of 90 and the Ebony perk to create. 1x Firewood 1x Ebony Ingot 1x Daedra Heart Dragonbone arrows require a Smithing level of 100 and the Dragon Armor perk to create. 1 x Dragon Bone 1 x Firewood
3. Firewood just seems to be low-value merchant fodder. There are a few more of these things, for example you can go to a saw mill and load logs/ cut them, you can pick crops for farmers and get paid for it. Doesn't have much a purpose other than to add a bit of average joe jobs to the game.
4. It is also probably put in the game by Bethesda as a modders resource. They probably think that when the construction set comes out, someone will make it so you can light a fire or put them on extinguished fires at camps. Mostly, it is just used for making some easy gold.
5. Go to Whiterun and then in front of The Bannered Mane is a wood cutter block. Use it then go inside and sell your firewood. Easy profit :D
6. There is a man in Morthal who buys your firewood. He stands right next to the woodmill and the wood cutter block. In my experience that's the best place to sell, since you dont even have to walk (making it easy even when you get overloaded).
7. I have worked out the math here: 1 log = 2 planks (the finished product that ends up in your inventory) 1 plank = 5 g 1 chop cycle = 1 bundle = 6 planks = 30g Also good for improving a few basic weapons (namely the longbow) to increase profit 2x-3x

Title: When do merchants start paying the actual value of items without bonus effects and perks?
Question: When you pick up items in Skyrim it tells you the value of each item. However when I go and sell the items the merchants are only paying 30% of this value, at best.  Discounting any perks or other effects, how high does Speechcraft have to be before merchants start paying full value for items?
---- Answers ----
1. Sounds like you have low Speech Speech will directly affect the prices paid when buying from and selling to merchants, even without the assorted perks. At 0 speech, merchants will sell items for 3 times their base price, and buy for a third of their base price. At 100 speech, merchants will sell items for twice their base price and buy for half.
2. The value in your inventory is the worth of the item. Vendors will give you a percentage of that value based on your speechcraft skill and other factors. Likewise they will sell it for a multiple of that value. Specifically the price is: Sell price = [ value of item ] / [ 3.3 - (1.3 * [speech skill]/100) ] * [(1 + Haggling %) * (1 + Allure %) * (1 + Fortify Barter from potion) * (1 + the sum of Fortify Barter from equipment + Fortify Barter from Blessing of Zenithar) From the UESP Wiki.
3. Are you using your perks on speech at all? You need to pick the basic speech improvement perk at the bottom of the tree. It'll get the vendors to sell at a much better rate. Simply ramping up to 100 will help a bit, but not nearly as much as the perks.
4. You can easily get the true value without the speech perks ( accounting for 100 speech skill). Some ways: Mask of Clavicus Vile, a deadric (daedric?) artifact -> 20% betterprices (also known as Fortify Barter - FB) Thieves guild helmets 10% nooby ones 15% better set (I think) Cicero breast piece -> 20% better prices Amulet of Zenitar -> 10% better prices An necklace of another deity (which I don't remember) - 10%. I found it with my first character ever Sometimes you can find necklaces in general stores with FB up to 20% With all the best items above you can get 60%+50% from 100 speech, that gets you 110%. I'm not sure if you can actually get more than the true value for items but you could always try. I'm fairly sure I didn't listed all FB equipment in the game. Now say can't get all the equipment listed abover or, for RP reasons chose not to, then there are FB potions; which would be "random of haggling" and the higest I've seen was either 30 or 40% in the game. Then there's the fact that many skills can be used to make large amount of cash such as: Normal Enchanting Alchemy (easiest I think) Blacksmith ( after the first 60 levels it starts paying off itself I think) For those shadey characters, you can pickpocket everyone in Riften. If you get caught - and you're in the Thieves Guild - you only have to pay half of the bounty normally is. And guys if you're having trouble with money try doing a bunch of petty quests or some factions Quest line. Faction Quest lines are always very rewarding.
5. I have gotten at least 61% confirmed sale value out of my x360 legendary edition of skyrim with all expansions and patches that were given for consoles. My speech is only about 69 or 70 right now, I have only one rank of haggling, another 35% of fortify barter from equipment, and no bonus from allure. I did not calculate buy value just now but the 2/1 ration should roughly hold so I should be buying items at around 125-135% of actual value depending just how specifically the math works out. I'm not sure what that last 30% of speech penalty does to affect the other math without sitting down and doing it all longhand.
---- Gold summaries ----
1. Pick up the basic speech improvement perk at the bottom of the tree.
2. To improve bartering skills and sell at higher value, the most simple way is to advance the speech improvement perk.
---- GPT-3 summary ----
The answers say that the value in your inventory is the worth of the item, and that vendors will give you a percentage of that value based on your speechcraft skill and other factors. They also say that you can get a better price from vendors by using perks and by wearing certain types of equipment. Finally, they say that you can get a higher percentage of the true value of items by using potions and by doing quests for factions.

Title: What is the most common method to find a group for a Flashpoint?
Question: So I just got my first empire Flashpoint, a 2 player job. Since it starts from the fleet, I don't really want to just ask in fleet general chat if anyone wants to do the quest with me. Is there a better way to find groups for Flashpoints? Such as a built in system that I am missing?
---- Answers ----
1. In my experience, being in the fleet and going "/1 [my class] LFG [name of flashpoint]" works reasonably well. Alternately, paying attention to General and responding when someone goes "[flashpoint] group LF[number]M" for much the same reason. EDIT : Update 1.3 introduced the Group Finder Queue , and gives out bonus commendations once a day for using it. Learn it. Use it. The more people who use it well, the better it works.
2. Gather in the flashpoint location and flag yourself in /who or in the Social window (Press "O") as LFG, you can also leave a short note there (E.g., "LFG Hammer" or just "hammer"). You can then search for people with LFG tags. It's nice tool, but it's a shame not many people use it.
3. Most people post in general, so I would just do it. It's effective. Sometimes you'll also find people waiting outside the start area for the quest, and you can invite them or vice-versa. It's particularly unambiguous if you or they have the purple LFG icon hovering above you by setting your status in the /who list, as Krazer notes. I've noticed that most people don't use the LFG flag, unfortunately.. See Andrzej's answer for a description of the new Group Finder tool, which is another option.
4. With the recent addition of patch 1.3, the Group Finder is by far the easiest/most effective way to get groups together for flashpoints (both heroic and normal), story-mode Operations, and heroic quests on planets. It's available from level 10 onwards as a tab next to the minimap. See the linked official guide for full details.
5. Posting in channels can be an effective way of finding groups (though not as ideal as an automatic queueing system or a commonly used /who system). Other games that do have these more effective systems still manage groups with this method. That said, a piece of advice: If you are partied with no one else, but are willing to start a party, post with "LFM" instead of "LFG". People will be more likely to send you a tell if they too are looking.

Title: What happens when you die?
Question: Diablo's first and second installments handled death differently, both in terms of exp\gold penalties and also in if you respawned or not or instead had to reload from an earlier point.  In Diablo III what happens when you die?
---- Answers ----
1. This answer is outdated as of patch 2.0.1 - please see z's answer instead . When you die, you need to wait a few seconds and then your character respawns in the last check-point or at the beginning of the current dungeon floor. You respawn with full health, full resources (unless you're a barb), and in the same game state (so no monsters are resurrected). If you died during a boss of mini-boss fight (purple name), however, you respawn in the checkpoint right before the boss and the fight is completely reset - the boss has full HP again. If you are level 10 or above, you lose 10% of the current durability of each of your items.
2. As of patch 2.0.1, you are now given 3 options when you die (after a 3 second timer): Respawn at your corpse Has a countdown of 5 seconds Limited to a total of 3 times within a short period of time Cannot be used during boss fights. Seems to replenish a 'charge' once every 1-2 minutes. Respawn at the last checkpoint Instant No limit to number of times Respawn in town Instant No limit to number of times
3. In Diablo III, dead players respawn at the last checkpoint they reached. The good thing is that you no longer have to hunt for your corpse, the character will be wearing all the equipment and will have full health. I don't believe there is any experience or gold loss upon death either, but seems there is loss in durability of an item
4. Thankfully I have yet to die, but I did find this explaining death in Diablo 3 . Hardcore characters are as they were in Diablo II; mortal. One death there is the end of a character. Forever. For non-hardcore characters in Diablo III, death is a very temporary setback. Dead players can be resurrected by other players on the spot, or after a few second delay they may choose to respawn at the last checkpoint they reached. When they respawn they are wearing all of their equipment and have full health; there is no corpse to retrieve or loot as there was in Diablo 2. Characters do not lose any experience or gold upon death... As noted in their sit-down demo at E3, the developers did mention having to pay a hefty amount of gold in repairs after wiping.
5. When you die, and in a group. Each party member can resurrect you by activating your grave/remains. You can than select if to resurrect at that point, or resurrect at the last checkpoint (as stated before)*you still loose 10% durability if you are higher than level 10.
---- Gold summaries ----
1. You respawn in full health with full resources at your corpse. This is limited to a total of 3 times.

Title: Is it possible to list all of the Steam games I have downloaded?
Question: I had about ten games on Steam on my old computer. Most of them were played at least once. Now, I want them on my new computer. However, I don't care about transferring them, I just want to know what they were. Is there a function in Steam that lets me track my download history or something similar?

1. In the Steam client: 1) Click your username from the top right, then click 'Account Details', to go to your Steam store control page. 2) From the Steam store control page, under the 'Store & Purchase History' header, click 'View licenses and product key activations'. This page shows, in chronological order, what games you have acquired and how (Steam store, retail code, complimentary copy, or gift). Unlike the other methods above, this activation history includes any free games you may have previously installed, but deleted.
2. By simply installing Steam and going to the Library, there should be a list with all the games you own. If there isn't, still on the Library page there's a search function in the upper left part of the screen. From there, you can access a drop down menu where you can choose what to list. If you choose "All Games", you should see all the games you own on Steam and can redownload and reinstall whatever you want.
3. There is an additional way to view Steam games you own. After logging in to Steam you can view your account's licenses by vising this webpage: https://store.steampowered.com/account/licenses/
4. Yes, if you have access to your old computer and you haven't yet uninstalled your games/steam yet. If that's gone, I don't belive steam stores any sort of list of everything you've ever downloaded. On any PC with Steam installed you have access to a list of currently downloaded titles (it's one of the filter options on the Library page, I forget the exact menu item and I don't have Steam here). The only thing I'm aware of that you can do is manually go down this list and download the same games on the new PC (or alternately copy over the whole Steamapps folder and keep your game content and possibly saves).
5. Link: https://steamcommunity.com/id/PUT_YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/games/?tab=all Manual way: Go to your account-name, click on "show my profile", scroll down until you see "games" listed on the right side (probably above "Inventory" and "screenshots") and click it. Then select "all games" and you should see all games you've played at some point.
