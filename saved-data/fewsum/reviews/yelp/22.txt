1. Yes it 's part of a chain but the quality of the food is still excellent . The restaurant is always clean and the staff is always friendly . It 's a good place to stop for lunch .
2. Great customer service . While they got my order wrong , they really tried to make it right with a smile and as quickly as possible . The ladies working this evening were fantastic . The store was clean and the food , of course was good . Stop by and enjoy some great burgers and friendly staff ! Cheeseburger , fries and a cherry shake --- Yum !
3. Great burgers ! It definitely fills you up . You can add all kinds of ingredients like grilled mushrooms and grilled onions . Fries maybe not my favorite but it 's definitely better than in and out .
4. I 've always enjoyed five guys and this location has been good during the day time but tonight the food wasn 't as good and definitely lacked fries as well
5. Love this 5 guys , always has quick service and great food . Amazing home made fries . Not a place to go if you are allergic to peanuts , they uses peanut oil for their fries as well as they have peanuts out for people to enjoy freely .
6. The food is awesome ; the ladies that took our order , cooked and served us were delightful . Great customer service !
7. Awesome burgers . Nothing fancy here , these are for people who love the simplicity of the pure , great tasting beef . Add some basic topping if you want and grab some home made fries if you want your carbs . Always a good burger .
8. I came on a weeknight during rush hour and this place had no line . I just walked right up . Everyone was friendly and smiling and talking to you . They kept the place clean . I grabbed my order to go and the burgers were delish . I love their fries - plain fries . I don 't go for their other styles .
9. First time to Five Guys , friendly and fast service . I did not realize the food was so large . Burger and fries were great . About ten minutes from the Arizona Open Wheel Racing Museum .
