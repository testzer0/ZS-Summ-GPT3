1. Super fast service ; delivery took 10 minutes from order to front door . Good sandwiches , great price !
2. So glad they added this location to the neighborhood . It used to be a coffee shop . Now it 's a great sandwich shop . Love it ! I had the Tommy Tom unwhich and it was so tasty
3. What 's not to like about Jimmy John 's ? A great variety of tasty sandwiches filled with various meats and cheeses at a reasonable price . Clean surroundings with cool postings on their walls ! Hardly got my meal paid for and before I can walk away from the register , it 's ready ! Just as they claim , " Subs so fast you 'll freak ! "

5. Best sandwich I 've had in Vegas , can 't wait to come back ! I got the roast beef # 10 . It was amazing .
6. Anytime I order from this location they forget something . I also always ask for extra veggies and never receive them . But it 's close and convenient when I 'm too tired to cook . Plus the veggies , meat and bread are always fresh . I won 't be ordering from this location again as it has become a total waste of money .
7. skme of the best sandwhichs in Vegas . Ive been here a few times for ljnch and have really enjoyed it . I especially like the lettuce wrapped sandwhich and will be back for more
8. Ordered some sandwiches and they were awesome . Just what I needed . Our delivery guy Kylon was really nice and quick . Great customer service ! ! !
9. R people serious with there bad reviews does this look like some uppity sandwich spot . It 's simple a sandwich , chips , and drink ... sounds like perfection to me ... there for sure better then subway I 'll be honest !
