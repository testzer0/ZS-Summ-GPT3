1. Stopped here after shopping at concord mills . Ate the blue devil sandwich and tavern fries . The food was good . Would definitely eat here again if I 'm in the area .
2. I am visiting the area . I don 't like chain restaurants so this place was a great find . I had the beer can chicken . Moist and tasty . Great green beans and mash potatoes leaving one to desire seconds . Happy to have discovered !
3. Came here for lunch with my family while traveling . It was filthy and the food was salty and awful .
4. Ordered the DY Cheesesteak and Fish and Chips ... And cleaned our plates . Best cheesesteak in town . Bar none . Atmosphere and service lacked a bit , but food makes up for it .
5. First time eating here . Club sandwich is good . Fries are not my favorite but ok . Service is good . Natalie the bartender is pleasant and attentive . Will defintely be back .
6. In town for the race and we were driving around looking for lunch and happened upon this place . I had fish and chips that were great . My buddy had a barbecue sandwich and he said it was very good . It has a nice pub atmosphere and the staff was friendly and good . I would recommend it and come back again .
7. Excellent DYs cheesesteak . Best I 've ever had . I go out of my way to stop here and get the cheesesteak . The Nachos are great to order and share too , if you 're not too hungry .
8. Best wings in my neighborhood of Highland Creek . Good BBQ and great atmosphere . Try the smoke wings .
