1. It is clean and the people are friendly . Good Prices . It is convenient to where I work . Food takes a bit long , though , in my opinion . So I preorder over the phone and pick it up /
2. I 've been coming here for years . It is hard for me to get past their Cheesburger with mustard , chili and onions . Get the home fries and a bottle of Cheerwine and you can die happy .
3. The burger is really good . It 's my 3rd favorite in Rock Hill behind Legal Remedy and Flipside . The store is less than appealing . It feels very family run . If you want a good burger and it 's close , I recommend it .
4. Loved this place . Their down home feel is great . We had a hamburger , hot dog and french fries . Great chili ! ! ! ! ! !
5. Love the burgers and home cut fries ! This place is family owned and has been for over 50 years . My grandfather introduced me to Sonnys and now my kids go there .. Hard to find these kind of places anymore .. Love love love it !
6. If you 're looking for a good , cheap burger and you happen to be in town , this is the place to be ! I love the Big Ben burger here and would recommend this place to anyone ! It may be a little homely inside , but I like it !
7. Awesome fresh food ! I love this place . They even us the local delivery service which make it even better .
8. A Rock Hill landmark . No where can you find a better hotdog , fries compliment either chili dog or Carolina hamburger . Service is friendly and portions are plenty .
9. Best Burger and fries in town ! ! The fresh hand cut fries are my favorite . Friendly staff with great food . I have not had anything bad from this place , although it 's hard to order anything other than the Cheeseburger and fries . Only complaint is it takes a little long to get your food but well worth the wait ! !
