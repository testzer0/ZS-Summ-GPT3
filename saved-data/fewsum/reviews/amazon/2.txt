1. I bought for my 5 year old and she ( we ) love it . She is getting the hang of it , but it is easier for her if someone is helping her . This gadget makes making the bracelets alot easier .
2. This was too complicated for my 9 year old daughter . I tried to help her , but quickly lost my patience over the confusing instructions . This one ended up in the trash .
3. This kit is portable , compact and easy to use . I especially love how the clip and tooth parts at the top hold the floss very securely !
4. The Friendship Bracelet Maker is very easy to use . The pegs hold the floss securely and the clip at the top holds everything in place . I can make friendship bracelets much faster . I would recommend this to anyone who likes to make bracelets . Great product .
5. We have tried to make friendship bracelets before with them taped to the desk , table & books around the house in the past . This was / is so nice and portable , with additional supplies just inside the included drawer . My son loves it and can 't wait to see the fruition of his efforts .
6. the kids loved it , you can spend many hours playing with it. the threads are low quality to it function .
7. My granddaughter likes to create many crafts . This bracelet maker seemed to be an ideal gift to satisfy her ability .
8. Bought as a gift for teenager . She loves it . It 's a little complicated to get started , but once going she found it entertaining . I think regular floss will work when she needs a refill .
9. Kinda dinky . But novelty enough for a 6 year old . Wish they made more quality toys these days . I give it 8 months until its broke. at least it will teach her the concept and then she can move on to use a clip board .
