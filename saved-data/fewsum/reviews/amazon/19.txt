1. I was really disappointed that this watch fell apart after one month of having it . I had to buy another band so I could wear it . It 's not worth the money .
2. I will recommend to my friends . Quality and workmanship just fine . Very pleased with this purchase . Would not hesitate to purchase from Amazon again .
3. This item was purchased as a gift for a 12 year old . Mechanically it runs well but the very first day the spring pins holding the band on malfunctioned and I had to take it to a jeweler to have them replaced .
4. I have wanted a Mickey Mouse watch since I was a child and one of my friends had one . I am 64-years-old and now have my Mickey Mouse . I am very pleased and love wearing my watch .
5. It was a nice watch , unfortunately , the face was small for me to read so had to return it . I had bought a similar watch at WDW several years ago but the womens watch face was larger .
6. Bought these ( also the Minnie Mouse watch # MN1023 ) for my Bride for Mothers day . She is a real fan of the happiest place on earth and couldn 't be happier with these .
7. I had a black Mickey watch for years , and lost it . I really like this new one . It is petite and fun .
8. I love this watch ! I have been wanting a Mickey Mouse watch for some time and this is exactly what I was looking for . It has a very small face and fits small wrists but is very adorable ! While it is small , the time is still easy to read .
9. This was for my wife who was retiring as a teacher but not retiring from life . Now she will be a Nanny to our three grand childrenWhat better watch for taking care of grandchildren .
