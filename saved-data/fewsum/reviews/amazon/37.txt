1. After wearing for only an hour the pearls start falling off by the end of the day there were none left on the sides
2. i got these because they looked like the Chanel pearl sunglasses . These are a good alternative to those . A more affordable one . I receive many compliments on these glasses . They are true oversized eye wear , so if you do not like that beetle look these are not for you .
3. I have these shade sand have not worn them yet . I can 't think of a place that they will work , I am going to put them in my car and I will wear at the spur of the moment . These are definitely different and that is why I love them !
4. I love these glasses . The only reason I didn 't rate as high is because some of my pearls fell off . They 're really cute and eye catching though .
5. This glasses look ridiculous . I tried giving them away and I got laughed at . They look so stupid and cheap . Sorry I just hated them ! ! UGH !
6. These glasses are so cheap .... they are plastic of the cheapest kind- the pearls are huge as well as the sunglasses themselves ! The pic misrepresents these glasses .... a waist of my & $ $ $
7. in general the item 's quality and size is ok , its just that the pearls look less chic than the picture , its the quality and the color of the pearlsit would be better if the picture was more like reality
8. Amazon wants me to use a minimum number of words , but all I want to say is . Burning man ! Burning man ! Burning man ! If you want unique , these fit the bill .
9. Bigger than expected , but they for my face very well and they are super cute ! ! Can 't wait to show these off at EDC !
