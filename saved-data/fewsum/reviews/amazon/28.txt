1. The reviews were really helpful for this dress . It does run a little small so I bought it a size bigger and it fits just right . I got several compliments when I wore it ðŸ˜Š
2. I ordered this dress for a trip to Morocco because I needed something with coverage but was lightweight . As earlier reviews suggested , I ordered a size up and it fit perfectly ! Overall , very satisfied with this product !
3. I usually wear a US size 8 / 10 and this LG fits me perfectly . I love the color green and the material is great quality much better than what I buy for more money .
4. It must just run small ... it 's not really stretchy only around the chest area . I love this dress but I wish I would 've ordered a size bigger .
5. It 's not easy to find a maxi dress that provides coverage with a high neckline AND sleeves so I was excited to find this though I was cautiously optimistic about the quality & fit given the pretty affordable price . However , no regrets --- this was a GREAT buy !
6. I really like this product ! I wore it for Easter with a sweater over it . Very cute and comfy ! Can be dressy or casual .
7. I got a lot of compliments on this dress every time I wore it . The color is very soft aquamarine . The dress feels good on .
8. The color of this dress was nice . The fit was what I expected . However the material was very thin and didn 't feel like what I was expecting . I was disapointed in the way it looked on me . I loved the length but other than that I just didn 't like it . So it was returned .
9. I wasn 't sure I would like the color ... I always go for a very non colorful option . I liked the color but will need to have some shoes that will go with it better .
