1. I am new to photography , and so this seems to meet my expectations for the time being . I haven 't noticed yet if it makes a difference .
2. I give it a 4star because I haven 't had it long enough to rate higher . Looks to be all I expected .
3. it is not the same as the original of Canon . When you don 't need it you can 't remain it on the lense in the oposite side , you have to remove it totaly . This is not the one I was used to .
4. My camera is always subject to getting bumped around in my line of work . This little added protection for my lens at such a low price is a no-brainer .
5. This add on accessory helps a lot with glares and other imbalances in light that are often present in outdoor photos ! Great product !
6. Tulip lens help with sun glare - will use it any time I 'm outside and helps with night shots as well .
7. It is a great product , easy to use , just screws right on to the end of the lense . Exactly what I was looking for . Quick shipping too !
8. The cap is not holding to the lens properly and the images are getting the shaded spots .. does not fit the T5i lens
9. it is a lens hood nothing special . This is the second one I have purchased I think they help with shadows and I like the way they make the lens look I know that has nothing to do with its function but they do look nice on the lens .
