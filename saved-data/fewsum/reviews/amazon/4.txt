1. I love this watch and wear it most days . It 's very pretty . Better than the picture and it fits my small wrist
2. The Skagen watch arrived on time and was well packaged . I have bought other Skagen watches as gifts and they have always been well received .
3. The band broke after a month of moderate wear ! It was a gift given two months after purchase . Is the warranty still applicable ?
4. Very classic design . A bit disappointed because even though it said that it fits small wrists I still had to have a watch maker shorten the band at a cost of $ 25.00 .
5. The watch is the perfect size and looks very pricey.It has a snug fit and stays exactly where you put it .
6. Love the convenience of the stretch band . The steel color is not as silvery as I would have liked -- but for the price $ 67 good all purpose watch
7. I loved the strech band however it did seem to tighten as I wore it . I would like to see Skagen have more choices of watches with this kind of strech band . I sent it back because it wasn 't what I was looking for .
8. Great watch for a great price ! I get so many compliments . Shipping was fast too . Highly recommend this watch to anyone who likes a simple everyday watch .
9. To small of a face , didn 't like that . The band I really like . I found the one I wanted somewhere else
