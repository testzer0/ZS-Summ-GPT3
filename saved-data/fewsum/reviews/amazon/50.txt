1. It was difficult to find this cable at a good price . Quality good , no ghost images and fits perfectly behind my HDTV set.I recommend it to everybody .
2. I needed this to hook old emachines to new flat screen tv which had pc plug on back . It was the correct pin number and long enough to reach . It works great .
3. I have been looking for this cable for a long Time . I am very happy ! ! ! What more can I say ?
4. i had to order an adapter so it could my pc screen. i thought it was the angle that i needed but when i hooked it up it blocked other ports to my screen
5. We ordered this cable for work and it has proved to be a good buy . Very good value for the price and the right angle connection help it from disconnecting from laptop that don 't have screw connections built in for vga cables .
6. I bought this for my 40 " plasma tv . The vga input is on the side , so regular vga cables protrude out and were visible . I coupled this with a 6 ' cable and connected to a computer. it work 's just fine .
7. It works like a Charm . I am kind of xtreme with the order of my computer cables , hate the hanging cables , stuff like that , my laptop does not receive a docking so I have to buy angled wires . Thumbs up .
8. I had to run an SVGA cable from my homemade computer DVR along the side of our living room to a projector on the opposite side . Despite the length the signal quality is fantastic and the right angle connector is perfect for reducing cable strain and providing a more tidy appearance . Good signal , good quality , and good price .
9. I needed a VGA cable that would fit through a cable hole that a conventional connector would not fit through . This one went through perfectly and performs perfectly . It connects my ASUS laptop PC to our 60 " Sharp video conference TV .
