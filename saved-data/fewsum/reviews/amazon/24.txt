2. Fits great , looks great and feels great . It says that I need more words which is silly because I have said it all .
3. Looks well , fits well , & doesn 't show under clothes . Doesn 't roll down if you have a little tummy like other brands
4. I ordered a small . An got a med packing even said small glad I took them out an checked before I gift wraped them
5. I love the material and how there is something that is sewn in to keep them riding up . My only issue is that they fit a little weird , a little big but still comfortable . The material is amazing soft .
6. I love these panties , they are comfortable , well made and attractive . A good quality pair that should last a long time .
7. Love the look & the feel . Makes my day . Need to order more of these . Would recommend them . Wath more can I say .
8. I was looking forward to receiving this panty and was not disappointed . Fits well and looks great . I would definitely recommend this to others . The fit is true to size . I would like to see this product in other colors , but the basics are covered .
9. I love these panties and they fit better than i expected . Well worrh the price paid . I did not care for the matching bra because it lacked shape and form
