1. I love these pans , I was pleasantly suprised by the quality , and the color is unique and fits in the decor of my kitchen perfectly .
2. This was an additional purchase to the bigger set I purchased last year . My food cooks evenly , and the pans clean easily . The only slight negative is these pans cannot be put in the dishwasher .
3. I purchased the Paula Deen Signature Porcelain 9 and 11 inch Nonstick Skllet Set ( Aqua ) at the same time I purchased the Paula Deen Signature Porcelain 12 Piece Cookware Set ( Aqua ) . I LOVE the set . I would HIGHLY recommend it . The Speckled Aqua color is really nice too .
4. Solid construction . The porcelain finish allows the out side to be just as non-stick as the inside . I love that they are not only great for cooking , but look great if left on the stove .
5. I have many fry pans but these are the Best . Cleaning is so easy and no burn spots on finish .
6. One pan was a little wraped , but will not affect the cooking. love the color . That is all I am writing .
7. I am huge into cooking and I have bought many pans that claim they dont stick and blah blah blah . I have had these 6 months and cook all the time . These stay non stick even without using PAM , butter or Oil . I would 100 % highly recommend and even bought them as wedding gifts .
8. I luv Paula Deen cookware . I am not looking for an even larger skillet than these . Easy to take care of .
9. It is too bad that Paula is being so picked on . I bought these pans to show support for her . They are great . Non stick is top quality and construction and materials are quality .
