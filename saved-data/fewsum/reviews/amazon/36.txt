1. Correct part and reasonable price compared to other vendors . Has been working properly with our Dell Inspiron laptop without any problems for almost 2 years now .
2. Came w / o the pouch and didn 't work . Gave me credit on my credit card w no problem wish it would have worked . My old one had died after 2 yrs .
3. I have been using this Power Pack for about 2 or 3 years and it is performing as well as the Dell suupply that came with my computer . I use both in 2 different locations . It is a nice , compact unit and I like the Lighted DC Power Plug .
4. Appears to me to be a genuine Dell power supply for significantly less money than Dell charges . Works flawlessly with my Dell Studio XPS 1645 with Quad i7 . Slim and easy to pack up . I even like the little advertising bag it came with because it keeps the power supply from getting tangled up with anything else in my laptop case .
5. It took only two days between placing my order and receiving it via USPS . I ordered a new Dell laptop slim adapter and the product arrived in perfect condition . Great service . I will use them again !
6. I purchased this in July and I LOVE IT ! It charges both my batteries without problems and fits nicely into my backpack . Dell Dude has the best price !
7. Would not charge laptop all the way , only half way then stops charging , tried charging several times and did not work
8. The product works great & the company was quick & efficient ... I would most definitely purchase from them again !
9. Transaction was handled quickly.Unimpressed with the power supply . Research thru Google shows numerous complaints of users having to replace the power supply in short time frames . Doesn 't appear to be a quality design / product .
