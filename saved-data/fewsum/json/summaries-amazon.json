            "As other people mentioned the liner in these are SUPER small. I took them on vacation to Hawaii and on the second day I cut out the bottom of the liner. The waist fits fine but the liner inside is not sized accordingly. I just cut the liner at the bottom so I could be comfortable and all was well after that.",
            "great price nice style these were the best swimwear available during the winter season and compared to the others that i found online these were very sharp (style) and also the price was very decent if your son needs a pair for gym or just swimming i would recommend these to any one",
            "Shorts have a good look and feel. Fit about as expected but the mesh is a little tighter than I'd like. (6 '205lb, wear a size 34 waist and ordered the size large which is quoted to fit a 34.) If you're on the fence, might want to go a size larger.",
            "My wife said I had to buy a proper pair of swim trunks for an upcoming cruise. Seems my use of cut off jeans would embarrass her on the cruise we took. The pockets are deep enough to keep things in and the cargo pockets are good for keeping various items like sunglasses.I guess I will have to retire the cutoffs.",
            "The shorts themselves fit well, but my husband said the inner lining was a little tight. He ended up not wearing them because he was worried about them chaffing. Hopefully they can be stretched or fixed, but I'm not sure.",
            "This is a cheap product and it shows in the material and craftsmanship. The material is rough and it has one of those annoying net liners built in. The stitching seems poorly done and I don't thin it would have lasted long had I actually worn it out into the ocean. I returned the item.",
            "This was an excellent purchase - very sharp looking and seemingly well made (so far anyway) for a great price. What garners only a 4 star is the mesh inner lining is a bit too tight and i had to cut it"

The arch support is great and there is a nice give in the sole. I love these so much I want to put a few pairs away in case they discontinue them. They go with everything.",

Overall, these are highly recommended.",

            "My case arrived before the estimated delivery date and I love it so far. It was VERY easy to put on my MacBook Air. I love the retractable feet; and the color purple that came matches the picture perfectly. Would definitely repurchase something else from this brand.",
            "I ordered two of these covers after careful research and visiting retail stores. These covers were free shipping and were a snap to install. There are no issues whatsoever with them, so order them with confidence. Ignore the extra picky shoppers' reviews on here. Hope this helps.",

            "I absolutely love the case! It fits my laptop perfectly! I received many compliments on this case with the keyboard cover that came with it! I love the keyboard cover as well.

            "This iPearl laptop cover works well for Macbooks. It is easy to use on laptops and comes in a range of colors. This laptop cover is thick and offers good protection without adding weight. The fit can be a little loose on some laptops making it unhelpful as a laptop protector.  Overall, it's recommended, but with caution due to fit.",
            "This MacBook Air case looks great and fits the device well. It's very easy to install and has a functional keyboard protector. The retractable feet are useful for angling the device. Overall, the case fits most devices well and it's a high quality, sturdy case. This durable case is recommended.",

While the cover offers durable protection for the MacBook, the retractable tilt stands offer protection for the wrists. The keyboard cover can take some effort to fit properly, and adjustment to its feel may take time. However, free and fast shipping make up for this one potential issue."

            "Always consult with your doctor before purchasing any circulation product after surgery. I had ankle surgery and this product is useful for blood circulation in the foot. This increase in circulation has assisted with my ability to feel comfortable stepping down on the foot (only after doc said wait bearing was okay). I use it sitting down barefoot.",
            "I really like the Acupressure Mat. I usually toss and turn a lot when I sleep, now I use this before I go to bed and it helps relax my body so that I can sleep more sound without all the tossing and turning.",
            "I used the mat the first night after it arrived and every-other night since. After 2 ten minute sessions, I am sold. I have slept much better at night - I think it puts me in a more relaxed state, making it easier to fall asleep. A rather inexpensive option to relieving tension in my neck, upper back and shoulders.",
            "This is the best thing! you can use socks if your feet are tender to walk on it or bare foot if you can take it. I use it every morning to walk across to jump start my body. when I think about it I will lay on it, it feels wonderful.",
            "I love these spike mats and have recommended them to everyone that has had any kind of body ache. its great to lay on to relax you after a long day at work. Helps with pain in my back and pain in my legs. Its not a cure, but it sure helps with the healing process.",
            "I wish I hadn't purchased this item. I just can't get use to it, it's not comfortable. I have not seen any benefits from using it but that could be because I don't relax or use it for long enough.",
            "I run an alternative health center and use Acupressure pin mats from different sources to treat my patients, but this product is the patients choice, they are asking allways for this mat against other brands so I changed all of them for Britta, moreover the S & H was outstanding and really fast.",
            "I ordered this acupressure mat to see if it would help relieve my back pain and at first it seemed like it wasn't doing much, but once you use it for a second or third time you can feel the pain relief and it also helps you relax. I use it almost everyday now and it really helps. I recommed this product and this seller."

The mat helps with pain and pressure and is great to lay on, it is great for falling asleep on. Also it is great for blood circulation and for walking on bare feet.",
            "This acupressure mat can help ease aches and tension, increase blood circulation to extremities, and aid in general relaxation and restfulness. It can also assist in healing, as it reduces movement while sleeping. However, it takes some getting used to, and being unable to relax while using it will make it ineffective.",
            "This mat can show results if used consistently over time. It helps with relaxation, pain relief, and circulation. If the mat isn't comfortable to use barefoot, it can also be used with socks worn. If used every day, it is recommended to help greatly with tension and stress."

I found my daughter 'bridesmaid' the exact same shoe for much less. The quality is the same. the brand is the same, the look is the same and it fits perfectly.",

Remember - this is not natural leather, so don't hope to break in them. If you pick right size, they are very comfortable and cute.",

Thicker sole, better full grain leather, now they only make the black in 'grease', which stains all my socks black. Keeping them, but still disappointed in Frye.",

It is a durable and reliable product that holds up well to wear and use. While this is not a licensed Zippo product it is important to note that its fit is not guaranteed.",

The size of the flame is easily adjustable with the turn of a screw, so excess butane is not wasted based on the consumers preference. The only drawback is that it may not fit some lighter cases.",
