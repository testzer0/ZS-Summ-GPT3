My girlfriends salad was called a 'chopped salad' the lumps of lettuce were never chopped. Barely any chicken in it either. Poor experience",

My favorites are the Moroccan Turkey Wrap and the Chicken Teriyaki Protein Bowl, you won't be disappointed trying either of these.",

Good dishes mentioned were-chicken Parmesan sandwich, homemade cannoli, linguini and clams, and other sandwiches, such as Sausage and Broccoli Rabe, Pepper and Egg.",

For dessert, the cannolis can't be beat. However, the prices are on the high side for some of the portions. The staff is usually attentive and friendly, but aren't always as professional as they should be.",

It has turned into a bar more than a restaurant and are cutting corners with the food. They service has always been great! This place is hit or miss it seems depending on the night."

On the downside, the coffee is surprisingly bad, especially for being a venue that caters to breakfast. Also, there are some outdoor tables available, but they aren't dog-friendly.",

The place looked run down and looks like the workers also live there, looked really old, worn and dirty. The Tom Yum soup had the taste of spicy tomatoes. Probably look for a different place to eat another time.",

The dishes are generally lacking either in taste, quality, or simply do not meet expectations. The staff has received mixed reviews in terms of customer service. While have exhibited flexibility in accommodating customers, they can also come off as rude over the phone."

Nothing special at all about this place and wouldn't go back.",
