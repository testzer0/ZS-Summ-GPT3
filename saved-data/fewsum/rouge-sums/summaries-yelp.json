My girlfriends salad was called a 'chopped salad' the lumps of lettuce were never chopped. Barely any chicken in it either. Poor experience",

            "I've recently found this charming new restaurant although it's been around for many years. I love it. The food is really good and I just had the best service ever from Ezra. She's kind, genuine, informative, real perfection in the restaurant world. And best of all great smile! Keep up the good work chop shop!",

From the breakfast sandwiches and a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls, to the wraps and salads, and finally their protein bowls, ChopShop has it all! My favorites are the Moroccan Turkey Wrap and the Chicken Teriyaki Protein Bowl, you won't be disappointed trying either of these.",

We had the wing special and were surprised how mild their spicy wings were. Good selection of beers on draft and the service is relatively good. I would recommend for patio drinks but do dinner somewhere else.",

Not going there again, despite the fact their patio is nice. They can really make good business out of it, but they are not interested.",

Wasn't even given forks / knives with the food, and took up to 15 minutes to flag the waitress down who seemed to ignore it at first. Won't be returning to this place. Save your money and go elsewhere.",

I didn't particularly love how many veggies were thrown in with their Beijing beef (it was almost hard to find the bits of beef in the mixture), but the beef itself was very flavorful and I LOVED their potstickers!",

That, and also spicy long beans with shrimp (and / or tofu).",

I think Harkin's have the best popcorn and loyalty program. But due to the non reserved seats and recliners we aren't loyal to this theater. I want to be loyal though!",
            "My favorite theatre in the valley to go to, always clean, and the staff is usually well mannered and ready to serve. Student discount is the biggest reason I go here over AMC because Harkins is a smarter business and offers better value to any customer. I will always go here first unless I have to go to one of the other guys.",

Halfway through the movie she got tired ad wanted to go home and when the front desk saw us leave, she asked if everything was ok. We old her what happened and she gave us 2 free passes to come back again! Awesome! Clean place, great seating!",
            "Our family enjoys coming to this theatre, especially because of the on site child care. The child care staff is friendly - they just require your child to be fully potty trained. Our son watched movies, played games, and did some crafts while my wife and I enjoyed our movie in peace. Great theatre, plus good food options are in the area.",
            "Our regular theatre. Always clean and comfortable. Saw The Giver today and were 2 or 4 viewers! The staff is always helpful and nice. We appreciate the location and typically plenty of parking. We always have our souvenir cup to get a reasonable soda.",

The dishes are not your typical run-of-the-mill recipes. The sauce on the Tikka Masala, for instance, has a smokey flavor I love. The wine selection is nice too. Who knew wine paired well with Indian food?",

The toppings are like extra toppings and the crust is crisp n chewy, I've read some ppl ask fir extra sauce but I thought it was good enough, unless u like saucy pizzas. Overall really good value n pizza were ready to pick up in 15mins. Nice guys that work there too...",
            "We had the bellisima and a large pepperoni pizza. I enjoyed the zucchini in the pizza but the tomatoes made the pizza a little watery, and the cheese was a little rubbery. Other than that, I enjoyed the crust not too thick and not too thin. The pepperoni pizza was better. They delivered to our hotel and had easy online ordering.",
            "i love their pizza! I've had just a basic bacon pizza and it was so delicious. Thtey're always so friendly, and they know exactly who we are once we ask for chicken & bacon. haha Their prices are really reasonable too.",
            "This place is great. We basically selected it randomly from Yelp and they delivered right to our hotel room. The process was nice and easy and the pizza was awesome!!! Two large pizzas were very reasonably priced and plenty for a family of 6. I will definitely order from them again the next time I'm in Vegas!",

            "Meh... the pizza dough just ok, yuck sauce, good toppings and cheeses. More onions when I order 'add onions for $1'. More toppings on the actual pizza would be good. They have that 'good ranch' though! I wouldn't Order from here again, as I think there are much better options available.",
            "Great place to eat! Customer service was excellent. Did. A late night order, it arrived within the time frame given. Food was hot & as ordered. Chicken Philly, chicken fingers, double bacon cheese burger & cheese pizza was GREAT! I definitely recommend this place."
