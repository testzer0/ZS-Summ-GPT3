Summary:

The store hours should be updated online to match when the store actually closes .
No one wants to drive all the way to the store at 9 pm thinking they close at 10 pm ( because that 's what it says online ) only to find they actually close at 9 pm .
Customer service does exist for single females in a hardware store .
Today , however , we had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Diana in customer service .
Normally , our experience at Home Depot is great .
