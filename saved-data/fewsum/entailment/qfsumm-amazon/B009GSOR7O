Summary:

Size 10 is more like a size 9 but the quality of the boot is great .
The reason why I didn ' t give a 5 star is that I have worn them several times and each time the smell of the fake leather hasn ' t been worn away .
I would recommend getting one half - size higher than what you think would fit you .
I would recommend going up a half size or even a full size
I ordered these in a 9 and they were way too small - I would suggest going a 1 / 2 to a full size larger .

     [-0.7350] would have given these shoes a five star if i hadn 't been mislead by the size issue i got a size 71 / 2 because everyone seemed to think these shoes ran small but i really should have just went with my size 7 because these boots are too big now a 6 1 / 12 probably would have fit better anyway boots look good just to big
     [-0.6443] The 8.5 fits perfect !
     [-0.6443] had to order a FULL size up other than that I LOVE them .
