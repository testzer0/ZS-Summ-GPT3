Summary:

Goes through the dishwasher like a charm .
I must have 20 spatulas / scrapers of different materials , strength , sizes .
The blade is very short , stiff and very much like a knife with little flex .
I searched everywhere to find a kitchen spatula that was NOT the new stiff silicone kind , the ones that are absolutely useless when scraping a bowl .
The sizing is perfect for home use and the smaller size containers at home that the full size spatula don ' t fit into.Would buy again .
