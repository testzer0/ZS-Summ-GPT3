     [0.2642] There is a defective pulley and although they will update the pulley , the time and frustration it will cost you is not worth it .
     [0.2181] It 's a nice vacuum but the pet hair gets stuck up around the filter and you have to dig it out with a long , sharp object and it falls all over your clean rug or the kitchen floor and the vacuum itself , a MESS to clean up after !
     [0.0712] it has fallen apart each time I have used it-- the handle and attachments fall off and will not go back together .

     [-0.8800] I loved this vacuum at first until a Lego piece got sucked in and jammed the spinning brush and broke it after only a couple of months .
     [-0.8742] There is a defective pulley and although they will update the pulley , the time and frustration it will cost you is not worth it .
     [-0.8606] My favorite part is the pet little vacuum you put on the end of the hose , that sucks all the hair right off my black labs bed .
     [-0.8424] I thought that a piece of fabric caught in the roller had caused the belt to stretch and stop the roller from spinning .
     [-0.8019] I had to put a velcro strap around it.The vacuum itself is pretty good , but the two complaints above make me unhappy.Do not believe I will purchase another .
