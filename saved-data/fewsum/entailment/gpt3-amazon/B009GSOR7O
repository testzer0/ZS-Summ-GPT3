     [-0.8317] would have given these shoes a five star if i hadn 't been mislead by the size issue i got a size 71 / 2 because everyone seemed to think these shoes ran small but i really should have just went with my size 7 because these boots are too big now a 6 1 / 12 probably would have fit better anyway boots look good just to big
