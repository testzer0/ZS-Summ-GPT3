     [-0.9886] The device makes some weired noise while rotating some times scared me when I forget its existence .
     [-0.9855] However after only one day of use it started a low pitch knocking noise enough to wake me up in the middle of the night .
     [-0.9850] It also made clicking noises with every rotation .
     [-0.9807] It is working well after I purchsed it six weeks ago , but very noisy .
     [-0.9719] While winding large watches , it tends to make a " clunking " noise as the mechanism turns and scrapes the edges leaving plastic shavings on the adapter and watch .

     [-0.8222] I place two over sized sellita sw 200 watches in the winder , and they fit nice .
     [-0.8156] I love the winder since I was looking for a similar product but this one has a capacity of two watches in which will give you a free space in order if you have a second watch or planning to buy a second one
     [-0.6750] The new Diplomat ( keep in mind I had one for years ) has inserts that are much larger than before so my maatches DO NOT fit on the inserts so they can rotate and keep time .
