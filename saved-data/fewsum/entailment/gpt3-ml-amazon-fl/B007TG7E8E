     [0.8639] The low quality on this product was clear when I was unpacking it - it is obviously a cheap piece of crap
     [0.6628] I was either sold a faulty machine or this brand just simply is very very poor quality .
     [0.6362] Aside from concerns about durability , it does suck- I mean it is effective at what it is supposed to do .
     [0.4070] We had a dyson that was not doing a good job .
     [0.3650] This product is HORRIBLE .
