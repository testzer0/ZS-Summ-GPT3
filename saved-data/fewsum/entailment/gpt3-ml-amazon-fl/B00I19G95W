     [-0.8552] I couldn 't find one anywere retail .
     [-0.5435] it is too causal for my office .
     [-0.3302] This jacket is too way to big for me and I don 't like the material that it 's made of .
     [-0.3008] Order 2x and was too small was not please order a size bigger and was still to small in the arm area .
     [-0.2596] Awfully snug for a 3X jacket - I would usually wear a 2X so I played it safe by ordering the 3X so at least I can possibly wear it .
