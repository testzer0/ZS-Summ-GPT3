     [-0.7603] The buckles broke off
     [-0.7010] These came in and they are beautiful but they are too tight ...
     [-0.6905] Its like I took a bath in chemicals ...

[0.9242] The boots ran small.

     [0.9242] Too small and they were not knee high boots they stopped at the ankle .. but thanks to Amazon i was to get a full refund
     [0.6467] I had read other reviews indicating that the boots ran smaller than expected so I ordered one size larger than what I normally wear .
     [0.4556] They needed to be like a half size bigger but I have to say I love these boots I want all the colors of them
     [0.2600] Could not even zip the boot , let alone get my foot all theway in
     [0.2428] I ordered these in a 9 and they were way too small- I would suggest going a 1 / 2 to a full size larger .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.9450] So this boots were way too long , the smell was really strong when I opened the box .
     [-0.8837] They fit great and look amazing .
     [-0.8341] The fit great and are vary comfortable .
     [-0.8317] would have given these shoes a five star if i hadn 't been mislead by the size issue i got a size 71 / 2 because everyone seemed to think these shoes ran small but i really should have just went with my size 7 because these boots are too big now a 6 1 / 12 probably would have fit better anyway boots look good just to big
     [-0.7254] Super cute but I normally wear a 9 and these were too snug .

[0.9534] Order a size up.
Parent: A few people said that the boots ran small, so it might be worth ordering a size up.

Top 5 (supporting):
     [0.9534] had to order a FULL size up other than that I LOVE them .
     [0.9492] Order a whole size larger .
     [0.9456] I read the previous reviews and also recommend buying 1 size up for it to fit well .
     [0.9326] lovely boots , i like them and been getting compliments , after reading the reviews i order a size bigger , they look very nice and will be ordering another pair .
     [0.9140] Love these boots but make sure you order a full size bigger , I 'm really glad I did and they fit just as my normal size would !

[0.9923] The pleather material was a little smelly at first.
Parent: One person said that the pleather material was a little smelly at first, but it faded quickly.

Top 5 (supporting):
     [0.9923] The pleather is a little smelly at first ( kind of like gasoline ) but it fades shortly after wearing them .
     [0.3142] The reason I give it four stars instead of five is because they is a strong order when the boots arrived but the smell fades
     [0.1748] The reason why I didn 't give a 5 star is that I have worn them several times and each time the smell of the fake leather hasn 't been worn away .
     [0.1432] THere is a chemical odor that lasts more than 3 days and the toe area the boot is very hard and snug .
     [0.1154] So this boots were way too long , the smell was really strong when I opened the box .

     [0.0305] I don 't envision the pleather lasting terribly long , so try not to nik them !

     [0.0006] I 'd give it no stars ...

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.9475] I will keep them and wait for the ordor to go away and wear them without socks because they are well made and attractive .
     [-0.9468] Size 10 is more like a size 9 but the quality of the boot is great .
     [-0.9294] These are WAY better than ANY costume boot in regards to quality .
     [-0.8822] I bought for a pirate costume and they look great !
     [-0.8768] Love these !
