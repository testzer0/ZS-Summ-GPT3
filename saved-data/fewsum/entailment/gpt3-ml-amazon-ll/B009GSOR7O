     [0.6467] I had read other reviews indicating that the boots ran smaller than expected so I ordered one size larger than what I normally wear .
     [0.4556] They needed to be like a half size bigger but I have to say I love these boots I want all the colors of them
     [0.2600] Could not even zip the boot , let alone get my foot all theway in
     [0.2428] I ordered these in a 9 and they were way too small- I would suggest going a 1 / 2 to a full size larger .

     [-0.8837] They fit great and look amazing .
     [-0.8341] The fit great and are vary comfortable .
     [-0.8317] would have given these shoes a five star if i hadn 't been mislead by the size issue i got a size 71 / 2 because everyone seemed to think these shoes ran small but i really should have just went with my size 7 because these boots are too big now a 6 1 / 12 probably would have fit better anyway boots look good just to big
     [-0.7254] Super cute but I normally wear a 9 and these were too snug .

     [0.4371] The reason why I didn 't give a 5 star is that I have worn them several times and each time the smell of the fake leather hasn 't been worn away .
     [0.0194] So this boots were way too long , the smell was really strong when I opened the box .
     [0.0145] The reason I give it four stars instead of five is because they is a strong order when the boots arrived but the smell fades
