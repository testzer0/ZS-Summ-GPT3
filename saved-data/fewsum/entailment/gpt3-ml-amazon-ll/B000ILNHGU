     [0.9101] I have had two of these spatulas for under a year and have been disappointed to see the silicon has developed several large chips along the edges .
     [0.5230] Metal handle is nice , little chunks of blue silicone in food , not so much .

     [-0.9947] Handle looks very nice , and the silicone portion is a great size and perfect for scraping the bottom of the bowl .
     [-0.9945] The High temp silicone coating on it is excellent , as most spatulas will discolor or slightly burn , this one remains its original color as it was first opened
     [-0.9945] Tovolo stainless silicone line is wonderful .
     [-0.9929] These are the best spatulas--the silicone spatula part comes off the handle for easy cleaning , the handle is a nice weight and the entire thing is dishwasher safe .

[0.4538] The spoon is difficult to clean.

Top 5 (supporting):
     [0.4538] The stainless steel handles , while very attractive , give me pause when I rap them on the top of a nonstick pan to remove foodstuff stuck on the spatula--concerned about damaging the nonstick finish .
     [0.2526] I have thrown out all my old spatulas with wooden handles ( which would easily rot and weren 't dishwasher safe ! )
     [0.1605] shape makes it easy to scrape all shapes and sizes of bowls.
     [0.1297] This one is ok but cannot scrape eggs off the bottom of a pan .
     [0.1153] I was making rice crispy treats and the thin edges of this spatula broke off into the food ; had to throw this away after 1 use .
