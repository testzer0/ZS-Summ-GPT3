Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.5598] This is worthless .
     [-0.4905] The only flaw was the lack of some way to easily connect a lanyard to help keep the device easily at hand .
     [-0.4421] very slow , did not like it , dont recommend it - altough it is cheap , i do not recommend it and dont use it
     [-0.3865] There is a key ring slot but too small for any key ring .

     [0.9592] so far so good , was intolerably slow , but I reformatted the drive to fat32 from exFAT and the drive behaves like any run of the mill drive out there , just took a while to get here because it is all the way from China and it sat at a processing station there for a very long time .
     [0.9342] very slow , did not like it , dont recommend it - altough it is cheap , i do not recommend it and dont use it
     [0.7558] One works but has a very slow transfer rate .
     [0.3977] It took forever to arrive , the usb portion would not extend without breaking a piece of plastic in the mechanism , and once plugged into my computer it constantly appeared and then disappeared .
     [0.0797] took a few weeks to arrive , but i love this little flash drive.

     [-0.6666] But it doesnt fit in xbox console .. computer usage was very impressive.

     [-0.9651] very little use so far - just checked out generally and it seems to be ok. time will tell ; i will probably not trust it with irreplaceable files , but if it lasts for a year or so then excellent value for this 64gb stick !
     [-0.9539] Other than that it 's a good investment for the money .
