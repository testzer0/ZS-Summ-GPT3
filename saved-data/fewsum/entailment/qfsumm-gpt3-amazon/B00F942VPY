     [0.9507] so far so good , was intolerably slow , but I reformatted the drive to fat32 from exFAT and the drive behaves like any run of the mill drive out there , just took a while to get here because it is all the way from China and it sat at a processing station there for a very long time .
     [0.9321] very slow , did not like it , dont recommend it - altough it is cheap , i do not recommend it and dont use it
     [0.7709] One works but has a very slow transfer rate .
     [0.3071] It took forever to arrive , the usb portion would not extend without breaking a piece of plastic in the mechanism , and once plugged into my computer it constantly appeared and then disappeared .
     [0.0000] Bought 2 .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.8554] But it doesnt fit in xbox console .. computer usage was very impressive.
     [-0.7508] I am a big superhero fan and with the lighting eyes very impressed works great use about four times a week and no trouble in two months
     [-0.5508] Neat looking though .
     [-0.4199] This device was as advertised .
     [-0.4020] Other than that it 's a good investment for the money .
