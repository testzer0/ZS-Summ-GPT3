     [0.6713] The reviews were correct , this works great .
     [0.3934] No complaints , and not a bad price.I 'd recommend checking out the 25 ft cables , as they seem to be cheaper , if you don 't need the extra five feet .
     [0.3550] Awesome product , Blue-rays look fantastic , audio is perfectScrew Best Buy and the rest of them .
     [0.3315] Gold tipped connectors , great signal despite length , and the cable itself is extremely flexible and can be ran anywhere.great product , buy it !
     [0.2872] I WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE QUALITY OF MY PICTURE USING A 30 FOOT HDMI CABLE AND POWERED SPLITTER BUT I WAS AMAZED AT THE CLARITY OF THE HD PICTURE , EVEN WITH BOTH TV 'S ON AT THE SAME TIME .... TANKYOU VERY MUCH ..... EXCELLANT PRODUCT .

     [-0.9941] I tried this cable on a couple of different setups and the quality of the video / audio was very poor and the image / sound would fade in / out every few minutes .
     [-0.9926] while other HDMI cable work fine , this one stutters from PC to TV ... Horrible do not buy this cable spend you money somewheres else .
     [-0.9786] It was tolerable when it happened once or twice an hour , but now it happens every 2-5 seconds.I regret ignoring the low ratings warning me of this .
     [-0.9545] Tried it 15 different ways and it just doesn 't work .
     [-0.9542] Shipping was quick , but item did not work .. Picture was finicky in one cable and there was no signal in the other .. Maybe the ppl who say extra long hdmi cables are garbage or don 't work are correct OR maybe it 's this product .
