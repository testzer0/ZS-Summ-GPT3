[0.5435] The handle was shorter than desired.

     [0.5435] I don 't care for the handle , I wish it was a little longer .
     [0.4587] They are not your usual spatula length .
     [0.4519] I prefer a longer handle that keeps what I 'm stirring or scraping well away from my hand .
     [0.2107] But the handle is really short .
     [0.1356] The blade is very short , stiff and very much like a knife with little flex .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.8737] If you 're used to silicone , the spatulas in this line are much more rigid -- but the handle is nice and long .
     [-0.4409] The end was a little larger then I had thought ...
     [-0.2314] Exactly what I was looking for ... sturdily made , and completely sealed so liquids can 't leak in between the head and the handle .
     [-0.1495] Just the right size .
     [-0.1193] Covered in hair , fuzz , etc .
