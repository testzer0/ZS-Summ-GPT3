     [0.9006] This spatula is the greatest .
     [0.8879] Best spatula I own .
     [0.8866] This is the best spatula I have ever used , and I use it almost as much as my favorite knife ( a Henckel Santoku knife ) .
     [0.8853] This spatula has proven to be a terrific performer in many instances : sauce making , sauteing , stir frying , folding souffles and creating perfect omelets .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.9915] Horrible product .
     [-0.9909] I have had two of these spatulas for under a year and have been disappointed to see the silicon has developed several large chips along the edges .
     [-0.9837] I bought one and it soon started chipping away , disintegrating , within just a dozen or so uses .
     [-0.9822] Considering the silicon can 't withstand sauteing onions , this product has poor quality .
     [-0.9747] Chunks came off and also major " rips " in the silicone appeared rending it useless .

[0.9474] It was easy to clean.

     [0.9474] The spatula is strong yet really flexible , with a pointy side and the curved side for great versatility.The handle is comfortable and this spatula is easy to clean.Other spatulas were strong but too stiff , and too big for things like scraping out jars or getting into small spaces .
     [0.9423] Great for high heat mixing and cleans up very easily .
     [0.8127] Great spatula and cleans up easily in the dishwasher or by hand .
     [0.7137] Great shape and size , and so easy to throw in the dishwasher , unlike spatulas with wooden handles .
     [0.6852] These are the best spatulas--the silicone spatula part comes off the handle for easy cleaning , the handle is a nice weight and the entire thing is dishwasher safe .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.9960] However , I feel it 's a tiny bit stiff and makes cleaning the bowl of batter a bit more challenging .
     [-0.9902] I bought one and it soon started chipping away , disintegrating , within just a dozen or so uses .
     [-0.9887] Chunks came off and also major " rips " in the silicone appeared rending it useless .
     [-0.9846] Fishing for silicon pieces in your food is no fun !
     [-0.9837] I was making rice crispy treats and the thin edges of this spatula broke off into the food ; had to throw this away after 1 use .

Top 5 (supporting):
     [0.9424] Longer handle than other rubber spatulas , which I like .
     [0.0846] Easy to grip and long handle made it easy to get to the bottom of deep bowls .
     [0.0692] durable long handle is great and easy to manage .
     [0.0616] Had very high hopes for this , and it is nice in several ways : long handle , great shape ; but the chipping is simple unacceptable .
     [0.0325] Long handle .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.1128] Horrible product .
     [-0.1046] I would never buy these products again .
     [-0.0749] I would not recommend it .
     [-0.0721] It feels good in your hand and scrapes surfaces well but it doesn 't last long .
     [-0.0617] just like rubbermaid it withstands high heat i like that its not has heavy has the rubbermaid and is easier ti handle indoing some takes

     [0.6642] Its modernlooks go far beyond appearances ; its silicone headis both heat- and stain-resistant , unlike old-fashionedspatulas .
     [0.5407] Had no problems using it with high temperatures either , plus cleaned up well in the dishwasher .
     [0.5016] And , bizarre but true , that brushed stainless steel handle does not , in fact , conduct heat .
     [0.2954] Unless you enjoy your food seasoned with tiny bits of silicone get aRubbermaid Professional Heat Resistant Scraperinstead .

     [-0.9736] Considering the silicon can 't withstand sauteing onions , this product has poor quality .
     [-0.9583] I bought one and it soon started chipping away , disintegrating , within just a dozen or so uses .
     [-0.9575] AND if you leave it anywhere near a stove , the metal handle gets hot !
     [-0.8759] It ' very flexible , highly hear resistant .
     [-0.8010] I melted my other spatulas .
