This portable speaker system allows others to listen to the music on my iPod , I use it alot in the kitchen when I am cooking dinner so I can hear the telephone if it rings .
It is compact and keeps the iPod fully charge .
This product is great if you need a portable Ipod player .
Used a 9 - volt plug adapter to 110V and it worked great in the travel trailer .
It 's a great little gizmo for listening to music out loud on my ipod shuffle .

1. This portable speaker system allows others to listen to the music on my iPod , I use it alot in the kitchen when I am cooking dinner so I can hear the telephone if it rings . It is compact and keeps the iPod fully charge . The speakers are not the best , but they are passable.I would certainly buy it again .
2. I bought one for my son and was so happy , I bought a second one for my daughter !
3. Bought one 2 weeks ago ( early Nov ) and used it while camping . Used a 9-volt plug adapter to 110V and it worked great in the travel trailer . Sounds nice , works well , and would recommend given how inexpensive it is and my use .
4. Just as the 5 stars said . Was ready to throw away before getting but was shocked to hear great sound ! Never expected this .
5. Great sound from such small speakers . This is exactly what I was looking for . Well made and very portable .
6. This product is very well constructed . It is easy to use andeasy to take with on trips or outings . I am happy with the sound.At very high volume I have heard a little static but not enoughto be of a concern .
7. Great Product . Pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item . Very nice sound . It 's a great little gizmo for listening to music out loud on my ipod shuffle . Also acts as storage for it too . Can 't beat the price . I highly recommend it .
8. This product is great if you need a portable Ipod player . It works great in small classrooms , but in larger rooms it doesn 't go very loud . I was looking for a player that has a remote and this player doesn 't . Overall this is a good product and would recommend if it was used in smaller places .
9. I love these speakers ! ! ! It plays very loud , you can take it everywhere you go . Plus , it comes in the cutest little carrying case . This is one of the BEST purchases i 've made & the cost was fantastic ! Anyone who has the Ipod Shuffle , i strongly suggest you purchase one of these before they 're all gone .
