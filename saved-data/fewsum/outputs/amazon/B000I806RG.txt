****** Reviews ******
1. This cocktail shaker is exactly what I was looking for . The faux leather covering helps to make it easier and more comfortable to use ( no more frozen fingers . ) It is a very nice size , not too small , and can be used to mix several drinks at one time .
2. I bought this for my husband and he loves it . It does not leak and the outer covering keeps yours hands from getting cold while shaking . He really enjoys making shots with this item because they pour so easily from the built in strainer . This item is worth the price and I would say buy it .
3. This " faux leather " shaker certainly does not look " faux " . I bought this along with the metrokane VIP ice bucket and the metrokane VIP 6-piece bar tool set with caddy and they are indeed a classy looking set . Highly recommended .
4. I bought the shaker as a gift for my boyfriend . It arrived faster than I had originally anticipated and it was exactly what I wanted . I was very pleased . My boyfriend also was very pleased with it overall .
5. I returned this item once it literally fell apart after a few uses . The strainer broke free of its housing in the cap after a few vigorous shakes . Couldn 't be more cheaply made .
6. I was looking for a classy , insulated martini shaker as we have just started exploring the world of martinis and our previous shaker froze our hands everytime we tried to use it . This shaker has a sleek , modern look , and protects our hands while mixing a great drink . It 's easy to disassemble after use to pour the drink and clean .
7. i bought this for my husband who 's expanding his bar wear. the leather accent is nice but when he made his first drink and shook it with ice the strainer top bent and threatened to pop off. it 's only spot welded in a couple places , obviously now well enough attached. i bit disappointing .
8. I 've tried a variety of cocktail shakers and this is by far the best . Not only does it look elegant but it works very well . It also makes a great gift with a couple of Waterford martini glasses .
9. After using the shaker two times the top got stuck and we throw it outIt looked like a shaker we had for many years but not the same quality
