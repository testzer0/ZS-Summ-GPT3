Summary:

Great selection of games , pretty good food , lots of pool / ping pong tables and a laser shooting gallery !
The service is slow and the machine to load the games card is pretty ineffective .
It 's a decent place to play pool and arcades while having a beer .
I wouldn ' t call it a sports bar seeing as they don ' t have access to all the sports channels .
Whether you just want to visit for a quick game or spend the whole night , they 've got you covered .
