Parent: The product was as advertised, but some reviewers found flaws with it.

Top 5 (supporting):
     [0.4072] so far so good , was intolerably slow , but I reformatted the drive to fat32 from exFAT and the drive behaves like any run of the mill drive out there , just took a while to get here because it is all the way from China and it sat at a processing station there for a very long time .
     [0.2967] took a few weeks to arrive , but i love this little flash drive.
     [0.2117] very little use so far - just checked out generally and it seems to be ok. time will tell ; i will probably not trust it with irreplaceable files , but if it lasts for a year or so then excellent value for this 64gb stick !
     [0.1835] I am a big superhero fan and with the lighting eyes very impressed works great use about four times a week and no trouble in two months
     [0.1375] Other than that it 's a good investment for the money .

Top 5 (weakening):

     [-0.0001] It took forever to arrive , the usb portion would not extend without breaking a piece of plastic in the mechanism , and once plugged into my computer it constantly appeared and then disappeared .
