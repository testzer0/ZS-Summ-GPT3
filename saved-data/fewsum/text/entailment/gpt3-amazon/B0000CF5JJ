[0.8305] It is a good size for small jobs.
Parent: Some people noted that it is well-made and durable, while others found that it is a good size for small jobs.

Top 5 (supporting):
     [0.8305] It works good for small jobs , but I usually need a bigger one .
     [0.7082] I like the small scraper to use in smaller cans and jars to get all contents out as the big scraper will not go inside .
     [0.4555] This one is perfect for small jar openings .
     [0.3066] I chose this because I wanted a small spatula to get into small containers and I wanted the handle and the scraper to be one to avoid dirt getting in between them .
     [0.2923] Still I wanted a very narrow rubber spatula that can scrape out small , but tall , jelly jars , etc .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.9355] You can 't beat it for scraping out larger mixing bowls and pots .
     [-0.5946] This works ok but is a bit thick for a small spatula .
     [-0.4896] It 's unbelievably dirty .
     [-0.3561] Don 't buy .
     [-0.2109] I have worked in professional kitchens all my life and these measure up to any task .
