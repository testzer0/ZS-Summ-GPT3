     [0.2653] The device makes some weired noise while rotating some times scared me when I forget its existence .
     [0.1982] The noise sounds ghostly .
     [0.1891] While winding large watches , it tends to make a " clunking " noise as the mechanism turns and scrapes the edges leaving plastic shavings on the adapter and watch .

     [0.9194] And relative to competing products it is a very good value .
     [0.8560] serve the purpose and the price is good cos i cannot find the same in singapore .
     [0.8021] Best value for the money , it offers 3 very effective modes of operation .
     [0.7296] works quite well ; priced right ; we have had it for more than 6 mths and watches still keep same time in it
     [0.6964] A great buy .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.2610] Its nice for cheap watches only imo.Dont expect much from a winder with that price tag .
     [-0.2200] Did not work properly .
     [-0.1935] Don 't buy unless your half deaf and a really sound sleeper !
     [-0.1703] Boy was I wrong , if you have medium sized wrists , or smaller , then none of your watches will work with this winder , since the holders are too big.Look elsewhere instead of relying on the measly description from Amazon and save yourself the headache of having to return it .
     [-0.1050] But its too much of plastic .
