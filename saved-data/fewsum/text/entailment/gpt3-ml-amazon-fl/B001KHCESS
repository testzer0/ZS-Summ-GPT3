     [0.8689] The reviews were correct , this works great .
     [0.4158] Awesome product , Blue-rays look fantastic , audio is perfectScrew Best Buy and the rest of them .
     [0.3929] I WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE QUALITY OF MY PICTURE USING A 30 FOOT HDMI CABLE AND POWERED SPLITTER BUT I WAS AMAZED AT THE CLARITY OF THE HD PICTURE , EVEN WITH BOTH TV 'S ON AT THE SAME TIME .... TANKYOU VERY MUCH ..... EXCELLANT PRODUCT .
     [0.3803] No complaints whatsoever !
     [0.3461] No complaints , and not a bad price.I 'd recommend checking out the 25 ft cables , as they seem to be cheaper , if you don 't need the extra five feet .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.9935] while other HDMI cable work fine , this one stutters from PC to TV ... Horrible do not buy this cable spend you money somewheres else .
     [-0.9924] It was tolerable when it happened once or twice an hour , but now it happens every 2-5 seconds.I regret ignoring the low ratings warning me of this .
     [-0.9915] I tried this cable on a couple of different setups and the quality of the video / audio was very poor and the image / sound would fade in / out every few minutes .
     [-0.9793] VERY DISAPPOINTED ! !
     [-0.9789] This cable produced a snowed image with buzzing audio.I even used a signal amplifier ( which you shouldn 't have to use for runs under 50ft ) and it had no effect on the picture quality.Would not waste time with this product .
