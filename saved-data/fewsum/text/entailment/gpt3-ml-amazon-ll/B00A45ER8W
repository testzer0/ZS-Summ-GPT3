     [-0.5884] Did not work properly .
     [-0.4223] Boy was I wrong , if you have medium sized wrists , or smaller , then none of your watches will work with this winder , since the holders are too big.Look elsewhere instead of relying on the measly description from Amazon and save yourself the headache of having to return it .
