Summary:

I would recommend this for athletes , stay on MUCH better than KT or kinesiotape , not for thin skin elderly but great for athletes .
However , felt the elastic stretch is less than rock tape and others , so you couldn ' t vary the stretch 50 % or full stretch accurately .
Sticks very well , as well as Rocktape for water sports .
use the tape up and down my spine , helps when I have to stand up and play guitar , or work around the house , does not smell .
I 've been using KT Tape but find this to be far superior .
