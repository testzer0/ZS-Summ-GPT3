Summary:

I 'm only a size 7 shoe with medium size legs but these socks were so difficult to put on that it was hardly worth all the effort .
They are super cute , but too tight at the top of the calves .
The largest size is still too tight .
I don ' t have large calves .
I bought these because the previous compression socks with toes in them were great .
