Summary:

The Diplomat Watch Winder is attractive , quiet and works as designed .
It has 4 settings including 320 , 864 , 1080 , and 2160 TPD .
It looks OK , was the least expensive two - watch winder I found , and has worked perfectly for the couple of weeks I 've had it .
Boy was I wrong , if you have medium sized wrists , or smaller , then none of your watches will work with this winder , since the holders are too big.Look elsewhere instead of relying on the measly description from Amazon and save yourself the headache of having to return it .
If you 're not looking for " a piece of furniture " that looks like it costs hundreds of dollars , this is the product for you .
