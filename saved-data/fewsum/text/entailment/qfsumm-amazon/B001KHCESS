     [0.0726] My daughter signed up for net flix , and I wanted to view it on our 42 " Samson TV ( its not hooked up to the phone line ) so i ordered a 30 foot HDMI cable which works just fine , next I want to order a optic cable for sound then we can rock and roll.Thanks Amazon for a great product .
