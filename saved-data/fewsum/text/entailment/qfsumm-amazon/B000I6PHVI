Summary:

I don ' t like plastic product , no matter how it works .
Buttons are flimsy , and become easily stuck , as they are not a good fit with the housing .
The lid is terribly design .
But the product looks nice , and I have returned it becasue I don ' t like the material .
Does all it advertises and more have been using almost everyday and I really like to cook my meals with it , steaming chicken , broccoli and potatoes as I am writing this .
