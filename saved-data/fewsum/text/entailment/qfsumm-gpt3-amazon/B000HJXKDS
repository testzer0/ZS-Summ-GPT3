     [-0.8992] It stretches with each washing and wearing .
     [-0.8951] I was a little disappointed at the thinness of the two shirts I ordered , definitely need a camisole underneath !
     [-0.7671] The problem is that the fabric is so thin the top doesn 't hang well and it 's hard to iron to a nice finish .
     [-0.6309] The V neck was too low for me .
     [-0.6247] It runs a little large so it is baggier than I prefer but I think once it is washed it might shrink up a bit so I will keep it .
