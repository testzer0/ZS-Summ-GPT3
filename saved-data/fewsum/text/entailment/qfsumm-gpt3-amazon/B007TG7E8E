     [0.9601] I love this vacuum , it picks up tons of dust and cat and dog hair .
     [0.6754] It 's a nice vacuum but the pet hair gets stuck up around the filter and you have to dig it out with a long , sharp object and it falls all over your clean rug or the kitchen floor and the vacuum itself , a MESS to clean up after !
     [0.6734] love it , I have a German shepherd who sheds like crazy & this vacuum sucks up his hair with no problem !
     [0.5387] As the box says half price of dyson , yet more machine , I don 't know about the latter part , but I have a shepard and she sheds a lot and this thing I swear sucks the dirt and hairs from under the rug .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.9718] I thought that a piece of fabric caught in the roller had caused the belt to stretch and stop the roller from spinning .
     [-0.9165] Plastic breaks .
     [-0.9130] Waste a lot of money .

     [0.6502] it has fallen apart each time I have used it-- the handle and attachments fall off and will not go back together .
     [0.5659] Aside from concerns about durability , it does suck- I mean it is effective at what it is supposed to do .
     [0.2948] They usually break within 30 days of me using the cheap thing .
     [0.2462] It worked great but , just a hair over 3 months and it broke .
     [0.2451] We bought this vacuum and it blows the dyson away .

Top 5 (weakening):
     [-0.9914] just consumes dog hair , its super strong because of its separation and closed system of suction between the tools and the roller
