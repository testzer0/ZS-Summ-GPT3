Summary:

The reviews said that the Paula Deen Signature Porcelain 9 and 11 inch Nonstick Skllet Set is a great product. The food cooks evenly, the pans clean easily, and the porcelain finish allows the outside to be just as non-stick as the inside. The only slight negative is that the pans can not be put in the dishwasher.
