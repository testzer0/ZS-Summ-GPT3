[-0.8825607299804688] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[-0.7810096740722656] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.
[-0.7635173797607422] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).
[-0.7534942626953125] So why would I pay to use it in the room?

[-0.9981775283813477] We couldn't hear them in our room (thankfully), but they were pretty loud throughout the hotel.
[-0.9976816177368164] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[-0.9966182708740234] --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
[-0.9963412284851074] When you finally reach your room the heaters all make tremendous noise, rattle, rumble.
[-0.9959812164306641] But the rooms are a great size, and we noticed large groups of flight attendants from various airlines staying there as well.

[0.6368560791015625] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[0.594696044921875] We get the stay and jet package so we park for a week for only $30.00.

[0.3246612548828125] Granted it's a large hotel and I don't like hiking to a room in another zip code.
[0.1902923583984375] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[0.1845550537109375] One excuse was that the hotel was full and they didn't have time to serve us as customers.

[0.03346443176269531] It is an easy drive into downtown Seattle from here and worked great for my late-arriving flight before meetings in Seattle the following morning.
[0.013763427734375] Downtown Seattle was about a 30 minute ride by light rail service (cost of $16 for the 4 of us) or $40 cab ride to the pier.
[0.01061248779296875] For me the location worked well since I was attending events at the hotel and didn't have to rent a car to get there.
[0.00971221923828125] It was about fifteen minutes away from town and very close to the airport.

[0.9721260070800781] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
[0.8913116455078125] We utilized the free airport shuttle, which is handy, but did not use any other hotel service.

[-0.9326152801513672] Total rip-off with the excess charges.
[-0.9265899658203125] I was staying at the hotel for under 8 hours and yet the clerk who checked me in was still encouraging me to pay for the valet parking.
[-0.9113368988037109] So why would I pay to use it in the room?

[0.693572998046875] Food was very expensive in restaurant and just okay.
[0.6581153869628906] Food was good, but a bit overpriced.
[0.2685546875] That worked well for me since the food at the hotel is fairly pricey.
[0.135009765625] The only drawback was that the restaurant was a little on the pricey side for breakfast, but there are many places nearby to eat.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9970974922180176] Restaurant food was excellent and reasonably priced and breakfast was good.
[-0.9891963005065918] (For the discounted price) The room was very large, faced the airport, but was still quiet.
[-0.9762630462646484] At $65 plus the upgrade this was outstanding value, so much so we used it on our return journey too.
[-0.9708914756774902] We have stayed here a few times and keep coming back because it is good value for money.
[-0.9699215888977051] Booked thru hotwire and got such a great price ($69) we were worried what we'd be getting.... We were very pleasantly suprised!!

[0.9499950408935547] We had dinner in the attached restaurant, and the food was absolutely delicious.
[0.9490542411804199] We tried the hotel restaurants and the food was quite good.
[0.866363525390625] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.

[0.7059478759765625] Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax.
[0.3409423828125] On the incoming leg earlier, we stayed across the street at the Hampton for about the same price, wireless internet, free parking and free breakfast.
[0.04034423828125] They have a good stay/fly program that we always use to leave our car there while on vacation.
[0.03212738037109375] We parked our car there for a week, and were impressed with the service and rates compared with the airport.
[0.018402099609375] Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9758615493774414] The neighborhood has mostly fast-food or 'greasy-spoon' joints except for a nice looking Thai restaurant across the street.
[-0.9647159576416016] If you don't want to eat breakfast at the hotel, there is a Denny's across the street and an IHOP 2mile down the street.
[-0.9565682411193848] I suggest getting a room in the tower.
[-0.9549417495727539] I am told there are good Thai and BBQ restaurants within walking distance across the street.
[-0.9521884918212891] If you don't want to wait, a good alternative is the nearby taxi stand; fare to the Doubletree should be less than $10 because of the hotel's proximity to the airport.
