[0.7703399658203125] The hotel restaurant was nice enough, but again, bland; the food was nicely presented but had no taste.
[0.44482421875] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.4120941162109375] The room was okay, but not as clean as one would expect.
[0.3802490234375] Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out.
