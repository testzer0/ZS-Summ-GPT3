[-0.8866233825683594] I spoke with the front desk and they gave me a room as far away as possible, I did have to do a little convincing but it was no problem to be moved.
[-0.8157958984375] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[-0.80078125] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.
[-0.7769775390625] So, I can recommend the hotel, but please stay on the side where, hopefully, the base beat can't get you.

[-0.303253173828125] Unfortunately, we made the wrong decision on where to stay.
[-0.3007354736328125] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.

[0.340576171875] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!

[0.32112884521484375] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.

[-0.9958701133728027] The room was comfortable, clean and spacious and quiet.
[-0.9944429397583008] Despite this (and some of the other reviews), I found that the hotel is quiet and I was never disturbed by what is going outside.
[-0.9935474395751953] Did not hear a thing the whole time we were there.

[0.9781894683837891] The location is close to the entertainment district.
Parent: Some reviewers found the location noisy due to the proximity to the entertainment district.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9781894683837891] The hotel is very conveniently located to the nearby entertainment district, and 20 min walk to the island ferries, and is convenient to the Queen and King Streetcar lines if you wish to go further.
[0.9525051116943359] The hotel location is ideal for a visitor to the city, within easy walking distance of the entertainment district, the business district, and great shopping and dining.
[0.9463005065917969] It's right in the middle of the entertainment district which means you are near everything.
[0.9380536079406738] It is in a great location and in walking distance to all the entertainment in downtown Toronto!
[0.9313259124755859] It is located in the entertainment district, close to clubs, bars, restaurants, theater, Rogers Center and the CN Tower.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7570343017578125] Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.
[-0.6568069458007812] This place is very close to the Toronto Domino Bank office which is located in Royal Trust Tower 77 King Street West.
[-0.57183837890625] Shopping district for shoppers out there.
[-0.4201202392578125] Surrounded by lots of restaurants and two less than two blocks from great shopping.
[-0.3546943664550781] I would NOT recommend giving this hotel your business.

[0.514007568359375] Parking is convenient.
Parent: Parking was noted as being convenient, although valet-only.

----- Supporting -----

[0.514007568359375] Valets were excellent with our vehicle.
[0.44891357421875] The hotel has Valet parking only which is fine since you can walk to everything.
[0.4420623779296875] We arrived an hour early and the room wasn't available but we were able to leave our bags and have the car parked no problem.
[0.37834930419921875] I think the valet parking at the hotel is around the same amount and you can take your car in and out as needed.
[0.3733329772949219] Hotel is brand new, with valet parking, service is exeptional with extra personal touches of the staff remembering you from check in.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9899578094482422] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
[-0.9455089569091797] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[-0.9254150390625] Parking rates are high as you will find in all major cities around the world.
[-0.9216156005859375] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[-0.90289306640625] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.

[0.9851112365722656] Parking is valet only (would prefer the option to self park).
[0.9795427322387695] The hotel has Valet parking only which is fine since you can walk to everything.
[0.9113616943359375] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.
[0.7191925048828125] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.
[0.71881103515625] Some caveats: The valet parking [only option] is $35 CAD.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9883651733398438] There are lots of parking lots near by that look cheaper than the hotel valet system (one right across the road).
[-0.9722671508789062] Clearly they need more than two valet guys working on a Sunday morning when everyone is checking out for the weekend There was a party going on at 1-2AM beside one of our rooms.
[-0.9719581604003906] There was an ipod dock in the room which was nice to have.
[-0.9719219207763672] Donâ€™t take the limo to the airport.
[-0.9701662063598633] But the best thing was the staff!

[0.982785701751709] Location was fantastic.
[0.9695010185241699] The location was excellent, right across the street really from Theatres and Second City Comedy club.
[0.9664134979248047] The location was wonderful, a stones throw from King Street which is the entertainment district area.
[0.9663295745849609] The location is great, the hotel itself is fairly new so everything was clean and nicely presented.
[0.9439458847045898] GOOD: Location is awesome!!!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.94854736328125] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.
[-0.8826885223388672] Try not to get a room on that side, even high up.
[-0.8420791625976562] Unfortunately, we made the wrong decision on where to stay.
[-0.7458610534667969] This is where the weekend turns for the worse....
[-0.7349929809570312] Ridiculous!

[0.1708984375] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.
[0.13611507415771484] Great location and a short walk to much of Toronto's sights.
[0.10969161987304688] Other Comments: the location is not too far from some great downtown clubs.
[0.041393280029296875] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.025056838989257812] The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the location was very convenient to a lot of major attractions downtown.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8153095245361328] Some reviewers had mentioned the noise from the clubs so we asked for a quiet room and were not disappointed.
[-0.6589736938476562] OK, I love music, but this was no music !
[-0.6444873809814453] Never heard back.
[-0.5893898010253906] It was an adjustable bed that allows you to choose the softness, I found it to be lumpy and uncomfortable.
[-0.58843994140625] That was a bit of a pain, but understandable, because it was getting extremely rowdy and it was clear people were bringing in about 10 people into one room.
