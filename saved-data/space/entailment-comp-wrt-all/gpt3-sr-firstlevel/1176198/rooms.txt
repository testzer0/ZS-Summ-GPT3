[0.7596321105957031] I have stayed at this Hilton Garden on Peter street on business many, many times-so when planning a weekend visit with the family I had no hesitation to book- Its well situated, clean and modern and generally a very good value and the Hhnonors perks are good- WOW what a difference during the weekend-instead of business folk and tourists-its packed with club kids and partyers-the staff do their best-but its noisy and the area around the hotel is pretty crazy late in the evening on weekends- I will stay again during the week-but never on a weekend

[-0.8664054870605469] It is convenient to a nearby Shopper's Drug Mart (to pick up some in room snacks) and a large LCBO with a rather big Vintages section for some excellent wine for the room.
