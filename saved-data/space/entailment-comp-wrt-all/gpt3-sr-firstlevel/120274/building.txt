[0.7960205078125] Hotel does supply free shuttle buses to all theme parks which go every day and you don't have to bye your tickets from the guest services at the front of the hotel happy holidays.
[0.782623291015625] The hotel offers free shuttle bus to the theme parks also, but the bus departs from the hotel at 8:40a.m.
[0.71051025390625] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.

[0.7645492553710938] THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.
[0.7557907104492188] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.
[0.7418251037597656] It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!
