[0.0769195556640625] to those folks who complain so bitterly about this hotel... perhaps try the fairmont and pay several times what you paid.
[0.0638580322265625] I don't feel our two friends enjoyed the stay as much as we did.
[0.0532073974609375] At check out the couple ahead of me had a bad experience with the management but the young fellow at the desk handled it with such grace that I wanted to applaud him.
[0.03183746337890625] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.0194854736328125] Nothing in the room felt clean and I agree with one reviewer that the bed "crunched".
