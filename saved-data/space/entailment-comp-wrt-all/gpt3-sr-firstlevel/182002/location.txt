Parent: The only downside is the cost of parking, which at $23 a day, is expensive compared to other cities.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9101762771606445] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.8309860229492188] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[0.7668476104736328] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.6201019287109375] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.5923614501953125] The price was amazing ($90 CAD) and parking was typical at $23/day/in & out privileges.
