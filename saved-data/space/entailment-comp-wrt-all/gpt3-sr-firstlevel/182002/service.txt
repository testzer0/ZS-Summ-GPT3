[0.3461265563964844] They also didn't all have the same procedures.
[0.1779022216796875] Despite our best efforts to convey how irreplaceable it was, housekeeping claimed not to have seen it.
[0.138031005859375] They weren't that friendly.
[0.1153717041015625] In my entire life, I have never been treated in such a rude, disrespecting manner.
[0.11074066162109375] Considering that a lot of rooms are let out to students, it was pretty quiet.

[-0.9153480529785156] The group in general was pleased with the rooms.
[-0.8801231384277344] It was full when I got there and had to get a "pass" to park in the employees parking lot in the back alley!
[-0.8504791259765625] There were several `ladies of indeterminate occupation` on duty outside the front door most of the day & night.
[-0.8441982269287109] We picked a non smoking room with two double beds.There are several restaurants in this area.
[-0.7994575500488281] There are a lot of students there so it made the elevators very slow at meal times.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7689018249511719] None of the 'perks' of the hotel were available-pool, steam room, gym, and the TV was old and hardly worked.
[0.6569442749023438] The hotel however seems to be ageing with the air con unit making a loud grinding noise and shower water sometimes talking hours to drain from the bath tub due to a blockage.
[0.6284599304199219] The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service.
[0.5869731903076172] The rooms are old, the bathroom smelled, we had a view of air conditioners and the gym was a joke.

[-0.9958105087280273] The front desk staff were very unfriendly and always seemed to make matters overly complicated.

Parent: The reviews were mixed, with some people finding the staff to be friendly and helpful, and others finding them to be rude and unhelpful.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9477977752685547] Overall, not perfect but good value for money.
[0.9457206726074219] The biggest disappointments were: -Elevators (being "updated", bumpy ride, not reliable-ended up on a floor we didn't know we could access!)
[0.8970470428466797] 1) Rude staff at the front desk (only one of the employees we dealt with were nice); 2) Restaurant only open part of the time; 3) They DID give us a bigger and cheaper parking space out behind the building because our SUV wouldn't fit in the underground parking, but there were junkies hanging around at that parking lot; 3) FOUND A BEDBUG IN THE BATHROOM SINK (ALIVE) -- 'NUFF SAID!
[0.8749179840087891] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.8446559906005859] A few very minor complaints - the bathroom was very small and a bit cold, since the only heat was from a small baseboard heater.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8345050811767578] We all really enjoyed our stay, and hope that sometime in the future, we will be able to return to Toronto and explore the city more since we really didnâ€™t get much time to look around.
[-0.8217811584472656] All the staff I encountered were friendly and couldn't have been more helpful, which I found very reassuring as a lone female traveller on her first trip to Canada.
[-0.8074150085449219] We were very pleased with the service and the meeting space.
[-0.8027381896972656] We had an absolutely fabulous time.

[0.258575439453125] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
