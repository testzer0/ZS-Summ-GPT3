[0.9446172714233398] See if you can get upgraded to a higher floor room, the view is really spectacular!
[0.9389681816101074] They provided me a room with a great view, and my room was very clean and equipped appropriately.

[-0.8360786437988281] The Hotel is good - the location is not.
[-0.777069091796875] The location is less than optimal - the northern edge of Downtown.
[-0.7406139373779297] Really abusive.
[-0.7113313674926758] this is the worst joint ever.
[-0.6375389099121094] It was NOT good.

**********

[0.252838134765625] The location is not suitable for families.
Parent: The location was noted for its great view, but it was also noted that it might not be suitable for families due to the drive inn restaurant across the street.

[0.252838134765625] Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.
[0.16037750244140625] Too many hobos and drug addicts!!!
[0.073272705078125] It tool almost 30 min to make some food an no one else was there other than the homeless people that kept asking to get their cup refilled for them.
[0.04669189453125] The location is not that good for the regular tourist with no car but a Metromover station is nearby.
[0.0403289794921875] Unless you have a rental car, you're at the mercy of taxis to find an interesting neighborhood since this one is so bland.

[-0.9771404266357422] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!
[-0.9689216613769531] As we arrived we parked on the street, there was constructiono but being that we live on Sobe we knew the area and parking area well...so we avoided the $29 valet parking per day....We were greeted by Andrew, excellent front desk person who gave us a room on the high floor....I told him it was my birthday weekend and he tried to make it very special for me and my family...we then went to lobby to wait for room, excellent service also...The service at every place we went was superb...i even thought i wasn't in Miami...lol..everyone super friendly....the pool bartender also....In the executive lounge, service was great too...nothing to complaint....our room had a great view of the port and bayside also miami beach and the bed was amazing.......
[-0.9675674438476562] Within 5 minutes of arriving, three different employees greeted and welcomed our family .
[-0.9395980834960938] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[-0.934450626373291] My two daughters and I stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise.
