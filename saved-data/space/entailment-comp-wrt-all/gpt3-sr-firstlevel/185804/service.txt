[-0.996335506439209] The desk staff would not look up on Hotels.ca the discrepancies we sited when checking out but they were very cheery and smiling the whole time while denying our information which was infuriating!

[0.041290283203125] Although the hotel has parking for a daily fee, it is best not to bring your car as the island is definitely best seen on foot and driving on the island is difficult as pedestrians are everywhere.
[0.01836395263671875] Its a much better way to see the island.
[0.012905120849609375] If you want to walk/cycle - it doesn't get better the the walking/cycling trails leading away from Granville Island.
[0.01071929931640625] It's even better in the early morning, before all of the people arrive for the day, when you feel you have the place to yourself.

[-0.9507904052734375] If you want to visit downtown just take the water taxi or "aqua bus" these little boats are fun, not very expensive and the quickest way to gt there.
[-0.9100522994995117] Hop on a nearby ferry to explore downtown, the West End, Yaletown or Chinatown.
[-0.9039125442504883] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
