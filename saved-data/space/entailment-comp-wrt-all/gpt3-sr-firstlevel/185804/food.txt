[0.96337890625] The in room breakfast was exceptional and reasonably priced as were the items in the mini-bar.
[0.6042461395263672] We stayed overnight in one of the rooms which was on the small side, but beautiful views and excellent room service for breakfast the following morning.
[0.2565021514892578] Most everything else about the hotel was great as well - the size of our room, the friendly staff, a great dinner and breakfast, again with outstanding views from the dining room.
[0.06625747680664062] The room service was great!
[0.054595947265625] The restuarant in the hotel is quite nice and despite its "brewery" designation is much more of a full menu than you might expect.

[-0.9490299224853516] Didn't try the breakfast we we tended to buy things from the market and eat them outside.
[-0.8560009002685547] so that when we bought food to bring back to the room, we had nothing to eat it with.
[-0.8422641754150391] We were told none were available.
[-0.7589225769042969] The event I attended had a lunch and reception in the restaurant and the food was fantastic.
[-0.7083740234375] Our evening snack on the patio was delicious, relaxing and we had a lovely server...again most helpful and obliging...and the view!

[0.9493389129638672] Food isnt great but you are right by the market.
[0.93377685546875] The hotel restaurant was fine, not great.
[0.9275684356689453] For old times sake, we even had lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory, but the food wasn't very good, so we decided to give the city a miss and pootle around the Island instead .
[0.825286865234375] The food is acceptable, but don't expect gourmet.
[0.8110008239746094] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.

[0.9628362655639648] Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market.
[0.9244165420532227] The hotel is not far from the Aqua Bus, taxis, and the Granville Island Public Market making it easy to get around.
[0.9085044860839844] The best part of the hotel is being able to walk to the Public Market where you can find everything you need to prepare a wonderful meal (like a picnic with wine, cheese, bread, fruits, meats, etc) or you could just eat at the many food stalls.
[0.8956108093261719] The biggest obivious attraction of this hotel is its location - smack dab in the middle of Granville Island, and therefore close to the restaurants, markets, shops, and galleries that are all nearby.
[0.8031234741210938] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.

[-0.8873672485351562] The hotel is located right on the water.
[-0.842254638671875] The hotel is located as close to the water as you can get without falling in.
[-0.7469482421875] Being on the sea wall makes it safe and impossible to get lost.
[-0.7425346374511719] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.5151405334472656] Its perfect to be near the water and located in one of the greatest areas in Vancouver.
