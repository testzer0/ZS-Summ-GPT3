[0.9354610443115234] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.9258079528808594] It was huge, comfortable ,clean, nicely decorated and with great views over the boats of False Creek.
[0.8317985534667969] The hotel was well appointed, our room comfortable and decorated in a traditional style.
[0.7553176879882812] All the rooms have been remodeled with nice big screen TVs, very comfortable beds and nice décor.

[-0.9370269775390625] The rooms are small and sparsely furnished.
[-0.7901344299316406] Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel.
[-0.587982177734375] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.497406005859375] Our only real disappontment was when we walked around Gastown, which really seems to have got shabby since our last visit.
[-0.4545440673828125] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.

[-0.824859619140625] Initially they were less than courteous about it but i said if there is a charge of course i would play however it might be helpful for future guests to be escorted to the bike and given a brief safety instruction prior to giving someone a key.
