[0.8046875] The best part of the hotel is being able to walk to the Public Market where you can find everything you need to prepare a wonderful meal (like a picnic with wine, cheese, bread, fruits, meats, etc) or you could just eat at the many food stalls.

[-0.9959564208984375] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.9865617752075195] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
[-0.9735183715820312] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
