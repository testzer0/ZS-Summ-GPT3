[0.11041641235351562] I hesitate to start with a description of a not-so-good experience, but the staff response to the not-so-good experience was handled so well that in the end, I left the hotel quite impressed.

[-0.9288520812988281] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[-0.9197349548339844] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.9017691612243652] When we arrived at the hotel, there was nobody available to get our bags.
[-0.8827972412109375] other issues- bathroom really not that nice, concierge horrible at recommending things to do or good resutarants or giving directions.
