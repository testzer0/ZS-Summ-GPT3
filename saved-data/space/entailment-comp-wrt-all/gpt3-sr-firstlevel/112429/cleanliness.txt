[-0.39019775390625] Only downside is the charge for parking, $27 a night, but that is now standard, if not low, for parking in Seattle.
[-0.36175537109375] Their tone of voice was no better than a 13 year old with a bad attitude!
[-0.351287841796875] Pine Street is much easier to walk down to the Market than some of the other downtown streets (less incline.)
[-0.344573974609375] Some other restaurants in the area within two blocks (Vons, Cheesecake factory).

[0.4696617126464844] The best included the cleanliness, the attention to detail with lighting and electrical outlets, the comfortable furniture, the robes, the great shower, the refrigerator, the windows can open, the wide and well lit hallways (although too warm) and of course an excellent king bed.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9852867126464844] The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit.
[-0.9787893295288086] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.9624900817871094] The room is shabby, the shower made a horrible noise whenever the water was running.
[-0.9538378715515137] Don't take a room on the inside unless you want to be awakened by the garbage trucks at 5am.
[-0.9283733367919922] They just seem unsanitary to me.
