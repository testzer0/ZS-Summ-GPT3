[0.949223518371582] The pros: - Convenient the location, walking distance to Pike Place Market (8 short blocks) and Bell Town.
[0.9310464859008789] The hotel is conveniently located, has a helpful and friendly staff, and is within walking distance to PPM, Capitol Hill, Belltown, and the Space Needle.
[0.9307675361633301] It is close to everything and it was convenient to walk everywhere.
[0.8908443450927734] The hotel is a perfect location -- a block from the Seattle Convention Center/Conference Center, which was very convenient.

[-0.9880161285400391] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.9006919860839844] I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.
[-0.8294334411621094] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.
[-0.8214263916015625] Valet parking was terrible.
[-0.8175563812255859] The only thing I didn't care for was the fitness center, which was sort of a dungeon in the basement.
