[0.232208251953125] Generally, when we stay at a downtown Seattle hotel, we are happy to be getting back to our own homes and beds, but with Paramount, we were sorry we didn't have a few more days.
[0.11059951782226562] The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.
[0.09785842895507812] While it wasn't a bad room, and we would consider the hotel again if we were going to a concert, it certainly wasn't anything memorable.
[0.08733367919921875] Things I don't love about the Paramount: The view isn't much --- the rooms look toward other high-rise buildings.

[0.6182727813720703] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
[0.5599536895751953] I wish we would've not rented a car and took the train from the airport.
[0.556269645690918] The room service order-taker and delivery person were both very nice and professional, but it would be wonderful to have a wider range of menu options to select from.

[0.2375335693359375] was back at this hotel after a couple years and I would like to point out that Jerry who is the reservation or front desk manager has been a welcome constant at this hotel, made my reservation through him and was also checked in as well by him.
