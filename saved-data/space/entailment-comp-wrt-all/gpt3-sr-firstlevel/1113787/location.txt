[0.9677467346191406] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[0.2700233459472656] It might be where the young people of Texas go to spend their money on dinner and drinks in the bar but its not the place to stay overnight.
[0.18889617919921875] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.274566650390625] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.

[0.8833198547363281] We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel restaurant Charlie Palmers and it was excellent.
[0.7108955383300781] It is clear this hotel has no loading dock or alley because while I was eating dinner at the award winning restaurant downstairs (Charlie Palmer's) I had big trucks pulling up within 10 ft of my table loading and unloading big crates of towels (I learned they outsource their linens) and other large pieces of equipment.
[0.6915531158447266] We ate breakfest downstairs at Charlie Palmer which was one of the best hotel breakfest experiences I have ever had.

[0.9721364974975586] The pool is great, it has great night life, and the rooms and beds are great!
[0.9682464599609375] The pool (or Poule as they call it) is as nice as any you will find, glass on the end which extends out at 10 stories high.
[0.9672079086303711] The pool is amazing and the restaurant cuisine is outstanding.
[0.9648170471191406] The Joule has a modern feel kind of like the W but it is warmer feeling and more comforatble than the W. The pool at the Joule is amazing and is actually where they film the outdoor bar scenes for ABC's The Deep End which is the show is set in LA but is actually filmed in Dallas.
[0.9623985290527344] This is an excellent hotel with an amazing rooftop pool and lounge area.
