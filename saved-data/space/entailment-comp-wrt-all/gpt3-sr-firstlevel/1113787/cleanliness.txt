[0.977849006652832] The hotel was clean.
Parent: The reviews said that the hotel was clean and well maintained, although the maids need to dust the bathroom lights.

----- Supporting -----

[0.977849006652832] I would recommend this hotel to anyone; it is clean, luxurious and has out of this world service.
[0.9744148254394531] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
[0.8958053588867188] The hotel is gorgeous and our room was clean, modern, and just as I expected a Luxury Starwood Hotel should be.
[0.8287506103515625] I felt like we were in a clean and futuristic hotel.
[0.7447509765625] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9903755187988281] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[-0.9859371185302734] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.983607292175293] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.9741744995117188] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.9623889923095703] It needs to be removed ASAP.

[0.7445335388183594] The accomodations were wonderful, the canti-levered pool was gorgeous and the lobby ultra chiq...but the best attribute by far was the care and attention to detail given by Henry and the valet staff!
[0.6798095703125] The hotel is gorgeous and our room was clean, modern, and just as I expected a Luxury Starwood Hotel should be.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9580402374267578] It was insulting that the doorman/management were so disrespectful and unwilling to take care of their guest.
[-0.9525699615478516] Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an "upscale" hotel.
[-0.9398460388183594] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.9323043823242188] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.

[-0.9965357780456543] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.

[-0.5439834594726562] I was so livid with how it was being handled that I was ready to completely lose it.
[-0.39948272705078125] Well it started off BAD within 10 mins we had went to the pool where we find about 5 young ladies workin and just stood there looking like we where not even there, so I was like excuse me can I get a drink.
