[0.6900482177734375] Admittedly the open bathroom concept may not suit a lot of people so be aware â€¢ Food â€“ Charlie Palmer is a very very good restaurant.
[0.5638694763183594] I stopped into Charlie Palmer for dinner, had a fantastic time there, Tommy the bartender took great care of me and the food was out of this world.

[-0.9642009735107422] Charlie Palmer cooks the room service menu but it is different menu than restaurant and didn't look as good (no foie gras).
[-0.9071063995361328] I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.
[-0.9048080444335938] Since the squid and quail eggs on their menu did not sound good, one of our group walked across the street to order some Food and bring it over.
[-0.8862113952636719] Furthermore, room service was closed at 10 pm, front desk was unhelpful (in ordering a pizza nonetheless) and Charlie Palmer was a waste of time and energy (great staff, HORRIBLE management.)
