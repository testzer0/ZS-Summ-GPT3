[-0.9820060729980469] The rooms where pretty standard and had very comfortable beds.
[-0.9589805603027344] we were so tired and sore from bad sleep we went home early on monday without shopping or anything the room was kind of plain we had the room with a jacuzzi and fireplace but both nights when we were in bed sleeping the jacuzzi mysteriously turned on and woke us both up and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off.

[-0.94854736328125] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9974465370178223] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
[-0.996922492980957] I would not stay her again because of the rude front desk staff and the street noise.
[-0.9964680671691895] They told us in a very rude tone and with attitude that our credit card had been declined over the last few days and that they had tried it several time so we would have to provide a cash deposit.

[0.32012939453125] For some this may not be an issue, but also be aware, most rooms do not have bathtubs, just standup showers, so if you like to bath or have children who you need to bath, this is likely not the best choice.
[0.27154541015625] Pool and hot tub clean, though bizarrly no changing room.

[-0.9806709289550781] Back down at the desk we were offered a portable cot "free of charge".
[-0.9805145263671875] ROOM: this room was big, with a big bed and couch (pullout).
[-0.9732666015625] Beds were adjustable to firmness and the chairs in the rooms are awsome!
[-0.9720649719238281] The bed was so comfortable that we fell right to sleep and never noticed any noise from the club.
[-0.9710292816162109] It was an adjustable bed that allows you to choose the softness, I found it to be lumpy and uncomfortable.
