[0.9474811553955078] The Hilton is a good choice for business travelers.
Parent: Overall, reviewers thought the Hilton was fine for business travelers, with a great location near the airport and port.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9474811553955078] Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler.
[0.7977142333984375] I travel about every week for business and stay in the Hilton/Hilton chain for the points and usually my stays are fine there.
[0.646514892578125] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[0.37261962890625] This hotel is best suited for the folks who want a decent place to stay when working in downtown Miami or are going to catch a cruise.
[0.2095794677734375] The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun.

[-0.9594573974609375] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace
[-0.922119140625] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.
[-0.7728900909423828] The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace.
[-0.687774658203125] Too many hobos and drug addicts!!!
[-0.5989151000976562] It tool almost 30 min to make some food an no one else was there other than the homeless people that kept asking to get their cup refilled for them.

[0.7342720031738281] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.

[0.9608650207519531] The rates were very high.
Parent: However, some found the rates to be very high, especially for breakfast, and felt that the hotel was not suitable for a holiday stay.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9608650207519531] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
[0.80096435546875] $28/day for valet and $25/day self parking...very expensive Blood stains on pillow cases...contacted front desk about the issue and they reacted like it was a normal thing and would mention it to housekeeping.
[0.7976474761962891] I was skeptical of the quality because of the great rates.
[0.7686347961425781] Cold fat soaked bacon, processed meats, and very expensive.
[0.690887451171875] We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9933919906616211] Rate are cheap, but breakfast was not included and hotel charges $20 for breakfast buffet.
[-0.9926509857177734] The restaurant inside the hotel had delicious plates and the breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and delicious.
[-0.9915766716003418] The executive lounge also had a nice view and offered hot and cold appetizers, water and soft drinks, along with wine and beer for a reasonable price.
[-0.9903464317321777] We had a small group and received a decent price for the weekend.
[-0.9860773086547852] You'll see the signs - much, much less expensive.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9585342407226562] The breakfast buffet is expensive but worth it.
[0.5465087890625] Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.
[0.504119873046875] To further my aggravation, the hotel information stated that a continental breakfast buffet was included, however when we went down the dining area and got the kids some food and sat down to eat is when we were informed that the breakfast was not included, since we were already sitting and eating it was a little too late to get up and leave, add another $60 to the bill and my deal is now no deal.
[0.23809814453125] The breakfast buffet was quiet nice.

[0.8816452026367188] Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing.

[0.8179874420166016] I feel the housekeeping staff is totaly at fault, and needs better supervision.
[0.557708740234375] Our room could have been better, candy wrappers in the dresser drawers and a pair on men's underwear crumpled up by the picture window.
[0.521484375] Valet service is god awful.
