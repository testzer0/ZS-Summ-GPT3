[0.6016387939453125] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace
[0.4152202606201172] Excellent services clean and spacious rooms with great view of downtown Miami.Bar off lobby is a great hotel bar.We were given a bottle of champagne for our anniversary.The staff was very accommodating always smiling and engaging in conversation.
[0.11273956298828125] That having been said that have updated the rooms and the corner Jr. Suite is very spacious, had a great view of the bay but lacked a microwave or a mini-refrigerator???
[0.07065200805664062] This is a very large hotel and very busy with many international guest (we overheard many languages spoken) and eventhough the staff was VERY busy they all had a great attitude and friendly demeanor.

[0.06170654296875] Being downtown the hotel is a bit lacking in local amenities.
[0.0550384521484375] However the Hotel has an old feel to it and the surrounding areas outside the hotel was a bit rundown and had a grimy feel.
[0.029605865478515625] You may stayed at other modern hotels around the world and you will find it this hotel is a little bit dated.

[0.80303955078125] The elevator can take 20-30 minutes to get to your floor and is often filled with people and luggage.
[0.7816524505615234] A huge group of teenagers were staying in the hotel, and kids were all over the place until late at night...flooding the lobby, elevators, and public space.
[0.7643289566040039] We finally got to the lobby and due to the many marathon guests, it was busy.
[0.7633495330810547] Bar service at busy times was a little haphazard - incorrect orders although they did make amends for errors.
[0.7486724853515625] Pool area although at roof level and could be quite a haven staff appeared once again overwhelmed at busy times - could not keep on top of towel demand and allowed guests to bring bottles/glasses into the pool area.

[-0.33026123046875] The only drawback is that near by the hotel you do not have any life, and the park option is expensive 28 usd.
