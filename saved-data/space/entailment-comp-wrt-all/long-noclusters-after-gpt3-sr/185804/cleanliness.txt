[0.8809051513671875] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.

[-0.9720687866210938] It is a mash up of 80s smoked glass and more recent upgrades and pseudo renovations.
[-0.9700984954833984] The room also had a weird smell.
[-0.9693946838378906] Oh, and the sauna was broken.
[-0.9666872024536133] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.
[-0.9661273956298828] Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling.

[-0.9679527282714844] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
[-0.9490184783935547] Oh, and the sauna was broken.
[-0.9240531921386719] They need to update the place, but since it is the only hotel on Granville Island I think they are in no rush!
[-0.9163780212402344] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.7909889221191406] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.
