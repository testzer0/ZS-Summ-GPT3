[0.394287109375] The food was amzing, the room service food is from the restaurant downstairs!!
[0.338104248046875] However, Shawn at the bar, Scott the restaurant's executive chef, and Todd at the hotel bar have MORE than made up for the rough start.
[0.295867919921875] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[0.24715423583984375] Since the squid and quail eggs on their menu did not sound good, one of our group walked across the street to order some Food and bring it over.
[0.200103759765625] Charlie Palmer cooks the room service menu but it is different menu than restaurant and didn't look as good (no foie gras).
