[-0.9977154731750488] For business use the hotel gets a C, it was a poor service compared to the others.
[-0.9976458549499512] We are NOT demanding restaurant a patrons, but both the food and the service was poor.
[-0.9957208633422852] I was disappointed with the Internet service, though: $15 + $3 service charge daily, from noon to noon, with some interruptions.
[-0.9932036399841309] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.9928174018859863] The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all".

[0.6371269226074219] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!
[0.6092567443847656] The people at the front desk were more than willing to help us out with what we needed.
[0.5863418579101562] And David and Paul the Concierges were very knowledgable and nothing was too much trouble..

----- Weakening -----

[-0.996833324432373] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.

[-0.9939165115356445] When my husband's Cesar salad was served with chicken instead of salmon, he had to hunt down the waiter to point out the problem, and the waiter barely seemed to care.
[-0.9932570457458496] Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff.

Parent: There were some issues with the phone system in some of the rooms, but the staff was very helpful in getting them resolved.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9897713661193848] The issue I had is that the phone system in some of the rooms was not functioning when I checked in.
[0.8793764114379883] I tried to hook up my computer to the internet in the room afterwards, but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue.
[0.1777210235595703] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
[0.094818115234375] A few minutes later this person came to my room and handed me a key to another room that happened to have its line fixed already for that night.
[0.08480453491210938] I was happy to get this hotel for $159/night - though internet was slow and added $16 dollars per day (though it included all calls - or so i thought until i got my bill and they had charged me $40 worth of long distance calls - they were promptly removed).

----- Weakening -----

[-0.16339111328125] Friday AM I had surgery.
[-0.12520599365234375] Also had a problem with the shower - very hot...but not an issue.
[-0.11148834228515625] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[-0.097930908203125] When my husband's Cesar salad was served with chicken instead of salmon, he had to hunt down the waiter to point out the problem, and the waiter barely seemed to care.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9763698577880859] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
[-0.966461181640625] While the beds were comfy and we had plenty of room, the guest rooms are in need of a renovation.

[0.9162616729736328] Everything was as expected, good check in, great location, nice room, good staff, etc....then about 11:00pm the fire alarms went off.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9780845642089844] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.
[-0.9764938354492188] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
