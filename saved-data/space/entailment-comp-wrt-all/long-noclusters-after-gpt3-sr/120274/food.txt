[0.16996479034423828] I would highly recommend a trip to the Rainforest Cafe in Downtown Disney, Hardrock Cafe in Universal, Bennigans on I drive and Johnny Rockets at the Pointe they are all brilliant!!
[0.04868316650390625] Breakfast was better than i have had in any other American hotel and the staff were always helpful and cheerful.
[0.0323333740234375] The breakfast was better than other free breakfasts served at other motel like hotels in florida.
[0.02166748046875] Free breakfast - waffles , cereal , good muffins , tea coffee , juices.
[0.019195556640625] Often all the tables would be full and the bread was often finished before the breakfast session finished.

[-0.9773101806640625] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[-0.9728078842163086] Their "continental breakfast" was stale white bread and cornflakes.
[-0.9681863784790039] I wouldnt even call it a breakfast buffet.. there was toast or some skanky cereal or make your own waffle.. which tasted vile.

[0.8386955261230469] The location was a bit far from Universal Studios.
Parent: The location was a little out of the way for Universal, but it was only 5 minutes from Disney.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8386955261230469] The location is a little out the way for Universal, Prime Outlets (formerly Beltz), I Drive etc but it's only 5 minutes from Disney, you can see the top of Expedition Everest from the car park at the back!!
[0.070587158203125] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.0487060546875] Very limited tv channels, but the room is only used for sleeping... you have to visit the Theme Parks when in Orlando.
[0.0306396484375] Don't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney!
[0.017749786376953125] You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.

[-0.9727916717529297] its close to everything if you drive to orlando this is the spot and make sure to get your park tickets next shopping center over from the hotel where the dragon is you cant miss it universal only 60.00 bucks a 30.00 savings, i love the 3rd night free and the pool is heated and feels great in may at night .
[-0.9386215209960938] Two double beds which were great because it was HOT so got a nice big bed to ourselves to keep cool (then a cuddle in the morning hehe) Good bathroom, good staff, good pool, TV with lots of channels and a free digital safe...... Good location on the 192 at the end so nice and quiet (with a mega short cut to animal kingdom if anyone wants to know it mail me) right near all the good buffet restaurants, close to disney and a short drive to universal.
[-0.8992500305175781] The hotel is only 5 mins away from the attrattions which was excellent.
[-0.8951034545898438] check in was fast & friendly,location is close to shopping,10 min from disney,15 min from universal & seaworld,1 hr from daytona & cape kennedy.
[-0.88311767578125] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....

[0.712646484375] An excellent budget motel, better than many in this area.
[0.6168594360351562] This is passably the best deal in the WDW area I have been to WDW over 50 times staying everywhere from the Grand Floridian to the Gator Motel this is the best deal I have found the rooms were clean (they even steam cleaned the carpets mid week) we had a view of Expedition Everest from our room the housekeeping staff was thorough and friendly as well as the front desk attendants the continental breakfast was no more than doughnuts some muffins and toast juice, milk and coffee I was traveling with a 1 and a 3 year old and didn't have to worry about them crawling on the floor
[0.48095703125] We booked with first choice and this seems to be there most budget hotel.............if you want better you'll have to pay for it i suppose, We wanted a cheap base to enjoy the local attractions but with that we also got a nice comfortable hotel room in a nice quiet area and everything was fineeeeeeeee.

[0.424163818359375] (Tell driver to take the Sherbeth Road short cut) Breakfast is fine for a few pieces of toast and orange juice- if you want an all-you-can-eat buffet there's a Sizzler and Ponderosa across the road about 10mins away on foot.
[0.049407958984375] On a better note... the hotel is in a good location and just down the road is a cafe thing where you can get an all you can eat buffet breakfast for very cheap, which served loads of fruit, cakes, a fry up, pretty much anything.

[-0.9930896759033203] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
