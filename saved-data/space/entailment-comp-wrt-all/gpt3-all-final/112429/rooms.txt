[-0.9974188804626465] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !

[-0.8115978240966797] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.795196533203125] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
[-0.650146484375] The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.

[0.529388427734375] The rooms were too small.
Parent: Some reviewers found the rooms small, but most found them adequate.

----- Supporting -----

[0.529388427734375] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[0.1392974853515625] They did provide us with roll-away beds but then there was no room to move around in the room.
[0.111083984375] The bathroom is the size of a closet and the hot water took forever to warm up.
[0.0074558258056640625] This is a small place and they react quickly.

----- Supporting -----

[0.360107421875] One had wobbly paddles and the other one squeaked when you paddle.
[0.28997230529785156] We ate there very late one night and there was a good crowd and the place was very lively.
[0.2688751220703125] The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review all the way around is that we could hear the person in the next room peeing.
[0.2669830322265625] My only minor complaint is some noise from the plumbing, also from the street and from an adjacent building's hvac system.
[0.24535369873046875] On this last stay, I was assigned a corner room which had great views but, because of having two windows and being on the corner of a busy street, was also a bit noisier (sirens, etc.)

----- Weakening -----

[-0.714935302734375] The other fellow named Rich was very aloof , didnt know anything and confusing.
[-0.6675014495849609] Laid back, nonintrusive hotel suitable for business or vacation stays, centrally located on Pine--3 blocks from Westlake, a block from the bus terminal ($2.75 airport transfers), and a block from Von's Martini and Manhattan Shrine, never to be missed.
[-0.6640777587890625] Everything from the staff to the amenities everything.
[-0.5891342163085938] Front desk personnel are somewhat "aloof".
[-0.5170707702636719] Everyone was very friendly, and eager to pass on maps, coupons and recommendations for the local area.

[-0.9955682754516602] Needless to say we left the hotel very frustrated and upset.
[-0.9844875335693359] Things started to go terribly wrong on our second night.
[-0.9792823791503906] I did not enjoy my stay here.

[-0.9618759155273438] I stayed for 5 nights and by the 5th night I was dreadfully ill.
