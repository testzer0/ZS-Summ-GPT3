[-0.9975252151489258] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.9415664672851562] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.9361915588378906] Things I don't love about the Paramount: The view isn't much --- the rooms look toward other high-rise buildings.
[-0.9349842071533203] Valet parking was terrible.
[-0.933110237121582] Ok, it is bad.

[-0.8749828338623047] Our aim was to get away for a few days, do some shopping and have a few good meals.
[-0.8537921905517578] This is a small place and they react quickly.

[0.8608369827270508] The location was pretty good, we could walk to almost all the downtown sites we wanted to see.

[-0.5364856719970703] Sounded like a jackhammer.
[-0.5258407592773438] It was fun to watch all the concert goers before and after the concert - and not to have to worry about parking or showing up early.
[-0.5083713531494141] That's abit scary to see.
[-0.4831047058105469] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.

[0.5883102416992188] The hotel is noisy.
Parent: The only downside mentioned by some was that it can be a bit noisy due to its central location.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5883102416992188] The restaurant (Dragonfish) has amazing food, and a wonderful happy hour small plates menu, though it can get quite busy, the hostess just took our room number and called us when our reservation was ready.
[0.2421875] We enjoyed the bustle and excitement of this area of downtown, and we have no complaints about the room or cleanliness or service or noise.
[0.22437572479248047] We ate there very late one night and there was a good crowd and the place was very lively.
[0.18475341796875] On this last stay, I was assigned a corner room which had great views but, because of having two windows and being on the corner of a busy street, was also a bit noisier (sirens, etc.)
[0.153411865234375] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
