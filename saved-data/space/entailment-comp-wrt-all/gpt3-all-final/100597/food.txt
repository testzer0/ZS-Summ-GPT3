[0.8807640075683594] Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.
[0.790252685546875] The hotel restaurant was nice enough, but again, bland; the food was nicely presented but had no taste.
[0.7448253631591797] Lovely spacious Doubletree, with gift shop and a very good restaurant inside it.
