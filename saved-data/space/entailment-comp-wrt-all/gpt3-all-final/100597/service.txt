[-0.9241628646850586] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
[-0.8963279724121094] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.

[0.9530057907104492] It's a solid 3* hotel and good value.
[0.8817977905273438] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.

[0.8451728820800781] Very big, spread out hotel with very reasonable rates and nice rooms, although some are a bit of a convoluted walk from reception.
