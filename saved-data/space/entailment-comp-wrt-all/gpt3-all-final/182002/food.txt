[0.1259765625] The food at the Primrose Hotel was okay.
Parent: The food at the Primrose Hotel was mixed, with some people enjoying it and others not.

----- Supporting -----

[0.1259765625] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
[0.063232421875] The one good thing that came about from our stays at this hotel was finding The Golden Greek Restaurant which is in the lower part of the building next door.
[0.041141510009765625] The restaurant buffet for breakfast was good, the wait staff was very pleasant.
[0.0391387939453125] We are huge fans of their breakfast menu but there were only a few choices available- very few muffins and bagels.
[0.03717803955078125] I did have breakfast in the morning in the restaurant beside the lobby area and was pleased with the level of service from the waiter and while he did make a small mistake on my order (he gave me potatoes when I asked for no potatoes), it was quickly rectified, and he continued to provide attentive service.
