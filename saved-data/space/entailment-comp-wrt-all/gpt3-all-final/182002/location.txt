[0.9720029830932617] We have never been to Canada before or to a huge city like Toronto, we found it very easy to get around, Primrose hotel is an excellent location as the subway is only 5min walk way .There is a lot of restaurants , bars, stores ,drugmarts and shops within walking distance also Dundas sq , Eaton centre &hockey Hall of Fame are close by.
[0.8345317840576172] I stayed at the Primrose for ten days and I did like the beds as well as the location of the hotel.
[0.5561103820800781] We stayed in Toronto at the Primrose hotel which was great cuz it was right downtown.

[-0.9565773010253906] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.
[-0.948918342590332] It is very worn and in a terrible area of town.
[-0.8262252807617188] I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump.
[-0.7246513366699219] We arrived at 3:00 in the morning, and drove through the night to arrive to the filthiest hotel we have ever seen!
[-0.699798583984375] The underground parking is horribly laid out.

[0.10315704345703125] I do not recomemnd taking the elevators in the morning if you are only a few flights from the main floor because people are sardined in the elevator please take the stairs.
[0.0893096923828125] The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out.
[0.0798492431640625] We we awoken with the sound of drills and banging which was not good.
[0.052490234375] We didnâ€™t realize that the Primrose Best Western hotel was in the middle of a large prostitution area, until we left and noticed the building was surrounded by dozens of prostitutes.
[0.0431060791015625] It may be cheaper than other hotels, but the abuse you experience is not worth it.
