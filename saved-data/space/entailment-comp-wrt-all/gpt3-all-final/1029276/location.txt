[0.7175827026367188] Anyway if you have a car it takes 3 minutes to go to South Beach and it is better spend money for a good hotel in downtown compared to a fake design hotel in SOBE.

[0.5740852355957031] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.
[0.5521697998046875] The location was good, very close to the Bayside area and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach.

[-0.890533447265625] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[-0.8655261993408203] The location is less than optimal - the northern edge of Downtown.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9088783264160156] The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in.
[0.4608726501464844] Downtown did not feel safe at all, and there were alot of unsavoury looks as we did walk 4 blocks from the Hotel.
[0.3390483856201172] Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.
[0.28968238830566406] Regardless of what you are told it is not safe for anyone.
[0.20364761352539062] Not only did the three of us feel unsafe but we were scared to stay in the room for fear the guard might have access to our room.
