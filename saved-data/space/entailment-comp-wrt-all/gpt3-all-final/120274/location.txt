[0.9301815032958984] On a better note... the hotel is in a good location and just down the road is a cafe thing where you can get an all you can eat buffet breakfast for very cheap, which served loads of fruit, cakes, a fry up, pretty much anything.
[0.929020881652832] Fantastic location wit restaurants, gift shops etc all within walking distance of the hotel (I did the whole thing on foot as I don't drive).

[0.28302764892578125] The location was Hazardous.
Parent: Some reviewers found the location to be Hazardous because you have to make a u-turn to get to Disney.

[0.28302764892578125] THE UGLY....Unsafe exposed electrical wiring, Loud drunken kids on both weekends, No sercurity.
[0.2569427490234375] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.2291545867919922] I did not feel safe here at all.
[0.225677490234375] The pool was not user friendly... the bugs carried you away.
[0.2096405029296875] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.

[0.2576904296875] Don't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney!
