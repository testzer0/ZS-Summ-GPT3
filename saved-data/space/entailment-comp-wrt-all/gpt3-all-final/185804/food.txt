[-0.5751533508300781] For old times sake, we even had lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory, but the food wasn't very good, so we decided to give the city a miss and pootle around the Island instead .

[0.3045196533203125] The Big Bus hop onhop off goes fairly close to the hotel (5-7 min walk) Live Music played most nights from Restaurant which while very good when you have a full day and want to sleep it would go until about midnight.
