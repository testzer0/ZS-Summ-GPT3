[-0.9599251747131348] Our room was on the ground floor, and I was initially worried it might be noisy as it had a view of the waiter's water station for the outside patio, but in fact it was very quiet, and we could glimpse the water through the shrubs which preserved our privacy, as well as people-watching.
[-0.9542040824890137] Granville Island is a wonderful oasis of calm right in the middle of Vancouver, there are shops, restaurants and sights all around.

[0.6808433532714844] I thought the penthouse was well worth the money for a romantic stay compared to the other hotels we considered.
[0.213531494140625] quiet at night without the often ugly street level scene you encounter at more glamorous high-rises (yes the high-rises can give you great views but coming out at street level you feel like you've walked into a seedy bus station environment).
[0.07672119140625] Got room twice the sz with a balcony & view - MUCH better :-) This is close to everything,GR8 4 kids, couples, walking, hopping, coffee, food, farmer's market, easy acess to bridges, residential, ferries across water to downtown, yaletown, science world.

[-0.4853057861328125] While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
[-0.4726104736328125] But the main high-light for us, as we are sick of being in our cars in Los Angeles, was the public transportation.
[-0.45188140869140625] I would not recommend this to my friends or family.
