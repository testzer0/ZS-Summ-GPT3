[0.259033203125] I loved the bathroom set up and the shower was huge, big enough for 4 couples (if you're into that sort of thing).
[0.25006103515625] if i had to nit pick i would say that a couple of lights switches and one of the phones did not work (ironic for a restored electric building) but in all honesty none of those defects affected our stay, which is probably why no one bothered to report them before; having said that a hotel of this stature should probably have better quality control so i still deducted one star from my rating.
[0.1960601806640625] It was very crowded, you could barely move, but the drinks were very good.
[0.18505859375] Our tweens loved the salt water heated infinity pool, the Charlie Palmer bar, awesome room service and gorgeous room......we live in Carrollton, but felt we had traveled to another luxurious country!
[0.158447265625] We stayed in a deluxe room.

[-0.9878711700439453] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9852104187011719] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[-0.9844131469726562] 2 - We stayed in the Demi-Joule room and it was very small.
[-0.965576171875] Although the room we were in was a bit small, they had really nice decor and details that you would not see a Marriott or a Hilton, IMHO.
[-0.796600341796875] I had a wonderful stay at the hotel, loved the rooms, even though our room was a bit small they utilized the space very well.

[-0.9928874969482422] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.9925374984741211] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[-0.9916391372680664] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.965087890625] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.

[0.8074874877929688] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
[0.7439117431640625] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.
[0.398773193359375] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[0.302734375] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.

[0.2172698974609375] I opened my curtains to a view of the construction site.
[0.0589752197265625] We went out for dinner and then straight to sleep, then left early in morning bc construction noise woke us up, so we didn't have time to eat anything from mini bar.
[0.0262451171875] I suggest you take a look at the managment position as the pool ran out of Chardoney on Saturday night before 10pm and no one offered to go get us some more.
[0.0] The pool!

[-0.9472990036010742] It is close to AA arena so you can catch a lot of great events.
[-0.9363384246826172] From it's convenient location to the Dallas business hub for guests, to the captivating style of the hotel, to the impeccable service, this was the perfect place for my event.

[-0.9068565368652344] Puts you in the heart of Dallas close to great dining, nightlife, shopping and culture.
[-0.8948688507080078] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
