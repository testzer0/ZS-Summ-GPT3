[0.977849006652832] The hotel was clean.
Parent: The reviewers said that the hotel was very clean and well maintained.

[0.977849006652832] I would recommend this hotel to anyone; it is clean, luxurious and has out of this world service.
[0.9744148254394531] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
[0.8958053588867188] The hotel is gorgeous and our room was clean, modern, and just as I expected a Luxury Starwood Hotel should be.
[0.8287506103515625] I felt like we were in a clean and futuristic hotel.
[0.7447509765625] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9903755187988281] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[-0.9859371185302734] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.983607292175293] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.9741744995117188] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.9623889923095703] It needs to be removed ASAP.

[0.7445335388183594] The accomodations were wonderful, the canti-levered pool was gorgeous and the lobby ultra chiq...but the best attribute by far was the care and attention to detail given by Henry and the valet staff!

[-0.9580402374267578] It was insulting that the doorman/management were so disrespectful and unwilling to take care of their guest.
[-0.9525699615478516] Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an "upscale" hotel.
[-0.9398460388183594] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.9323043823242188] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
