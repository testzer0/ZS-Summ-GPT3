Parent: The location of the hotel is praised by reviewers for its cleanliness, luxury, and excellent service.

[0.97161865234375] The hotel is in a nice location with good access to some great restaurants.
[0.8827934265136719] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[0.8637313842773438] From it's convenient location to the Dallas business hub for guests, to the captivating style of the hotel, to the impeccable service, this was the perfect place for my event.
[0.8161706924438477] This is an excellent hotel with an amazing rooftop pool and lounge area.
[0.7010898590087891] If you are headed to Dallas this is a great hotel in a great city.

[-0.9573554992675781] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[-0.9486026763916016] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[-0.7964210510253906] Not great if you're trying to sleep in.
[-0.7930564880371094] This hotel has a very cramped feel.

[0.7132186889648438] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
[0.6070709228515625] I would recommend this hotel to anyone; it is clean, luxurious and has out of this world service.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9612350463867188] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[-0.9522666931152344] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.8993988037109375] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.89459228515625] It needs to be removed ASAP.
[-0.8044700622558594] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.

[0.9709920883178711] The service at the hotel was not good.
Parent: Some reviewers did note that there were some service issues at the hotel, but that the new GM is working to turn things around.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9709920883178711] ok Saturday we ate at Charlie Palmers resturant in hotel food was good but service was so bad I could get better service at MC Donalds than this supper bad.
[0.9499073028564453] Absolutely ridiculous service for any hotel let alone one u pay $300+ a night for.
[0.9485969543457031] Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an "upscale" hotel.
[0.7714157104492188] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.7345390319824219] to get ONE sandwhich I had to call and ck on it and there are slow and the service is so bad and the managers know which makes it WORSE...

[-0.9940662384033203] From the time we drove up to the Valet at the hotel and were greeted by the amazing staff until we left the hotel the experience was one that I will never forget.
[-0.9939098358154297] The decor, overall atmosphere, and excellent service in this hotel exceeds expectation.
[-0.9938993453979492] From the minute I pulled into the hotel, it was nothing but first class service and a professional knowledgable staff.

[0.07645416259765625] Their new GM is aware of the service issues they have had and he is working to turn it around.
[0.0697021484375] the romance package is worth the upgrade because it includes champagne, valet parking, chocolates and breakfast, and they even cover the bed with rose petals if/when you leave the room after check-in.
[0.05407142639160156] Whoever is the GM is doing an amazing job with their staff!
[0.0519256591796875] The warm, modern feel of the hotel is a big hit with our guests!
