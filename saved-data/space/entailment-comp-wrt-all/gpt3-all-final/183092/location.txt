[0.9479684829711914] Stayed for three nights as a family, couldn't be more central for all the downtown attractions, everything's within walking distance and the hotel is connected by a walkway to the Eaton Centre.
[0.9015693664550781] The Downtown Marriot is good for exploring the city since everything is within walking distance (if you do not mind to walk a bit across a city which I think is the best way to get the vibe of a city).

[0.865692138671875] I had not been to Toronto for years and didn't realize how walkable most of the central city is, especially from this hotel, which is conveniently located just blocks from culture, food, shopping and transportation.

[0.0326995849609375] On each occasion I paid about $175 Canadian/night for the room (wouldn't pay a lot more for it).If shopping is not a top priority, there are probably more convenient locations for tourists to stay, but if you want to do some serious shopping, this is the place to stay.
[0.003917694091796875] Its a pretty cool thing to be able to walk right into torontos biggest mall in just two minutes.
