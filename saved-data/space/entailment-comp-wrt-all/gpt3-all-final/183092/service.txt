[-0.9977188110351562] For business use the hotel gets a C, it was a poor service compared to the others.
[-0.9951438903808594] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.993680477142334] other issues- bathroom really not that nice, concierge horrible at recommending things to do or good resutarants or giving directions.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9955720901489258] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.
[-0.9866170883178711] My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.
[-0.9856195449829102] The worst part of the stay however was finding two LARGE insects or animals, something in the room!
[-0.9855070114135742] We called reception at 3am to get them changed, they were apologetic and changed them immediately but even the 'new' sheets still had holes and looked worn!
[-0.9795284271240234] I was on the 10th floor, it took forever for the shower to get hot and when it did the temperature fluctuated radically from luke warm to scalding.

[0.808349609375] Breakfast was reasonable but unremarkable and the service very hit and miss.
[0.7597808837890625] Room service breakfast was $20 for nothing too special.
[0.478515625] There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.
[0.11575698852539062] Poor QC here.
[0.0564422607421875] I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.
