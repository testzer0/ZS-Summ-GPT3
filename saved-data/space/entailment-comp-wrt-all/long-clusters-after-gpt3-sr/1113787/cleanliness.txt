Parent: The reviews generally said that the hotel was clean and well-maintained.

[0.977849006652832] I would recommend this hotel to anyone; it is clean, luxurious and has out of this world service.
[0.9744148254394531] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
[0.8958053588867188] The hotel is gorgeous and our room was clean, modern, and just as I expected a Luxury Starwood Hotel should be.
[0.8287506103515625] I felt like we were in a clean and futuristic hotel.
[0.7447509765625] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9903755187988281] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[-0.9859371185302734] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.983607292175293] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.9741744995117188] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.9623889923095703] It needs to be removed ASAP.

[0.5968379974365234] The accomodations were wonderful, the canti-levered pool was gorgeous and the lobby ultra chiq...but the best attribute by far was the care and attention to detail given by Henry and the valet staff!
[0.4306011199951172] All of the details from the lobby theme and decor to the functional and modern bathrooms have been impeccably taken care of.

[-0.9671630859375] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.9550209045410156] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[-0.9548130035400391] It was insulting that the doorman/management were so disrespectful and unwilling to take care of their guest.
[-0.9546470642089844] The gym is in desperate need of an upgrade.
[-0.9516878128051758] Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an "upscale" hotel.

[-0.9028396606445312] At first, I did not want to eat at the restaurant.
[-0.8996219635009766] The convenient location of The Joule allowed us to choose from a variety of restaurants.
[-0.8953971862792969] You must try their signature desserts, the peanut butter bar...YUM!
[-0.8949546813964844] Want a wine glass?
[-0.8931217193603516] We ate at the restaurant before we were going to go out and the food was amazing and the service was second to none.
