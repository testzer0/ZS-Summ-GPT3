[0.2025146484375] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.196044921875] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
