[0.9667773246765137] The hotel is in a nice location with good access to some great restaurants.
[0.8200693130493164] From it's convenient location to the Dallas business hub for guests, to the captivating style of the hotel, to the impeccable service, this was the perfect place for my event.
[0.8169174194335938] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[0.6456298828125] If you are headed to Dallas this is a great hotel in a great city.
[0.5919075012207031] The convenient location of The Joule allowed us to choose from a variety of restaurants.

[-0.7969818115234375] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[-0.6271438598632812] I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.
[-0.6239547729492188] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[-0.622283935546875] (Apparently we weren't the only guests to have their evening botched by this hotel).
[-0.6197128295898438] It needs to be removed ASAP.

[0.9378180503845215] the hotel has an excellent in house restaurant with plenty on the menu and delectable choices.
[0.8441362380981445] Everything from room service from the top Charlie Palmer restaurant in the hotel 24/7, plus the stunning gorgeous pool, amazing rooms, etc, etc.
[0.7889919281005859] It is clear this hotel has no loading dock or alley because while I was eating dinner at the award winning restaurant downstairs (Charlie Palmer's) I had big trucks pulling up within 10 ft of my table loading and unloading big crates of towels (I learned they outsource their linens) and other large pieces of equipment.

[-0.61517333984375] I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.
[-0.52142333984375] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[-0.42482566833496094] Maybe I just had a bad experience but I was throughly disappointed in this hotel.
[-0.3850059509277344] All in all, this hotel was nothing special with a high price tag.

[0.8389549255371094] The hotel is too cramped.
Parent: However, it is also in a somewhat cramped area with a loading dock at the front of the building.

[0.8389549255371094] This hotel has a very cramped feel.
[0.80145263671875] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.

[0.014072418212890625] I would never hesitate to return to this hotel.
[0.0136566162109375] It might be where the young people of Texas go to spend their money on dinner and drinks in the bar but its not the place to stay overnight.

[-0.998211145401001] The warm, modern feel of the hotel is a big hit with our guests!
[-0.9977538585662842] From the lobby to the rooms, this hotel has been very tastefully decorated â€¢ Rooms â€“ Very chic rooms.
[-0.9977049827575684] I would recommend this hotel to anyone; it is clean, luxurious and has out of this world service.
[-0.9976804256439209] The accomodations were wonderful, the canti-levered pool was gorgeous and the lobby ultra chiq...but the best attribute by far was the care and attention to detail given by Henry and the valet staff!
