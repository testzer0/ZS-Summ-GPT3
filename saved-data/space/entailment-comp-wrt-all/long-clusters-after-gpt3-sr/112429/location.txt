[-0.986760139465332] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.9484291076660156] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.9398841857910156] Things I don't love about the Paramount: The view isn't much --- the rooms look toward other high-rise buildings.
[-0.8424825668334961] Ok, it is bad.
[-0.8104667663574219] PLEASE don't give this awful chain your business!

[0.7941741943359375] On this last stay, I was assigned a corner room which had great views but, because of having two windows and being on the corner of a busy street, was also a bit noisier (sirens, etc.)
