[0.5516891479492188] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
[0.48688507080078125] We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied.
[0.4755363464355469] We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac.
[0.4376983642578125] Despite the low rate, the receptionist tried to give us the type of room I wanted (high floor, one bed) and was very pleasant to me.
[0.42945098876953125] Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport.

[-0.9960727691650391] I'm surprised at the negative reviews, I'm a regular Priceline customer, staying at the Doubletree usually once a month and have never had a bad experience.
[-0.994720458984375] The shuttle was hot and smelly again and people were mad.
[-0.9879288673400879] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.9835071563720703] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[-0.97930908203125] To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.

[0.6174545288085938] Anyway, I requested a non-smoking room but the floor smelled like the stench of smoke.
[0.5394935607910156] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
