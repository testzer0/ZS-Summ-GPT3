[0.9519233703613281] If you don't want to wait, a good alternative is the nearby taxi stand; fare to the Doubletree should be less than $10 because of the hotel's proximity to the airport.
[0.9479742050170898] The hotel is pretty big but the location next to the airport is great.

[0.9680652618408203] Very nice hotel, very close to the airport, walkable in fact to the terminals in less than 10 minutes or one can take a free shuttle bus.
[0.9639120101928711] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
[0.8986663818359375] We utilized the free airport shuttle, which is handy, but did not use any other hotel service.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9394588470458984] Total rip-off with the excess charges.
[-0.9370384216308594] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[-0.9112415313720703] I was staying at the hotel for under 8 hours and yet the clerk who checked me in was still encouraging me to pay for the valet parking.
[-0.8965167999267578] So why would I pay to use it in the room?
[-0.8669881820678711] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.

[0.359588623046875] I didn't have a car so Airport, Light Rail and many restaurants are in walking distance.
[0.1572265625] You could safely cross the street at the light and crosswalk and find your self at a diner or several other restaurants.

[0.06423759460449219] It seemed to ALWAYS be running, and was very convenient.

[0.3466339111328125] We purchased the Park and Fly Package and were very happy to discover that this package included valet parking for our car directly out front of the hotel, not off in a back parking lot or at an off site location like many other hotels.

[-0.948699951171875] I arrived late at night and was flustered by the confusing and poorly lit parking options.
[-0.9478750228881836] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
[-0.9408187866210938] When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that.
[-0.9376616477966309] Getting to the room was a fun adventure in itself.
[-0.9283771514892578] Be sure to have your receipt for parking from the front desk (i did thanks to previous posts) or you won't be able to get your car.

[0.052280426025390625] Rooms are not particularly posh or large.

[-0.9850673675537109] The room was quiet, very comfy beds and we enjoyed the view from the 10th floor; the room and hallways could use an update, but are perfectly adequate.
[-0.9836158752441406] Also nice view of some trees out the balcony.

[0.7399177551269531] The views of the airplanes taking off was great!
[0.7308807373046875] Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed watching airplanes takeoff and land, and this hotel provides an eagle's eye view of the airport (unless you're on the east side of the tower, in which case you're stuck looking at the snowcapped Cascades and/or Mt Rainier).
[0.5496978759765625] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.38954925537109375] Great location within view or shuttle ride from the airport.
[0.22005748748779297] I asked for a room in the tower and the room was spacious with a nice king bed and a balcony that overlooked the airport.
