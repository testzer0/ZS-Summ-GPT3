[0.9786958694458008] Room was very sub-standard for cleanliness...floor looked like it never gets vacuumed.
[0.9755921363830566] They also did an extremely lousy job in cleaning the room.
[0.9348506927490234] Don't really need this on holiday especially when you have been out really early say on an excursion and you return late afternoon/early evening to find room not cleaned or replenished.
[0.9169654846191406] One or two issues during our stay included :- Housekeeping - at least 2 days out of the 5 our room was not made up and we had to chase housekeeping.
[0.8728485107421875] The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
