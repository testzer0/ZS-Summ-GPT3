[0.9712333679199219] Parking was an issue.
Parent: They also said that parking was an issue and that the nightclub next door could be loud.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9712333679199219] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
[0.9423913955688477] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[0.874755859375] The room was great, the only issues we had was with Valet parking and having a room at the front of the hotel.
[0.7894058227539062] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[0.6864852905273438] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.

[0.9163494110107422] The nightclub next door is too loud.
Parent: They also said that parking was an issue and that the nightclub next door could be loud.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9163494110107422] Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.
[0.7737579345703125] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.
[0.603271484375] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.
[0.47942352294921875] The obnoxious discobar downstairs next door !
