[0.9092941284179688] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.
[0.88958740234375] THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.
[0.2232513427734375] Pool area cleaned daily again basic could do with some new furniture have to cross small parking lot to access, towels available daily from reception minimal charge.
