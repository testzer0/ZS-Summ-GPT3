[0.8472747802734375] Take my advise and eat the hotels simple continental breakfast and save yourself a headache :) The hotel was overall GOOD with friendly staff...
[0.7896060943603516] All in all, this is the perfect hotel if you are intending to visit the parks every day and just have somewhere to rest your head at night.
[0.7728900909423828] We booked with first choice and this seems to be there most budget hotel.............if you want better you'll have to pay for it i suppose, We wanted a cheap base to enjoy the local attractions but with that we also got a nice comfortable hotel room in a nice quiet area and everything was fineeeeeeeee.
[0.7625656127929688] If you want a cheap, comfortable and clean motel as a base to visit Disney and Universal this is first class.
[0.7040557861328125] It was cleaned everyday, the safe was free (bonus) and the beds were the most comfortablist (?)

[-0.9719057083129883] Bottom line - do yourself a favor: NEVER STAY at this flea bag of a hotel.
[-0.9242038726806641] I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!
[-0.8941802978515625] AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!
[-0.8215827941894531] THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.

[0.49481201171875] Again the room was clean, even if the furnishings and fittings were a bit worn and the towels a bit thin, but again for the price we paid......
[0.49176979064941406] I didn't appreciate the bedding at all - the blankets were old and pilled and therefore I could not trust the cleanliness of the room.
[0.4844355583190918] Ok so the furniture was a bit tired but stuff worked, plenty of hot water and there was a microwave and fridge in the room.

[0.9561080932617188] Don't expect anything luxurious, but it is good value for money.
[0.954014778137207] Try it - it's basic (perhaps a 1 or 2 star at most) but it's great value for money.
[0.9518756866455078] It is good value for money although you have to pay a small amenities charge on top of your reservation cost.

[0.9514522552490234] You should get a car.
Parent: It is recommended to get a car, as it can be difficult to get around without one.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9514522552490234] We would have struggled without the hire car so I would advise you to get one!
[0.9412460327148438] A must is a car because travelling around on foot is hard the roads are really hard to cross you take your life into your own hands and wait up to 15 mins for the lights to change and watch the traffic from the right because while your crossing they are too.
[0.9362144470214844] Although this is by no means a luxurious residence, it is a perfect place to stay if you are intending to visit the theme parks, although a car is essential.
[0.9166755676269531] Hire car and drive from Sanford - ok, but be aware this hotel has changed name and the directions given by First Choice still refer to the old name.
[0.8589916229248047] A car will definitely be handy.

[-0.9954557418823242] From what I could see the rooms across from the pool looked nicer so if I would try and get one of those if you could.
[-0.9942359924316406] I would certainly reccomend this property to anyone who desires a comfortable "sleeper" at a great price
