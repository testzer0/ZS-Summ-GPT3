[0.9564094543457031] The parking lot was clean, the location of the hotel was GREAT (right next to many restaraunts, souvenier shops, and within 5 minutes to the Disnet World Parks).
[0.9555215835571289] On a better note... the hotel is in a good location and just down the road is a cafe thing where you can get an all you can eat buffet breakfast for very cheap, which served loads of fruit, cakes, a fry up, pretty much anything.
[0.953824520111084] The location couldn't be better and there are lots of restaurants around the hotel.
[0.920684814453125] Fantastic location wit restaurants, gift shops etc all within walking distance of the hotel (I did the whole thing on foot as I don't drive).
[0.9199743270874023] The hotel is actually in a good position on the 192 highway, really near to disney & close to lots of good places to eat - red lobster was the best it was just across the road.

[-0.722808837890625] What a nightmare!

[0.9749565124511719] The Hotel are ok, base on the location are very convenient , but the hotel had a bugs were I stay, due to many people check in all the time , you dont know what they bring in, I had bad experience during my stay, ( 5 nights ) the last two night I got bite by the bedbugs !

[-0.9557247161865234] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.

[-0.83355712890625] There are plenty of other hotels down the same stretch in an equally good/better location so my advice is to chose them and not stay at the quality inn!
[-0.8172950744628906] What a nightmare!

[0.3036956787109375] It is difficult to get to the hotel without a car.
Parent: However, some reviewers mention that the hotel is difficult to get to without a car.

----- Supporting -----

[0.3036956787109375] Don't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney!
[0.1114349365234375] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.108551025390625] 3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .
[0.096649169921875] Pool area cleaned daily again basic could do with some new furniture have to cross small parking lot to access, towels available daily from reception minimal charge.
[0.0923919677734375] Although this is by no means a luxurious residence, it is a perfect place to stay if you are intending to visit the theme parks, although a car is essential.
