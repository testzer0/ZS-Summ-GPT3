[-0.9955606460571289] My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.
[-0.9925670623779297] The rest of the hotel was nice but a little dated.
[-0.9900493621826172] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.
[-0.9620170593261719] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.
[-0.9452476501464844] While the beds were comfy and we had plenty of room, the guest rooms are in need of a renovation.

[0.8345327377319336] We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.

[-0.9412360191345215] It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.

[0.8332061767578125] The hotel needs to be refurbished.
Parent: However, some thought it was in need of refurbishment, particularly in the older rooms.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8332061767578125] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.
[0.7643680572509766] While the beds were comfy and we had plenty of room, the guest rooms are in need of a renovation.
[0.3201141357421875] The rest of my stay was great but definately need to get a new system in place for business travellers.. Id recommend Hilton Downtown or Marriott Airport Locations for Business Trips.
[0.11030006408691406] The rooms were clean, but when you looked closely, you would feel it needed a deep clean.. Ie around baseboards, walls and ceiling in bath, etc.
[0.1072540283203125] The lobby refurb looked great -- now they just need to tackle some of the older rooms.

[0.671356201171875] The fire alarm went off and it was really annoying.
Parent: There were some complaints about the fire alarm going off, but staff were generally praised for their handling of the situation.

----- Supporting -----

[0.671356201171875] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
[0.028191566467285156] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[0.02375030517578125] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!
[0.014288902282714844] This was incredibly annoying and extremely loud in our room.
[0.0078125] They got louder as the night progressed and started to smoke.

[-0.9779582023620605] The Hotel itself is fine and we had no complaints about anything.
[-0.9751622676849365] I have to admit that I am usually very worried about hotels and their cleanliness... but this hotel was extremely clean.

[0.9662971496582031] I hesitate to start with a description of a not-so-good experience, but the staff response to the not-so-good experience was handled so well that in the end, I left the hotel quite impressed.
[0.9198360443115234] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!
[0.9098100662231445] The staff took care of all ours needs and requests with enthusiasm and the concierge even went so far as recommend vineyards to visit for our side trip to Niagra wine country.
[0.9097342491149902] The hotel was nearly 100% full, but check-in went quickly and we felt like the staff was taking good care of us.

[-0.984771728515625] Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff.
[-0.9758005142211914] The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all".
[-0.9729442596435547] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.9540023803710938] The front desk girl didn't seem to understand the situation and said "oh there is a shoppers 2 blocks from here."

[0.9593715667724609] The location was an excellent one for us because our event was just across the street, but we also walked to dinner on Queen Street, had many shopping choices (itâ€™s connected to the Eaton Centre, or you can meander along funky Queen West) and itâ€™s close to the subway.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.553436279296875] My only negative comment about the room was the view - it looked straight into an adjacent office building.
[-0.49875640869140625] The hotel is connected to the Eaton center = dangerous!!!

[-0.8651046752929688] The Eaton Centre is just steps away.
[-0.7253570556640625] We were attending the show WE WILL ROCK YOU and decided to stay at the Marriott Eaton Centre due to the close proximity of the theatre we were attending.
[-0.7000579833984375] The shower however was very touchy and the water was either scalding hot or very cold.
[-0.6763916015625] The subway is about a block away in the basement of the mall.
[-0.642242431640625] There was a hallway that connected to the Eaton Centre.
