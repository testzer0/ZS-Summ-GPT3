[-0.9925861358642578] That being said, my room was only okay.
[-0.9899215698242188] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.9876613616943359] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.9871768951416016] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.9762639999389648] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.

[-0.839752197265625] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.
[-0.839385986328125] Now the traffic on the way to Kelowna was another thing altogether...we stayed too long and hit rush hour!

[0.7207489013671875] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.6870555877685547] I had a room with a view of False Creek, comfy beds, pleasant decor, windows that open.

[-0.5936737060546875] Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc.
