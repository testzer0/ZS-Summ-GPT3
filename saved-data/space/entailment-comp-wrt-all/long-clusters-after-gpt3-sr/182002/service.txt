[0.40569305419921875] When at the restaurant, they gave me catchup that was so rancid it bubbled.
[0.3695068359375] We have used Best Western before once on a trip to Michigan and had a miserable stay so very reluctantly we booked the Primrose.
[0.35302734375] The biggest disappointments were: -Elevators (being "updated", bumpy ride, not reliable-ended up on a floor we didn't know we could access!)

[0.8227901458740234] The front desk staff were very unfriendly and always seemed to make matters overly complicated.
[0.8052349090576172] The staff were rude and quite useless, they just seemed annoyed and unwilling to help no matter how polite we were.
[0.704986572265625] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.

[0.673095703125] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.

[0.7305679321289062] The wireless Internet, while free, is not even worth that price.

[0.7190628051757812] After circling the hotel trying to find a parking spot which I eventually did about 1/4 mile from the hotel (on the street), a bum waited in front of my car asking for money.
[0.2677001953125] I think they should use the money that they have ripped off people and take some time to fix up their hotel.
[0.23388671875] All they want is money.

[-0.5132598876953125] But that was due to the amount of rum we consumed and an amazing concert.
[-0.5007400512695312] It is a great location to explore the city by foot.
