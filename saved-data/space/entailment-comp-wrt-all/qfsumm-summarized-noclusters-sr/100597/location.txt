----- Supporting -----

[0.70050048828125] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[0.498291015625] You are charged for parking - $8/night for outdoor parking.
[0.0] All good!
[0.0] Ripoff.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9926586151123047] I think parking cost $12 or so.
[-0.9862518310546875] With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room.
[-0.9752197265625] Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.
[-0.9736976623535156] I was disappointed to learn there was a fee for parking ($16+tax), a fee for Internet ($5 for one hour), no simple breakfast included.
[-0.963958740234375] We get the stay and jet package so we park for a week for only $30.00.

[0.019378662109375] Burger, soda and tip $21.00.
[0.00209808349609375] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[0.00070953369140625] The room did not have a refrigerator or microwave; the high speed internet connection in the room cost about $10.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9776897430419922] And they add a $3 tip on top of the 18% (and then all the regular taxes are there, too).
[-0.9557685852050781] We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee.
[-0.946929931640625] :) The only complaint is - parking for overnight cost $16, and on top of that, we had $1.40 of tax!!!
[-0.852996826171875] Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax.
[-0.83209228515625] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
