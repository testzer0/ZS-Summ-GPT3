[-0.7154541015625] Need a ride to the State Fair?
[-0.29937744140625] I was so livid with how it was being handled that I was ready to completely lose it.
[-0.2931365966796875] I find that very unproffessional as a manager not to be stocked or offer to go get what the customer is requesting.
[-0.28553009033203125] It needs to be removed ASAP.
[-0.24469757080078125] As an order of french toast was around $20 I decided to walk down the street (out the front, down one block to left, take a left and Seven Eleven was on the right) and get a donut and some milk.

[0.9667773246765137] The hotel is in a nice location with good access to some great restaurants.
[0.8200693130493164] From it's convenient location to the Dallas business hub for guests, to the captivating style of the hotel, to the impeccable service, this was the perfect place for my event.
[0.8169174194335938] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[0.6456298828125] If you are headed to Dallas this is a great hotel in a great city.
[0.5919075012207031] The convenient location of The Joule allowed us to choose from a variety of restaurants.

[-0.7969818115234375] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[-0.6271438598632812] I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.
[-0.6239547729492188] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[-0.622283935546875] (Apparently we weren't the only guests to have their evening botched by this hotel).

[-0.9961414337158203] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9951753616333008] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.
[-0.9947872161865234] Only little tiny thing is the location ...
[-0.994598388671875] This hotel has a very cramped feel.
[-0.9940643310546875] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.

[-0.9092721939086914] It was a salt water pool on the 12th floor that juts out over Main Street in Dallas.
[-0.8442840576171875] The pool is small but they keep it very cool and refreshing.
[-0.8176651000976562] We used the house car, a Cadillac Escalade which took us around, nice touch but the car wasnt as clean as it should have been and the driver didnt seem like he wanted to take us.
[-0.7995758056640625] We both loved the shower.
[-0.7237548828125] Biggest issue was when we picked up our car from the valet parking.

[0.7785758972167969] The rooms are astonishing, my favorite detail in the entire room was the lights that are built into the headboard.
[0.75030517578125] When we got to our room it was very modern and high tech with all of the light switches and lamp knobs.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9899463653564453] I do think it is a lovely hotel but I would like to mention the lighting in the rooms was terrible.
[-0.7935028076171875] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.7855377197265625] Dark and moody still.
[-0.74456787109375] My only complaint about our room was that one side faced east and the bathroom window was not adequately covered so the morning sun lit up the whole room.
[-0.6094970703125] Great hotel interiors, dark moody decor in rooms.

[0.2169036865234375] Bryson also has great customer service and I enjoyed visiting with Bryson on the front sidewalk several times.
[0.215667724609375] Even if you just go into the lobby and get a drink at the hotel bar it is worth it.
[0.187774658203125] The owner is an art collector so the lobby was decorated with pieces from his own personal collection.
[0.182373046875] Loved the rose prosecco too :-) the decor was really fun and innovative throughout, like the large moving cogs by the check-in desk or the chairs in the lobby with sliding silver tables attached, or the secret reading lamp on the guestrooms headboards.
