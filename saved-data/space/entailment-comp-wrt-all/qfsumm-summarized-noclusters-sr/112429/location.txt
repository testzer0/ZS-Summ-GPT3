[0.3227996826171875] The reviews were not accurate.
Parent: Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review ; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge .

[0.3227996826171875] The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.
[0.28350830078125] My pancakes were delicious, but I was a little disappointed with the "hash brows" because they were really only cubed potatoes.
[0.2433929443359375] The Paramount is understated- the lobby is small and cozy and the location, while close to everything downtown, is subtly placed.
[0.22491455078125] Rocked up to The Paramount Hotel not expecting much after a not so nice hotel experience in New York but boy was I wrong.
[0.14678955078125] For the price I paid, I was perfectly content and I'm surprised about all the bellyaching in previous reviews - maybe they paid too much.

[-0.9913172721862793] On this last stay, I was assigned a corner room which had great views but, because of having two windows and being on the corner of a busy street, was also a bit noisier (sirens, etc.)
