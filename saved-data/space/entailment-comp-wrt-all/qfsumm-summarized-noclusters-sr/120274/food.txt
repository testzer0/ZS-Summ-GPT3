[0.9620208740234375] The location is not convenient for Universal, Prime Outlets, I Drive, etc.
Parent: The location is a little out the way for Universal , Prime Outlets ( formerly Beltz ) , I Drive etc but it 's only 5 minutes from Disney , you can see the top of Expedition Everest from the car park at the back !!

[0.48095703125] We booked with first choice and this seems to be there most budget hotel.............if you want better you'll have to pay for it i suppose, We wanted a cheap base to enjoy the local attractions but with that we also got a nice comfortable hotel room in a nice quiet area and everything was fineeeeeeeee.
