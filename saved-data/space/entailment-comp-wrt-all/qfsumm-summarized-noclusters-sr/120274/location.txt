[0.01641082763671875] The hotel is too far away from Universal and Prime Outlets.
Parent: The location is a little out the way for Universal , Prime Outlets ( formerly Beltz ) , I Drive etc but it 's only 5 minutes from Disney , you can see the top of Expedition Everest from the car park at the back !!

[0.004993438720703125] No place to lounge.
[0.00489044189453125] This is really only a basic hotel that doesn't provide many extras.
[0.00470733642578125] There are plenty of other hotels down the same stretch in an equally good/better location so my advice is to chose them and not stay at the quality inn!
[0.004608154296875] There are much better places to stay in the area, I would suggest the well known chains.
