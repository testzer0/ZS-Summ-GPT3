[0.0795745849609375] A hidden treasure of small shops with amusement rides that I didn't even know about ( I only drove by it over a dozen times) and it's mostly free!
[0.04742431640625] BUT personally i always stay clear of international drive as i find it quite run down and too busy............if you enjoy the 192 area of kissimee then this hotel is fine!
[0.0467529296875] Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative.

[-0.9884819984436035] Having done a lot of budget US motel travel in the past, this motel is little different from any of the other sub $50-a-night places that you can stay in across the USA.
[-0.9413557052612305] We have been to this complex a number of times.
[-0.8254814147949219] have stayed here many times now, an never have we complained once about anything because the rooms were great this year we even had a 4 ring hob, microwave, fridge, the room was kept so clean , clean sheets when ever we wanted towels clean every day the supervisor spoke to us every day asked if we needed anything had a smile every day we were there, how can you moan about this hotel its perfect, close to all the food outlets walgreens opposite you can walk to all the shops, what is there to moan about, if you want 5 star then go and stay in 5 star pay 5 star money bet you will moan then?
[-0.8146886825561523] Yes I know there are fancier hotels in Florida, this was our third time and we have stayed in everything from a villa to a nice hotel on International drive.
[-0.801422119140625] This is our 4th trip to Orlando in a row, and all other accomodations were top of the line, until we entered the Dark Zone.

[0.780364990234375] In my opinion the hotel across the lake (Best Western Lakeside), which rates 18th, is no better than this hotel.
[0.712646484375] An excellent budget motel, better than many in this area.
[0.6168594360351562] This is passably the best deal in the WDW area I have been to WDW over 50 times staying everywhere from the Grand Floridian to the Gator Motel this is the best deal I have found the rooms were clean (they even steam cleaned the carpets mid week) we had a view of Expedition Everest from our room the housekeeping staff was thorough and friendly as well as the front desk attendants the continental breakfast was no more than doughnuts some muffins and toast juice, milk and coffee I was traveling with a 1 and a 3 year old and didn't have to worry about them crawling on the floor
[0.48095703125] We booked with first choice and this seems to be there most budget hotel.............if you want better you'll have to pay for it i suppose, We wanted a cheap base to enjoy the local attractions but with that we also got a nice comfortable hotel room in a nice quiet area and everything was fineeeeeeeee.

[-0.9446530342102051] Bottom line - do yourself a favor: NEVER STAY at this flea bag of a hotel.
[-0.92425537109375] The hotel refused to match multiple lower rates I had found elsewhere, so I decided to cancel due to unhelpful reservation services and reserve a hotel I KNOW has superior customer service.
[-0.8540229797363281] AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!
[-0.8087673187255859] Believe me this is not a Hotel it is a Motel, the 2 1/2 Star rating is being generous it is not worthy of 1 star.
