[0.5787315368652344] The hotel parking was too expensive.
Parent: The hotel parking was a little expensive ( CAN $ 15 ) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV .

----- Supporting -----

[0.5787315368652344] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.1661376953125] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.103546142578125] Although it would have been more convenient for me to stay at the hotel the meeting was in, their prices were far too expensive for my budget.
[0.08563232421875] Afterwards the Manager acknowledged that the lifts are in need of urgent replacement but due to the cost this has yet to be authorised.
[0.056964874267578125] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9697775840759277] It was close to the theatre we were going to and the price was affordable.
[-0.9658117294311523] The price was also quite reasonable.
[-0.9406905174255371] We got an excellent rate because we were doing business in the hotel.
[-0.9152941703796387] I was given a discount as I was a senior so the price ended up being very reasonable.
[-0.9112691879272461] Several of the attendees also stayed at the hotel and were able to get a discounted rate as part of the session.

[0.9926762580871582] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.

[-0.9355316162109375] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[-0.88031005859375] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[-0.8762893676757812] What is it with $20 hotel breakfasts in Toronto?
[-0.8498077392578125] The breakfast is $12.95 for pre cooked eggs, bacon,etc.

Parent: The hotel parking was a little expensive ( CAN $ 15 ) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV .

----- Supporting -----

[0.268341064453125] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.
[0.064605712890625] It is worth noting that the parking garage has very little clearance, and some of the tightest turns I have ever had to negotiate.
[0.0355072021484375] The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage.
[0.029754638671875] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.009243011474609375] If you have a van or larger vehicle forget parking here.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9865269660949707] The room itself was very spacious and clean.

[-0.9787874221801758] However on arriving found the hotel room to be very spacious, clean and very comfortable.

[0.3539581298828125] The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car.
[0.1348876953125] 1) Rude staff at the front desk (only one of the employees we dealt with were nice); 2) Restaurant only open part of the time; 3) They DID give us a bigger and cheaper parking space out behind the building because our SUV wouldn't fit in the underground parking, but there were junkies hanging around at that parking lot; 3) FOUND A BEDBUG IN THE BATHROOM SINK (ALIVE) -- 'NUFF SAID!
