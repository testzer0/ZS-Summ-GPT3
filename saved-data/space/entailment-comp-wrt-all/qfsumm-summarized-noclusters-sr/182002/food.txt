[0.9012069702148438] We have never been to Canada before or to a huge city like Toronto, we found it very easy to get around, Primrose hotel is an excellent location as the subway is only 5min walk way .There is a lot of restaurants , bars, stores ,drugmarts and shops within walking distance also Dundas sq , Eaton centre &hockey Hall of Fame are close by.
[0.8028316497802734] I can honestly say the Best Western Primrose Hotel, Toronto Downtown was one of the very best I have had the pleasure of staying in.
[0.6401920318603516] We had a good time in the city and would use the Primrose Hotel again.

[0.14141845703125] So we went to Toronto for a girlâ€™s weekend out and booked 2 rooms at the Primrose Hotel online after finding a good deal on Hotwire.
[0.1094818115234375] I would suggest this hotel if coming to visit the Church Street Village for nightlife and if you wish to visit the rest of the city a subway station is within easy walking distance.

[0.098846435546875] We had a fantastic weekend out, and the hotel was perfect for what we needed.
[0.0386962890625] I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a nice weekend getaway or a family looking for a vacation.
[0.0291748046875] Other than the hotel is OK, but far from great.
[0.024444580078125] I would describe it as typical Best Western standard 3 star hotel quality, nothing special and no frills.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9895839691162109] I guess this hotel would be ok for people who are looking to party.
[-0.9869668483734131] This restaurant has a loyal group of customers.
[-0.9865107536315918] great for shopping, dining & partying.
[-0.9775943756103516] There was also a business room where you could enjoy free internet and use of the fax and printer.
[-0.9769725799560547] Pool was good â€“ it was outside so able to get some sun tanning in too.

[0.5449542999267578] The cost of parking is too high.
Parent: The hotel parking was a little expensive ( CAN $ 15 ) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV .

----- Supporting -----

[0.5449542999267578] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[0.35414886474609375] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.33323097229003906] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.0382080078125] Afterwards the Manager acknowledged that the lifts are in need of urgent replacement but due to the cost this has yet to be authorised.
[0.0248565673828125] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9721012115478516] It is free.
[-0.9702143669128418] It was close to the theatre we were going to and the price was affordable.
[-0.937861442565918] The price was good and they had a room with a king bed open.
[-0.9044380187988281] Very good value for your money, in a very good location.

[0.47515869140625] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.
[0.080322265625] The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service.
[0.076904296875] The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage.
[0.060577392578125] For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9890384674072266] It was a very large room for a great price.
[-0.9875564575195312] The hotel is older but the room was huge and had a view all the way to the lake.
[-0.9838199615478516] The room was wickedly huge and we had tons of space.
[-0.9829845428466797] Large room, with really nice and comfy duvets, and overall much nicer than I've seen from most hotels in Toronto in this price range.
[-0.98187255859375] The room itself was very spacious and clean.

[0.9738297462463379] The location is great.
[0.9737763404846191] The location was good, right where I needed to be, and the price was great for downtown and I only paid $89 with a corporate discount.
[0.9650945663452148] The location is good and it was close to a great Thai food restaurant which I would recommend if you like Thai.
[0.949254035949707] We were pleased with the choice, and the location was perfect.
[0.9411802291870117] The location is good being a short walk into town and is close to the new Loblaws food emporium at Maple Leaf Gardens.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9481391906738281] It is very worn and in a terrible area of town.
[-0.7888870239257812] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.
[-0.775360107421875] I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump.
[-0.7373008728027344] I've stayed in many places around the world but this was the worst.
[-0.707305908203125] The underground parking is horribly laid out.
