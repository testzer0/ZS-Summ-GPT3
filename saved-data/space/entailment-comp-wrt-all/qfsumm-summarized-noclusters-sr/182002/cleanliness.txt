[0.021240234375] Other than the hotel is OK, but far from great.
[0.002197265625] the hotel is centrally located and is very comfortable with a nice bed and rooms cleaned daily.

[0.7417526245117188] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.645263671875] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.585174560546875] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.30712890625] The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot!

[0.47515869140625] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.
[0.080322265625] The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service.
[0.076904296875] The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage.
[0.060577392578125] For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not.
