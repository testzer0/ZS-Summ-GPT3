[0.9012069702148438] We have never been to Canada before or to a huge city like Toronto, we found it very easy to get around, Primrose hotel is an excellent location as the subway is only 5min walk way .There is a lot of restaurants , bars, stores ,drugmarts and shops within walking distance also Dundas sq , Eaton centre &hockey Hall of Fame are close by.
[0.8028316497802734] I can honestly say the Best Western Primrose Hotel, Toronto Downtown was one of the very best I have had the pleasure of staying in.

[0.1462860107421875] I would suggest this hotel if coming to visit the Church Street Village for nightlife and if you wish to visit the rest of the city a subway station is within easy walking distance.
[0.12322998046875] Recently spent a night in Toronto to do some shopping and stayed overnight at the Primrose Hotel after finding a good price online.
[0.0738067626953125] Went to Toronto for a weekend â€œstaycationâ€� and got a cheap room online at the Primrose Hotel.
[0.07122802734375] As Toronto was heavily booked up for the evening, I had to stay at the Best Western Primrose, and I was happy it was only for a single night.

[0.9738297462463379] The location was good.
Parent: It was in a good location on Carlton / College Ave. .

----- Supporting -----

[0.9738297462463379] The location is great.
[0.9737763404846191] The location was good, right where I needed to be, and the price was great for downtown and I only paid $89 with a corporate discount.
[0.9650945663452148] The location is good and it was close to a great Thai food restaurant which I would recommend if you like Thai.
[0.949254035949707] We were pleased with the choice, and the location was perfect.
[0.9411802291870117] The location is good being a short walk into town and is close to the new Loblaws food emporium at Maple Leaf Gardens.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9481391906738281] It is very worn and in a terrible area of town.
[-0.7888870239257812] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.
[-0.775360107421875] I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump.
[-0.7373008728027344] I've stayed in many places around the world but this was the worst.
[-0.707305908203125] The underground parking is horribly laid out.

[0.002780914306640625] Very good value for your money, in a very good location.
[0.0025110244750976562] We had an absolutely fabulous time.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.977452278137207] Bankok Garden on Elm st. is wonderful for Thai.
[-0.9265213012695312] it is right on Younge down near Dundas.
[-0.9210433959960938] I would suggest this hotel if coming to visit the Church Street Village for nightlife and if you wish to visit the rest of the city a subway station is within easy walking distance.
[-0.8497447967529297] Location a few blocks from Yonge street where all the shops and restaurants are.
[-0.8467979431152344] It was only a few blocks east of Yonge St.

[0.5941810607910156] The hotel parking is too expensive.
Parent: The hotel parking was a little expensive ( CAN $ 15 ) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV .

----- Supporting -----

[0.5941810607910156] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.0851287841796875] Afterwards the Manager acknowledged that the lifts are in need of urgent replacement but due to the cost this has yet to be authorised.
[0.054931640625] Although it would have been more convenient for me to stay at the hotel the meeting was in, their prices were far too expensive for my budget.
[0.0439453125] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.037021636962890625] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9624037742614746] The price was also quite reasonable.
[-0.9535613059997559] It was close to the theatre we were going to and the price was affordable.
[-0.9299592971801758] We got an excellent rate because we were doing business in the hotel.
[-0.9260334968566895] Several of the attendees also stayed at the hotel and were able to get a discounted rate as part of the session.
[-0.9048619270324707] It is free.

[0.9841384887695312] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.

[-0.975341796875] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[-0.9522247314453125] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[-0.92181396484375] It is free.
[-0.8085174560546875] What is it with $20 hotel breakfasts in Toronto?
[-0.744903564453125] The price was amazing ($90 CAD) and parking was typical at $23/day/in & out privileges.

[0.47515869140625] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.
[0.080322265625] The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service.
[0.076904296875] The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage.
[0.060577392578125] For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9890384674072266] It was a very large room for a great price.
[-0.9875564575195312] The hotel is older but the room was huge and had a view all the way to the lake.
[-0.9838199615478516] The room was wickedly huge and we had tons of space.
[-0.9829845428466797] Large room, with really nice and comfy duvets, and overall much nicer than I've seen from most hotels in Toronto in this price range.
[-0.98187255859375] The room itself was very spacious and clean.

[0.6344833374023438] The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car.
[0.435791015625] If you have a van or larger vehicle forget parking here.
[0.22275543212890625] 1) Rude staff at the front desk (only one of the employees we dealt with were nice); 2) Restaurant only open part of the time; 3) They DID give us a bigger and cheaper parking space out behind the building because our SUV wouldn't fit in the underground parking, but there were junkies hanging around at that parking lot; 3) FOUND A BEDBUG IN THE BATHROOM SINK (ALIVE) -- 'NUFF SAID!
[0.09616851806640625] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.712615966796875] The room itself was nice.
[-0.688629150390625] This is especially important now that they are installing kitchenettes in some of the rooms.
[-0.67144775390625] The room also included a sofa bed.
[-0.6541595458984375] The laundry left something to be desired.
[-0.65338134765625] Despite it being a kitchenette, it was a joke to have a little stove, no cutleries provided unless asked.
