[0.9553580284118652] The Primrose is a good hotel.
Parent: The Primrose is a good hotel for people who plan on staying just a few dates in Toronto and plan on only sleeping there .

[0.9553580284118652] My stay was for three days at the Primrose and I found it to be a fine hotel.
[0.9453201293945312] The Primrose is a good hotel for people who plan on staying just a few dates in Toronto and plan on only sleeping there.
[0.9012069702148438] We have never been to Canada before or to a huge city like Toronto, we found it very easy to get around, Primrose hotel is an excellent location as the subway is only 5min walk way .There is a lot of restaurants , bars, stores ,drugmarts and shops within walking distance also Dundas sq , Eaton centre &hockey Hall of Fame are close by.
[0.8028316497802734] I can honestly say the Best Western Primrose Hotel, Toronto Downtown was one of the very best I have had the pleasure of staying in.
[0.6401920318603516] We had a good time in the city and would use the Primrose Hotel again.

[0.1637420654296875] So we went to Toronto for a girlâ€™s weekend out and booked 2 rooms at the Primrose Hotel online after finding a good deal on Hotwire.
[0.09517669677734375] Went to Toronto for a weekend â€œstaycationâ€� and got a cheap room online at the Primrose Hotel.
[0.0577850341796875] I was booked in here as part of a city break package, while visiting friends in the Toronto area.
[0.046558380126953125] Met some long time friends in toronto for the weekend, I decided to come into town last minuet and found the primrose cause the delta gave my room away?

[0.9466400146484375] The Primrose is a good hotel for people who plan on staying just a few dates in Toronto and plan on only sleeping there.
[0.0590667724609375] This is a decent hotel, but factor in the low prices, great location and little perks like free wi-fi, and I'd say that it's one of the best I've stayed in.
[0.0185546875] I would describe it as typical Best Western standard 3 star hotel quality, nothing special and no frills.
[0.017498016357421875] Other than the hotel is OK, but far from great.
[0.0159149169921875] The price is very good and the rooms are large, the only issue with the hotel is its very dated and could do with a revamp.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9884848594665527] I guess this hotel would be ok for people who are looking to party.
[-0.9883770942687988] This restaurant has a loyal group of customers.
[-0.9780633449554443] great for shopping, dining & partying.
[-0.9764933586120605] We did order food and beverage and were pleased with the variety of choices available for lunches.
[-0.9723272323608398] We occupied the Starlight room on the 23rd floor and found the room to be ideal for our training sessions.

[0.9773654937744141] The hotel parking was expensive.
Parent: The hotel parking was a little expensive ( CAN $ 15 ) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV .

[0.9773654937744141] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.7417526245117188] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.645263671875] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.585174560546875] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.30712890625] The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7845935821533203] The price was also quite reasonable.
[-0.7154254913330078] It is free.
[-0.6174507141113281] Many places I visit charge ridicules rates for internet so the fact it was free was great.
[-0.6016387939453125] Had daily continental or hot breakfast for an unreasonable cost for the 'menu' - try the local restaurants or delivery) Overall, reasonable cost for duration; comfortable, quiet, clean rooms; and you receive Best Western Club points or Airmiles for your stay.
[-0.5867586135864258] It was close to the theatre we were going to and the price was affordable.

[0.47515869140625] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.
[0.080322265625] The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service.
[0.076904296875] The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage.
[0.060577392578125] For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not.

[-0.9890384674072266] It was a very large room for a great price.
[-0.9875564575195312] The hotel is older but the room was huge and had a view all the way to the lake.
[-0.9838199615478516] The room was wickedly huge and we had tons of space.
[-0.9829845428466797] Large room, with really nice and comfy duvets, and overall much nicer than I've seen from most hotels in Toronto in this price range.
[-0.98187255859375] The room itself was very spacious and clean.

[0.10011148452758789] The rooms were dusty.
The heater did not function properly.

[0.10011148452758789] The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service.
[0.09147071838378906] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.08479881286621094] The dust built up in the bathroom and on the carpet was substantial, seriously dust bunnies.
[0.0835733413696289] The shower was disgusting and there were marks all over the walls and carpet.
[0.053473472595214844] The rooms are old, the bathroom smelled, we had a view of air conditioners and the gym was a joke.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7008382081985474] Great wi-fi service too.
[-0.6694550514221191] They were also kind enough to recommend and make reservations at a lovely restaurant called Ruth Chris (pricey but well worth it if you are a steak lover).
[-0.6630072593688965] Free internet access worked fine, but not fast.
[-0.6573779582977295] There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.
[-0.6490380764007568] Everything went very smoothly.
