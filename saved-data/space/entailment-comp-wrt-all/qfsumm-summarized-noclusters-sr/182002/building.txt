[0.9012069702148438] We have never been to Canada before or to a huge city like Toronto, we found it very easy to get around, Primrose hotel is an excellent location as the subway is only 5min walk way .There is a lot of restaurants , bars, stores ,drugmarts and shops within walking distance also Dundas sq , Eaton centre &hockey Hall of Fame are close by.
[0.8028316497802734] I can honestly say the Best Western Primrose Hotel, Toronto Downtown was one of the very best I have had the pleasure of staying in.

[-0.8709831237792969] But if you're thinking of staying at this one, pass it up.
[-0.8569793701171875] Don't stay at this hotel unless you like slow (and possibly unsafe) elevators, flaky wireless Internet, and poor customer service.

[0.5449542999267578] The cost of parking is too high.
Parent: The hotel parking was a little expensive ( CAN $ 15 ) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV .

----- Supporting -----

[0.5449542999267578] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[0.35414886474609375] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.33323097229003906] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.0382080078125] Afterwards the Manager acknowledged that the lifts are in need of urgent replacement but due to the cost this has yet to be authorised.

[-0.9702143669128418] It was close to the theatre we were going to and the price was affordable.
[-0.937861442565918] The price was good and they had a room with a king bed open.

[0.47515869140625] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.
[0.080322265625] The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service.
[0.076904296875] The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage.
[0.060577392578125] For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not.

[-0.9890384674072266] It was a very large room for a great price.

[0.3685302734375] The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car.
[0.1472320556640625] 1) Rude staff at the front desk (only one of the employees we dealt with were nice); 2) Restaurant only open part of the time; 3) They DID give us a bigger and cheaper parking space out behind the building because our SUV wouldn't fit in the underground parking, but there were junkies hanging around at that parking lot; 3) FOUND A BEDBUG IN THE BATHROOM SINK (ALIVE) -- 'NUFF SAID!

[-0.6800689697265625] This is especially important now that they are installing kitchenettes in some of the rooms.
[-0.6787109375] It was a decent sized room and had a desk and a couch in it.
[-0.66754150390625] Despite it being a kitchenette, it was a joke to have a little stove, no cutleries provided unless asked.
[-0.6668243408203125] We had a King bed which was comfy and the pillows were great.

[0.9737763404846191] The location was good, right where I needed to be, and the price was great for downtown and I only paid $89 with a corporate discount.
[0.9650945663452148] The location is good and it was close to a great Thai food restaurant which I would recommend if you like Thai.
[0.949254035949707] We were pleased with the choice, and the location was perfect.
[0.9411802291870117] The location is good being a short walk into town and is close to the new Loblaws food emporium at Maple Leaf Gardens.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9481391906738281] It is very worn and in a terrible area of town.
[-0.7888870239257812] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.
[-0.775360107421875] I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump.
[-0.7373008728027344] I've stayed in many places around the world but this was the worst.

[-0.9129753112792969] it is right on Younge down near Dundas.
[-0.9118537902832031] I would suggest this hotel if coming to visit the Church Street Village for nightlife and if you wish to visit the rest of the city a subway station is within easy walking distance.
