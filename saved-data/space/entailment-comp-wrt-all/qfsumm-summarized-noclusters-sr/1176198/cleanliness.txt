[0.53125] Stayed here for our last night at end of two weeks in Canada, having stayed at the Marriot Residence Inn in the Entertainment district for the first 3 nights of our holiday, Whilst we got a good value deal there for a one bedroom suite, I have to say I preferred the Hilton.

[0.1287841796875] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!

[0.039886474609375] Two nights we did have a guest, who had orginally intended to attend the conference: despite being assured on the phone that we could add a rollaway for him, when he arrived, we couldn't, and he and my colleague had to split a regular bed.
[0.0394287109375] Hotel rooms and restaurant = great "Valet" = brutal and ruined the whole stay.
