[-0.73394775390625] When I called to cancel, rather than just accept my cancellation request and take the money (I prepaid a nonrefunable sum for the room), they directed me to a manager person, who immediately heard my concerns and showed me objective evidence of what measures were taken to ensure that no bedbugs were in this hotel.
