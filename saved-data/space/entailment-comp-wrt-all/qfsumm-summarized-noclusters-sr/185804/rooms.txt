[0.9859356880187988] The public spaces are decorated.
Parent: The public spaces are nicely decorated , but our room had a couple of sad " department store " prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity , I would have loved to see better art ( why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street , and promote local artists ? )

[-0.9695301055908203] The rooms are small and sparsely furnished.
[-0.8779983520507812] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.8383655548095703] Just somewhere to sleep.
[-0.7903480529785156] There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.

[-0.8939647674560547] We had in-room massages provided by the spa just down the road and there was plenty of space for side-by-side table setup.
[-0.8833465576171875] We could hear chairs and people moving around in the adjoining room as if it was in our room mostly because of the echoing from the marble floors.
[-0.8415145874023438] In the other part of the room, we could sleep or just have breakfast in bed while watching the other television in the room.
[-0.756927490234375] The room was quiet and we did not notice any noise from "neighbors".
[-0.7104644775390625] However the soap was a good and generous size.

[0.9306678771972656] I've stayed in all types, all ratings of hotels around the world and I rank Granville Island Hotel as one of my top picks due to the location and relaxed environment... especially for an adult getaway.
[0.9188728332519531] Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
[0.8822479248046875] If you're looking for a smaller (decent sized) hotel with a relaxed environment (not to mention romantic), and is a 3 minute drive (5 minute water taxi ride) from downtown Vancouver, then this IS the hotel for you.

[-0.9968838691711426] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.9966840744018555] It was exceptionally noisy.
[-0.9960556030273438] The V-shaped hotel has its restaurant and bar seating within the V, making for noisy evenings in your room.
[-0.991851806640625] The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.
[-0.9915132522583008] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8509693145751953] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.8307819366455078] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.8031082153320312] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.7822952270507812] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.7501602172851562] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.

[0.207122802734375] All the rooms have some view of the water and although they are small and expensive it is worth it.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9010086059570312] It's a really cool market.
[-0.891326904296875] Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel.
[-0.8741874694824219] You do have a art institute across the road.
[-0.8396453857421875] So if the hotel itself is real important and you intend to spend alot of time in the room itself, I don't recommend this hotel to you.
[-0.8291549682617188] Basically a food market and some specialist shops.

[-0.9436874389648438] We also stayed at the Slyvia Hotel in the West end, next door to Stanley Park, and that was much better value, both in regard to location, and space.
[-0.8908958435058594] You do have a art institute across the road.
[-0.8791656494140625] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.
[-0.86993408203125] The market may be unique in North America, but in the UK most towns and cities have a market at least as good.

[0.891815185546875] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[0.45233917236328125] It was very easy to travel around Vancouver from here.
[0.225250244140625] The wonderful public market and numerous restaurants and shops are just a quick walk away, as are the ferries that take you to other parts of Vancouver.
[0.20501708984375] Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes.

[-0.9474773406982422] Now the traffic on the way to Kelowna was another thing altogether...we stayed too long and hit rush hour!

[-0.8381500244140625] Granville Island is very busy, & I frequently could not find hotel parking.
[-0.8355827331542969] Really rocking and that's not a bad thing eh :) But chasing down something to eat this late on the island was hopeless.
