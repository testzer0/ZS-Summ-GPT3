[0.9791479110717773] The public spaces are nicely decorated.
Parent: The public spaces are nicely decorated , but our room had a couple of sad " department store " prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity , I would have loved to see better art ( why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street , and promote local artists ? )

[-0.9903783798217773] The rooms are small and sparsely furnished.
[-0.9412212371826172] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.8977890014648438] There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.
[-0.8899211883544922] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.

[-0.8950977325439453] We had in-room massages provided by the spa just down the road and there was plenty of space for side-by-side table setup.
[-0.8566818237304688] We could hear chairs and people moving around in the adjoining room as if it was in our room mostly because of the echoing from the marble floors.
[-0.7776641845703125] The room was quiet and we did not notice any noise from "neighbors".
[-0.7693939208984375] In the other part of the room, we could sleep or just have breakfast in bed while watching the other television in the room.
[-0.7599334716796875] The rooms in the section away from the Front Desk by the banquet rooms seemed larger than those in the wing closer to the Front Desk.

[0.84490966796875] The hotel is very modern, with the feel of a boutique 5 star hotel.
[0.273681640625] The hotel restaraunt was ok, not outstanding but pretty good.
[0.195068359375] I stay at other expensive hotels similar to this and they do this service, they also do not charge for the bikes if you are a guest of the hotel.
[0.15820884704589844] For one it is the only hotel on the island and two it is a very nice hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9602165222167969] Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel.
[-0.939208984375] It's a really cool market.
[-0.93023681640625] It features a children's carnival, which is great for families, but not very appealing to business travelers.
[-0.8965530395507812] A design school campus brings a funky element to the scene as well as individual artist studios.
[-0.8838386535644531] The market may be unique in North America, but in the UK most towns and cities have a market at least as good.

[-0.9436874389648438] We also stayed at the Slyvia Hotel in the West end, next door to Stanley Park, and that was much better value, both in regard to location, and space.
[-0.8908958435058594] You do have a art institute across the road.
[-0.8791656494140625] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.

[-0.9965825080871582] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.994816780090332] The room also had a weird smell.
