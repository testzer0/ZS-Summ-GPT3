[-0.9769821166992188] We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.
