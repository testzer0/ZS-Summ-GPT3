[-0.9973926544189453] The staff was exteremly rude, rooms out dated and smelled!
[-0.9966564178466797] Firstly we could not find the hotel, we needed to go a bit further down on the 192 than we were doing but when we finally got we got checked in very quickly, be warned the reception staff are very rude and unhelpful!!
[-0.996645450592041] The manager on duty was unfriendly and didn't even offer help, until he finally called the police.
[-0.9961872100830078] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.
[-0.9949979782104492] The hotel refused to match multiple lower rates I had found elsewhere, so I decided to cancel due to unhelpful reservation services and reserve a hotel I KNOW has superior customer service.

[0.7502517700195312] Landscaping was terrible,elevators were dirty and anywhere outside of the room was not well maintained.
[0.7428474426269531] I didn't appreciate the bedding at all - the blankets were old and pilled and therefore I could not trust the cleanliness of the room.
[0.7210216522216797] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.
[0.6956787109375] First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.
[0.6793365478515625] I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!
