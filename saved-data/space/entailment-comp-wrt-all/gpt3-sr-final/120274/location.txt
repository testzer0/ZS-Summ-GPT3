[0.9530200958251953] have stayed here many times now, an never have we complained once about anything because the rooms were great this year we even had a 4 ring hob, microwave, fridge, the room was kept so clean , clean sheets when ever we wanted towels clean every day the supervisor spoke to us every day asked if we needed anything had a smile every day we were there, how can you moan about this hotel its perfect, close to all the food outlets walgreens opposite you can walk to all the shops, what is there to moan about, if you want 5 star then go and stay in 5 star pay 5 star money bet you will moan then?

[0.6587448120117188] The location is inconvenient.
Parent: However, some people find the location of the hotel to be a little out of the way.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6587448120117188] It's not the best location as you do need to drive everywhere but that was all part of the fun for us!!
[0.23952484130859375] The wireless internet--somewhat annoying to have to go to the lobby, since it doesn't reach to the rooms.
[0.21275711059570312] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.14226531982421875] You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.
[0.124969482421875] I'm pretty sure they gave us this hotel so we can compare the 5 star accomadation to this dirty location.
