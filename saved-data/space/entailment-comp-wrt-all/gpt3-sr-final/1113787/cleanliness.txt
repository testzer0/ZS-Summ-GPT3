----- Supporting -----

[0.977849006652832] I would recommend this hotel to anyone; it is clean, luxurious and has out of this world service.
[0.9744148254394531] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
[0.8958053588867188] The hotel is gorgeous and our room was clean, modern, and just as I expected a Luxury Starwood Hotel should be.
[0.8287506103515625] I felt like we were in a clean and futuristic hotel.
[0.7447509765625] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9903755187988281] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[-0.9859371185302734] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.983607292175293] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.9741744995117188] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.9623889923095703] It needs to be removed ASAP.
