[-0.9911985397338867] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.
[-0.9891147613525391] The room also had a weird smell.
[-0.9868545532226562] It is a mash up of 80s smoked glass and more recent upgrades and pseudo renovations.
[-0.98681640625] * The doors, wallpaper and carpets need to be redone.
[-0.9860458374023438] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
