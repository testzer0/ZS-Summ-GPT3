[0.3371429443359375] Granville Island is actually a little peninsula (more like a giant pier) with a very laid back feel to it, complete with a down-home fresh foods market, like something you would see in the movies.
[0.3227043151855469] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[0.14258956909179688] There are several shops and plenty of excellent places to eat FRESH seafood, including the Dockside Restaurant and pub (microbrew).
[0.1315326690673828] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.

[-0.88397216796875] Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc.
[-0.7837028503417969] We only have two comments - we were planning on a "nightcap" when we got back from the theatre on a Saturday night at 10:30 - only to discover that both the dining room and the lounge were closed at this early hour.
