[0.2776679992675781] I have stayed in many of the downtown hotels in Seattle and I have to say that the Paramount is one of the nicest hotels downtown.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8993148803710938] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.849334716796875] The hotel restuarant, Dragonfish, was good.
[-0.718017578125] The rooms for the price were not very good.

[-0.9914455413818359] Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge.
