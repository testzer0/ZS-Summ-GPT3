[0.677001953125] Rooms were nice in decor but there was dirt under the beds, TV was tiny, wireless internet was horrible, room was very small, pool and hot tub were tiny and full of rowdy kids with no one enforcing the rules of no jumping or horseplay, could not enjoy it at all.
[0.495819091796875] Parking was a little crouded but they were very busy.
[0.4700164794921875] The staff worked very hard to keep up with the big crowd in the middle of the week.
[0.427734375] "DELUXE" continental breakfast was not bad if you could get near it, crowd were backed up across the parking lot and we finally gave up and went elsewhere.
[0.40655517578125] Breakfast was ok but poorly stocked, there were only ~10 rooms rented while we were there so no excuse for overcrowded.
