[0.068603515625] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.

[0.54193115234375] Excellent hotel that hides into an average gray downtown building, standing on an average not important street.
[0.19996404647827148] The location was good for us but it is definitely not the nicest area of town.
