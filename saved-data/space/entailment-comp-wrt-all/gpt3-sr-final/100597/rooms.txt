[0.9696359634399414] My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting.
[0.9609336853027344] The hotel was clean, beds were fine, hotel is located across the street from the air port, was within walking distance to a Denny's, Jack in the Box, and a steak place.
[0.807586669921875] Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room.

[-0.9976372718811035] We couldn't hear them in our room (thankfully), but they were pretty loud throughout the hotel.
[-0.997227668762207] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[-0.995844841003418] When you finally reach your room the heaters all make tremendous noise, rattle, rumble.
[-0.9948759078979492] Princess has the contract for cruise passengers so you'll meet a lot of people coming and going on trips in the lobby or restaurant.
[-0.9946918487548828] The hotel is big and busy, so it always feels like there is some commotion going on in the common areas.

[0.837615966796875] The food prices are too high.
Parent: However, some guests have complained about the food prices and overall cost of the hotel.

----- Supporting -----

[0.837615966796875] Food was good, but a bit overpriced.
[0.6513519287109375] With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room.
[0.6351470947265625] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).
[0.47442626953125] Food was very expensive in restaurant and just okay.
[0.061248779296875] That worked well for me since the food at the hotel is fairly pricey.

[0.0738372802734375] I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car.
[0.06539154052734375] Priceline should be ASHAMED of rating it up with the Hilton SEATAC, where I was placed on the first night.
[0.040859222412109375] If I had transportation and didn't have events at the hotel, I would look a few miles away for a better buy for the money.

[-0.9664287567138672] The room was a bit basic and dated but it was inexpensive and we could leave our car in their car park while we were on holiday.
[-0.9593329429626465] Overall it was still a reasonable deal though.
[-0.9527573585510254] It's a solid 3* hotel and good value.
[-0.9378151893615723] Overall I was quite pleased as we paid only $50 through Priceline.
