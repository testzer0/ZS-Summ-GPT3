[0.9025583267211914] The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms.
[0.11381149291992188] We had a large room with a balcony, comfortable beds, an easy chair and ottoman, and a coffee maker - all things we don't always find.
[0.11050033569335938] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
[0.06151390075683594] The walk out balcony was a nice surprise.
[0.05342674255371094] The pool area, lobby and view from the balcony were very nice, not what I normally find when traveling and especially not this close to the airport!

[0.9185009002685547] --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
[0.7744617462158203] Parts of the hotel are laid-out such that it can be difficult to find your room.
[0.7727985382080078] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.

[0.5532646179199219] Our room was in the main tower, and was reached by an external elevator with glass walls.

[0.9691562652587891] The hotel is divided into different wings.
[0.746063232421875] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
