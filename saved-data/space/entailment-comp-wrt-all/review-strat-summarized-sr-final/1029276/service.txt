[-0.9920196533203125] The breakfast was actually the highlight but the service at this hotel was disorganized and rude!
[-0.9733753204345703] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
[-0.9723014831542969] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.
[-0.96795654296875] I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami.
[-0.9599990844726562] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.

[0.13336181640625] The Hilton Honors lounge had a very nice breakfast available but it seemed that the superivisor was the only one who took the initiative to clean tables, so was hard to find a clean one.

[-0.9949092864990234] As we arrived we parked on the street, there was constructiono but being that we live on Sobe we knew the area and parking area well...so we avoided the $29 valet parking per day....We were greeted by Andrew, excellent front desk person who gave us a room on the high floor....I told him it was my birthday weekend and he tried to make it very special for me and my family...we then went to lobby to wait for room, excellent service also...The service at every place we went was superb...i even thought i wasn't in Miami...lol..everyone super friendly....the pool bartender also....In the executive lounge, service was great too...nothing to complaint....our room had a great view of the port and bayside also miami beach and the bed was amazing.......

[0.9856762886047363] The area was not safe to walk around in.
Parent: There were also some comments about the area not being safe to walk around in, but this did not seem to be a reflection of the service at the hotel itself.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9856762886047363] The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in.
[0.90411376953125] Downtown did not feel safe at all, and there were alot of unsavoury looks as we did walk 4 blocks from the Hotel.
[0.3611869812011719] Our only gripe was the area... We live in the NE of England so are used to a bit of rough and tumble but upon leaving the hotel each time we felt really uneasy!!!
[0.3563385009765625] No room safe or fridge - ice down the hall.
[0.3023529052734375] Not only did the three of us feel unsafe but we were scared to stay in the room for fear the guard might have access to our room.

[0.544464111328125] $28/day for valet and $25/day self parking...very expensive Blood stains on pillow cases...contacted front desk about the issue and they reacted like it was a normal thing and would mention it to housekeeping.
[0.2669677734375] Good amenities without a lot of nickel-and-diming, eg, free high-speed Internet with 5 or 6 terminals and connected printers.
[0.2113037109375] We all know hotel phones are pricey, so we kept the calls short, but even still - the rates aren't advertised anywhere in the room.
[0.183837890625] The breakfast buffet wasn't included in the price but we enjoyed continental breakfast.
[0.1676025390625] We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8498382568359375] The buffet breakfast (whcich was part of the room rate) was very good I must say, although it was the same every day, but we didn't mind).
[-0.66424560546875] What they should say is per computer.
[-0.6031951904296875] For me, it's the little details that make a hotel worth the money, and the Hilton just doesn't have the attention to detail that a hotel of its caliber should.
[-0.5887298583984375] They just said they ran out.
[-0.58868408203125] Upon arrival at the motel my party was told that we couldn't be checked into a room despite paying our trip in advance because they were having issues receiving payment from the vendor.
