Parent: The accounts were mixed on the location of the hotel.

----- Supporting -----

[0.481781005859375] So even though there was a mix up with my bag which caused me some frustration and sleeplessness, the Hilton more than made up for it.
[0.39007568359375] The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it.
[0.35040283203125] Bar service at busy times was a little haphazard - incorrect orders although they did make amends for errors.
[0.303863525390625] We called and they said they had one room but the water was green too.
[0.2967529296875] Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9919977188110352] I must say my most recent experience at this Hotel has really blown me away.
[-0.9901266098022461] What I got was beyond what I expected - I was stuffed to the brim.
[-0.9895172119140625] Each of the staff we had interactions with were very helpful.

[0.9279041290283203] Not right in South Beach, but this hotel still has a very good location near the Biscayne Bay with beautiful views!
[0.9155130386352539] Great Hotel perfect location, although there was a lot of construction around the hotel.
[0.8852939605712891] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
[0.8693637847900391] Hotel was ideally located for the purpose of my business trip.

[-0.9783134460449219] I did not like the area the hotel was in i would of prefered south beach area.
[-0.9594478607177734] The location is less than optimal - the northern edge of Downtown.
[-0.953338623046875] On-site restaurant was simply okay, surrounding neighborhood was very blah, and the staff was ambivalent.
[-0.9512405395507812] One of the downsides to this motel is the location.
[-0.9250106811523438] Being downtown the hotel is a bit lacking in local amenities.

[0.497833251953125] The hotel was good for a family vacation.
Parent: Some found it to be good for a family vacation, while others found it to be less than impressive.

----- Supporting -----

[0.497833251953125] I accepted since the only reason I stayed at this Hilton was for a good nights sleep while starting a family vacation.
[0.28449440002441406] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!
[0.2646331787109375] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.23115158081054688] As we arrived we parked on the street, there was constructiono but being that we live on Sobe we knew the area and parking area well...so we avoided the $29 valet parking per day....We were greeted by Andrew, excellent front desk person who gave us a room on the high floor....I told him it was my birthday weekend and he tried to make it very special for me and my family...we then went to lobby to wait for room, excellent service also...The service at every place we went was superb...i even thought i wasn't in Miami...lol..everyone super friendly....the pool bartender also....In the executive lounge, service was great too...nothing to complaint....our room had a great view of the port and bayside also miami beach and the bed was amazing.......

[0.8274002075195312] Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business.
[0.714447021484375] Third, the entire hotel is a little run down.
[0.693389892578125] The hotel needs to seriously upgrade its rooms to be in par with other establishments.
[0.586517333984375] For me, it's the little details that make a hotel worth the money, and the Hilton just doesn't have the attention to detail that a hotel of its caliber should.
[0.5811920166015625] The reviews for the hotel were terrible.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9653205871582031] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.

[0.7739753723144531] Although the hotel was only a taxi drive away from south beach.
[0.730316162109375] Anyway if you have a car it takes 3 minutes to go to South Beach and it is better spend money for a good hotel in downtown compared to a fake design hotel in SOBE.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.674835205078125] I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel close to the Miami port and I would definitely stay here again.
[-0.67333984375] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[-0.6697540283203125] This hotel was booked for us through our travel agent - it was near the airport & near the port of Miami where we were leaving on a cruise.

[-0.7833328247070312] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace

[-0.9947776794433594] Car rental agency at location a plus.
[-0.9939384460449219] Another positive was the free internet service in the lobby (they had 3 computers you could use as well as wireless if you had a laptop) We were also able to avoid paying the $28 parking fee by parking across the street at a meter and then making sure we moved our car in the morning.
[-0.991703987121582] Checking was fine and the room view was outstanding...that's the good.
