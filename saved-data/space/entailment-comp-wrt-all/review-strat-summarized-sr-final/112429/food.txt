[-0.97509765625] The choice of channels for the tv is terrible....for the amount you pay this place you should get more than 20 channels....the only thing great about this place is the water pressure.

[-0.7403450012207031] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
