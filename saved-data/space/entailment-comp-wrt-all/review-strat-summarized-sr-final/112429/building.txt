[0.894317626953125] As always, parking in Seattle is a challenge, but worth putting up with for couple of nights to enjoy the holiday festivities.
[0.5891227722167969] It was rush hour, so the concierge had to stand out there quite a while to catch one that was empty.
[0.5263137817382812] Valet parking was terrible.
[0.44380950927734375] I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.
[0.174530029296875] The location is great (ten minute walk from Pike Place Market) but construction in and around the area means you're forced to use valet parking ($25/night).

[-0.8700294494628906] Very convenient when one does not want to hassle with a rental car.

[0.9621925354003906] The hotel is located near construction.
Parent: The rooms are clean and updated, but there is construction going on around the hotel that can be disruptive.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9621925354003906] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.
[0.8424530029296875] It is on the edge of downtown, with parking lots and demolition going on across the street on one side and the Hyatt on the other.
[0.761962890625] The location is great (ten minute walk from Pike Place Market) but construction in and around the area means you're forced to use valet parking ($25/night).
[0.6238021850585938] This hotel is 4 stars all the way, and in a fantastic location downtown.
[0.5873565673828125] A couple of cranes nearby with one of them directly over the hotel.

[0.21656036376953125] The man who was working at the front desk looked very gruff and mean, when I would ask something he made me feel like I was putting him out.
[0.0911712646484375] But I thought the staff were unprofessional and I was uncomfortable with the men at the desk.
[0.05865478515625] Restaurant staff was also very poor
[0.0395660400390625] He was very rude and would not let me use the phone to call other hotels for vacancies.

[0.17889404296875] The only aspect of the hotel that could be improved, in my opinion, is the fitness center -- it's in the basement and has older equipment.
[0.13605499267578125] The Paramount was one of the few hotels in downtown Seattle that I had not stayed in over the past 15 years.

[-0.9876413345336914] The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit.

[-0.9687590599060059] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.965113639831543] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !

[-0.512481689453125] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.
