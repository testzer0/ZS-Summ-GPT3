[0.50054931640625] This time a real maintenance person came and fixed it, but noone came to clean the floor like we requested.
[0.3313751220703125] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
[0.3206043243408203] Then coming back to the room tonight after being away from 8:30am to 8:30pm, the room had not been cleaned.
[0.27552032470703125] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.2508506774902344] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.

[0.7312660217285156] The front staff were not well versed in the local area.
[0.07711982727050781] Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge.
[0.0534515380859375] I do think this hotel is going to raise their rates and won't be worth it unless they pay attention to what guests on here are saying.

[-0.4420051574707031] Front desk was very helpful at recommending places and setting up car for pick up to airport, their town cars are cheaper than the taxis.

[0.3380889892578125] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
[0.02642822265625] One morning, it took us 45 minutes to get silverware to go with our breakfast.
