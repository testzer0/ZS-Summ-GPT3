[-0.9980580806732178] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.9980320930480957] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.9980225563049316] Stripping the sheets, I found a fairly fresh urine stain that made me want to vomit.
[-0.9969086647033691] The biggest issue is that upon going to bed the first night, I noticed an overpowering smell of urine in my bed.
[-0.9966769218444824] The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit.

[0.529388427734375] The rooms were too small.
Parent: Some guests said the rooms were small, while others praised the dark curtains.

----- Supporting -----

[0.529388427734375] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[0.1392974853515625] They did provide us with roll-away beds but then there was no room to move around in the room.
[0.111083984375] The bathroom is the size of a closet and the hot water took forever to warm up.
[0.0074558258056640625] This is a small place and they react quickly.
[0.0040073394775390625] The rooms for the price were not very good.

[0.15785980224609375] I would highly recommend it to anyone.
[0.1392822265625] The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review all the way around is that we could hear the person in the next room peeing.

[-0.9765396118164062] Ok, it is bad.
[-0.9730863571166992] PLEASE don't give this awful chain your business!
[-0.9453907012939453] They never did it.
[-0.9413919448852539] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[-0.9262962341308594] Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge.
