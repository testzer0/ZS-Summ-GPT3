[0.6718292236328125] The inside is very modern and sleek.
[0.45465087890625] From it's convenient location to the Dallas business hub for guests, to the captivating style of the hotel, to the impeccable service, this was the perfect place for my event.
[0.36407470703125] The hotel and guest rooms are cozy without feeling too small.
[0.358795166015625] It was incredibly trendy and modern without being intimidating and cold.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9850645065307617] This hotel has a very cramped feel.
[-0.9484939575195312] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[-0.9297943115234375] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.
[-0.8416976928710938] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.

[0.9490413665771484] The hotel is very posh and modern.
[0.9057369232177734] absolutely beautiful property, rooms are spacious and modern, roof-top pool area is excellent, and restaurant is 5-star.
[0.8964023590087891] Being it is very contemporary, be prepared for glass shower and toilet doors.
[0.8908805847167969] The Joule has a modern feel kind of like the W but it is warmer feeling and more comforatble than the W. The pool at the Joule is amazing and is actually where they film the outdoor bar scenes for ABC's The Deep End which is the show is set in LA but is actually filmed in Dallas.
[0.8765277862548828] Everything from the lobby to the rooftop pool has a very modern look.

[-0.9814949035644531] My guests were so intrigued by the history and architecture.
[-0.975860595703125] The roof top pool area is so romatic and the bartenders keep your glasses full.
