[0.7394847869873047] The hotel was not always clean.
Parent: The reviews were mixed on the cleanliness of the hotel, with some saying it was clean and others saying it was not.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7394847869873047] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[0.6078414916992188] if i had to nit pick i would say that a couple of lights switches and one of the phones did not work (ironic for a restored electric building) but in all honesty none of those defects affected our stay, which is probably why no one bothered to report them before; having said that a hotel of this stature should probably have better quality control so i still deducted one star from my rating.
[0.5056915283203125] It was almost as if the hotel lobby and elevators were wearing cologne and it was a good scent but I am a little sensitive to scents so it was a little strong for me but was nice when walking in from the street.
[0.4967460632324219] Designer soap in the bathroom does not a luxury hotel make.
[0.47247314453125] I suggest you take a look at the managment position as the pool ran out of Chardoney on Saturday night before 10pm and no one offered to go get us some more.

[0.9744148254394531] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
[0.8958053588867188] The hotel is gorgeous and our room was clean, modern, and just as I expected a Luxury Starwood Hotel should be.
[0.8287506103515625] I felt like we were in a clean and futuristic hotel.
[0.7447509765625] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".

[-0.9859371185302734] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.983607292175293] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.9741744995117188] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.9623889923095703] It needs to be removed ASAP.

[0.41934967041015625] It was insulting that the doorman/management were so disrespectful and unwilling to take care of their guest.
[0.39569091796875] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
