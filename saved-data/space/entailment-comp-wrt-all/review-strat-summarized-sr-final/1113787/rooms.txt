[0.8761253356933594] The rooms were adequate.
Parent: The reviews said that the rooms were adequate but overpriced, that the view from the room was not great, and that the gym was in need of an upgrade.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8761253356933594] The room was spacious enough, with a big glass wall on the outside, a 42" flat screen TV, and terrific lighting arrangements that allowed you to adjust the brightness in various parts of the room.
[0.8607330322265625] The standard rooms are nice enough Overall, this is a fantastic hotel and certainly one of the best in SPG in North America.
[0.8267440795898438] The beds were comfortable, the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were pleasant and quiet even though it was crowded for the UT/OU game.

[0.678955078125] The rooms were fantastic, very clean, and had awesome showers!!!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9640846252441406] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9640388488769531] It needs to be removed ASAP.
[-0.9601173400878906] The gym is in desperate need of an upgrade.
[-0.9317855834960938] Didn't really bother us because it was laid out well but if we had been there a number of days and spent them in the room, it would have gotten cramped.
[-0.9304046630859375] The rooms are astonishing, my favorite detail in the entire room was the lights that are built into the headboard.

[0.4897003173828125] The valet was very courteous (but very expensive at $27 a night) We had the King room on the 6th floor.
[0.4537086486816406] All in all, this hotel was nothing special with a high price tag.
[0.348846435546875] This hotel would have been adequate if the room price was much less.
[0.20209503173828125] Absolutely ridiculous service for any hotel let alone one u pay $300+ a night for.
[0.152374267578125] Valet was pricey, but much preferred over worrying about my car in one of the nearby parking lots overnight.

[-0.9843592643737793] i had a business conference in Dallas and was fortunate enough to get a discounted rate at the Joule for myself and a few colleagues.
[-0.9641256332397461] They upgraded us to a suite free of charge, brought in cupcakes, a special beer and were of ongoing assistance through out the stay, helping to make his birthday a great day and full of surprises.
[-0.9597749710083008] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[-0.9268865585327148] My stay at the Magnolia around the corner for the preceding two nights was far more pleasant for $150 less a night.
[-0.9055967330932617] They have a special lunch that includes a soup, salad and half sandwich that's quick and inexpensive.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7350311279296875] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.
[0.596527099609375] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
[0.49169921875] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[0.43780517578125] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[0.16569900512695312] Not great if you're trying to sleep in.

[-0.9928874969482422] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.9925374984741211] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[-0.9916391372680664] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
