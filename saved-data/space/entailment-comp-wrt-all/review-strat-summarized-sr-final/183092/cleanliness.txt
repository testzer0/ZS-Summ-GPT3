[0.5824737548828125] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[0.4672355651855469] The toilet did not flush properly and the shower seemed to have only 2 temperatures: scalding hot or freezing cold.

[0.7539100646972656] Great service, friendly staff, good food - pity the room wiater couldn't go further than the threshold !!!!
[0.373260498046875] I tried to hook up my computer to the internet in the room afterwards, but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue.
[0.18062973022460938] I was happy to get this hotel for $159/night - though internet was slow and added $16 dollars per day (though it included all calls - or so i thought until i got my bill and they had charged me $40 worth of long distance calls - they were promptly removed).
[0.0640869140625] i think this is a good value for the area except for the internet charges which were high for such a slow connection.
[0.04821586608886719] I was disappointed with the Internet service, though: $15 + $3 service charge daily, from noon to noon, with some interruptions.

[0.654296875] The rooms were clean, but when you looked closely, you would feel it needed a deep clean.. Ie around baseboards, walls and ceiling in bath, etc.
[0.5937347412109375] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.

[0.273345947265625] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.
