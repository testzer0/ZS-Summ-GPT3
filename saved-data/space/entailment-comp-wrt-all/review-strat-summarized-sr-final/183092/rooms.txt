[0.370758056640625] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.
[0.0693359375] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
