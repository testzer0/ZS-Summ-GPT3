[0.24759292602539062] Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.

[0.9593715667724609] The location was an excellent one for us because our event was just across the street, but we also walked to dinner on Queen Street, had many shopping choices (itâ€™s connected to the Eaton Centre, or you can meander along funky Queen West) and itâ€™s close to the subway.
