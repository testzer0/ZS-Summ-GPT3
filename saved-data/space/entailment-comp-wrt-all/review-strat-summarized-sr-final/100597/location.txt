[0.8247451782226562] If you are coming late and/or leaving early at Sea-Tac, this is not a bad choice.
[0.2837867736816406] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[0.23541259765625] Great for those early morning flights, and no worries about traffic jams as Seatac Airport is right across the street.
[0.2092132568359375] Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out.

[-0.886749267578125] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[-0.8392219543457031] ;) BAD: --YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PARK HERE.
[-0.8182601928710938] I was staying at the hotel for under 8 hours and yet the clerk who checked me in was still encouraging me to pay for the valet parking.
[-0.79278564453125] My only complaint is that they charge for the use of wifi in your room.
[-0.791748046875] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!

[0.47943115234375] The surrounding area is too noisy.
Parent: Some reviewers find the surrounding area to be noisy or "iffy," while others find it convenient for restaurants and transportation.

----- Supporting -----

[0.47943115234375] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.39258766174316406] We would not stay here again because of the noise and mildew.
[0.22906494140625] From reading others reviews I was not in the main towers, and only complaint was only being on the second floor someone was above me and from the sound they made walking must have weighed 400 pounds as it was very loud.
[0.2100677490234375] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[0.18454360961914062] --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
