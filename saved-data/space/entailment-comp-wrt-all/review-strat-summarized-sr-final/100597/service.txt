[0.5941505432128906] My wife really liked the Crabtree & Evelyn "Citron" toiletries; I liked the very comfortable bed and blackout curtains.
[0.5821075439453125] OUR overall stay was great, would have been nice to have no feathered pillows , not having a MICROWAVE,REFRIDG not cool, they charge each day for a roll away bed they said they would accomumdate for up to five in one room stayed three days so used blankets on the floor for the two boys I requested four blanket but had to go down to argue after only getting one they charge for wi-fi in room, LOBBY FREE- charge for daily parking no continuial breakfast without charging all these should change I called on phone for the entertainment book checking in nope they dont take it close to many places to eat,bank and even small cascino the airport close yes somewhat noisy but hey what one is not only during day time night time very quiet staff quiet friendly HOUSEKEEPING WONDERFUL yes i would recommend this hotel to others it'sa nice place is great for summer as with pool only on outsde .
[0.5687789916992188] We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.1555328369140625] I'm surprised at the negative reviews, I'm a regular Priceline customer, staying at the Doubletree usually once a month and have never had a bad experience.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9493122100830078] Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out.
[0.5908203125] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[0.5536994934082031] Confusing layout.
[0.462982177734375] If it wasn't for Pam the waitress quick actions and bringing me ice, I am sure it would have blistered terribly.
[0.44140625] The check-in was a bit slow, but when our turn came, I could understood why because the desk staff was incredibly friendly and determined to answer all of our questions--she was a very nice person.

[-0.9965295791625977] We experienced this poor attitude with a few other staff members within the hotel.
[-0.9959707260131836] No facilities were open early next morning when we were headed for our flight (surprising in such a location where there were lots of people headed for early flights) and although there seem to be a lot of valet staff around, none of them made any effort to assist.
[-0.9782047271728516] When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that.
[-0.9720001220703125] Waitress never brought the items we requested and the order was askew.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9241628646850586] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
[-0.8963279724121094] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[-0.8922195434570312] I took a taxi as everyone was trying to cram into the shuttle with no respect for first-come-first-served.
[-0.8881936073303223] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
[-0.8695487976074219] It was so liquified that it spilled all over my hand and burned me terribly.
