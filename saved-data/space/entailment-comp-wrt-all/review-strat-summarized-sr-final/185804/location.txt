[0.8707962036132812] I stayed here after all the rave reviews.
[0.8327960968017578] Feedback on the guest rooms from our out of town attendees was excellent.
[0.7551536560058594] We appreciated the favourable room rate we got because of the course at Maiwa that my wife was taking.
[0.6554679870605469] While at the hotel we hosted a dinner for 30 people in the Dockside and everybody that I spoke with raved about the dinner,even the locals who had never been there are very keen to come back.
[0.6252212524414062] I have stayed here on business, with Family and with friends and no one has ever been anything but totally impressed.

[-0.9966940879821777] In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.
[-0.9947772026062012] We held our wedding reception at the Hotel's lounge and found that we were overall very disappointed.
[-0.9941005706787109] We recently had an extremely bad stay at an American Sheraton hotel, and were a bit gunshy about staying in ANY hotel again...haha.
[-0.9923028945922852] My wife and I had a bad experience at GIH.
[-0.9727020263671875] They told us they thought it was a false alarm...Granville Island is a great place to visit w/kids - lots to do and a fun water park.

[0.9848873615264893] The hotel is well situated.
[0.9755439758300781] I love the location of this hotel!
[0.9725966453552246] I love the setting of this hotel.
[0.9681968688964844] This is not a five star hotel but you are not paying five star prices and as stated above the location is awesome.
[0.9657278060913086] The hotel itself was average plus, but as I mentioned the location nails it.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.3902587890625] If you're looking to stay at a big hi-rise in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown, then this place is not for you.
[-0.3890380859375] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.30973052978515625] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.2653045654296875] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.24744796752929688] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.

[0.9012508392333984] The hotel is located downtown.
Parent: The reviews were positive overall about the location of the hotel, with people praising its proximity to downtown, the water, and Vancouver's many attractions.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9012508392333984] The location is cool in that you're in the only hotel on the Island, everyone knows where to find it, and it's central in the city.
[0.878021240234375] Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market.
[0.8616065979003906] The hotel is nice, the restaurant is great, and it is really central.
[0.787109375] The biggest obivious attraction of this hotel is its location - smack dab in the middle of Granville Island, and therefore close to the restaurants, markets, shops, and galleries that are all nearby.
[0.5878524780273438] But if you spend very little time in the hotel, as we generally do, then it is just OK and sometimes even better than just OK when you look at the lights of downtown at night over the water.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9848899841308594] The location, although not downtown, was still great.
[-0.984100341796875] The Granville Island Hotel is a great little place to stay if you don't want the big city experience, and you like walking out your door to the marketplace, coffee shops, galleries and outdoor spaces that surround you on this interesting island.
[-0.9804649353027344] I discovered the fantastic European-influenced, waterfront, dog-friendly Granville Island Hotel and have been back every year for Christmas Eve through Boxing Day ever since (with one exception.)
[-0.9772396087646484] It's a calm, well-designed "boutique" hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island.
[-0.9740734100341797] on location - it is not downtown but across the water.

[0.9914121627807617] The hotel is located near the water.

[0.9914121627807617] The hotel is located as close to the water as you can get without falling in.
[0.9887800216674805] The hotel is located right on the water.
[0.9874463081359863] The hotel is right on the water (harbor) with a direct view of the hi-rises of Vancouver.
[0.9539585113525391] Attached to the hotel is a great little patio restaurant by the water's edge (when weather permits) and a bar/restaurant inside with a mico-brewery.

[-0.9510917663574219] The market itself is so interesting and the food is wonderful.
[-0.9510478973388672] Basically a food market and some specialist shops.
[-0.9355525970458984] I especially enjoyed the Public Market.
[-0.926300048828125] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.
[-0.9094123840332031] It's a really cool market.

[0.9750232696533203] The hotel is located near Vancouver's attractions.
Parent: The reviews were positive overall about the location of the hotel, with people praising its proximity to downtown, the water, and Vancouver's many attractions.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9750232696533203] Those small issues aside, this is a lovely hotel in a great area, close to the attractions of Vancouver yet far enough away to provide solace.
[0.8461875915527344] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[0.8190155029296875] The hotel is right on the water (harbor) with a direct view of the hi-rises of Vancouver.
[0.7162246704101562] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.

[-0.6918411254882812] granville island is a community in itself.
[-0.63555908203125] The island itself is lovely to wander around, and each day we bought either breakfast or a picnic lunch at the market.
[-0.5888290405273438] Basically a food market and some specialist shops.
[-0.499664306640625] The island is also super for kids with the kids market and a free water park.
[-0.4875335693359375] Granville Island is actually a little peninsula (more like a giant pier) with a very laid back feel to it, complete with a down-home fresh foods market, like something you would see in the movies.

[0.9147529602050781] The location was difficult to access.
Parent: Some people found the location difficult to access, but most people thought it was a good location for taking public transportation or sightseeing bus tours around the city.

[0.9147529602050781] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[0.7309112548828125] The place is a bit confusing to drive into at night if you're unfamiliar with the area, but my GPS showed the way.
[0.7191085815429688] Although the hotel has parking for a daily fee, it is best not to bring your car as the island is definitely best seen on foot and driving on the island is difficult as pedestrians are everywhere.
[0.590667724609375] Not the easiest to get to, but once you arrive you are set for the rest of your visit.
[0.456390380859375] It was very hard to leave.

[-0.9954228401184082] Right in the heart of Granville Island to make it really easy to explore.

[-0.9947738647460938] The hotel is not far from the Aqua Bus, taxis, and the Granville Island Public Market making it easy to get around.

[0.470550537109375] All the major sight-seeing bus tours stop just a couple of minutes walk away as does public transport.
[0.451507568359375] If you want to visit downtown just take the water taxi or "aqua bus" these little boats are fun, not very expensive and the quickest way to gt there.
[0.3350372314453125] Took Aquabus back via Science World, live theatre on Granville island, great exploring all over the island - shops, food market, craftspeople and artists.
[0.30462646484375] This hotel is located close enough to downtown to walk to in 1/2 hour( using the aquabus to cross the channel) but also very close to local interesting sites on granville island and is a 15 min walk to Broadway St and 4th Ave where there are numerous placed to eat.
[0.17450904846191406] Staying on Granville Island you can walk to the public market every morning and you're just a bus ride into downtown.

[-0.7895374298095703] Just somewhere to sleep.
[-0.7694015502929688] There is plenty of pathway to take a romantic walk around the island (on the water) and to observe water traffic.
[-0.7175445556640625] It was a bottle of wine with a miniature tuxedo jacket around the bottle.
[-0.7106819152832031] you can set off on serious walks or just hang out and watch the local water scene.
[-0.6208610534667969] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
