[-0.823333740234375] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.
[-0.7910919189453125] Food isnt great but you are right by the market.

[0.9610404968261719] The portions are too small.
Parent: However, there are complaints about the small portions, high prices, and slow service.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9610404968261719] As I said the rooms are too small for all that furniture.
[0.8727550506591797] The rooms are incredibly small.
[0.8618240356445312] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.
[0.7704315185546875] The room was so tiny we could hardly fit in it.
[0.5482864379882812] The rooms are quite small, which was a little tight with two kids and my wife and me.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9755129814147949] The restuarant in the hotel is quite nice and despite its "brewery" designation is much more of a full menu than you might expect.

[-0.9710788726806641] Big rooms with lots of windows.

[0.7302742004394531] The prices are too high.
Parent: However, there are complaints about the small portions, high prices, and slow service.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7302742004394531] It was an acceptable hotel, but definitely not worth the outlandish price.
[0.70965576171875] * Way over priced and not the price I had booked online Overall this is a good choice for the location and if it is within your budget, just don't expect too much.
[0.1253204345703125] Granville Island was a little too touristy for me.
[0.09723091125488281] In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.
[0.084381103515625] I probably wouldn't eat there though if I was paying for it myself as the menu was pretty expensive and there are several great places to eat elsewhere on the Island.

[-0.995297908782959] The hotel itself is reasonably priced, has very open meeting rooms with doors directly outside.
[-0.994708776473999] If you want to visit downtown just take the water taxi or "aqua bus" these little boats are fun, not very expensive and the quickest way to gt there.

[0.39202880859375] The bar was really nice and I spent a nice couple hours there on a sunny afternoon enjoying a slow pint.
[0.34588623046875] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[0.137451171875] Unfortunately they just don't have the level of service that would make them a great hotel.
[0.07802963256835938] I didn't spend much time actually at the hotel so my interaction with staff was limited as well.
[0.0592803955078125] The room was quiet and we did not notice any noise from "neighbors".

Parent: The hotel is conveniently located near the Public Market, where there are a variety of food options.

[0.9611101150512695] Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market.
[0.9408445358276367] The hotel is not far from the Aqua Bus, taxis, and the Granville Island Public Market making it easy to get around.
[0.9307594299316406] The best part of the hotel is being able to walk to the Public Market where you can find everything you need to prepare a wonderful meal (like a picnic with wine, cheese, bread, fruits, meats, etc) or you could just eat at the many food stalls.
[0.7632408142089844] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[0.7312774658203125] The Granville Island Hotel is a great little place to stay if you don't want the big city experience, and you like walking out your door to the marketplace, coffee shops, galleries and outdoor spaces that surround you on this interesting island.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7453641891479492] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.7195281982421875] The hotel is located right on the water.
[-0.5466537475585938] Being on the sea wall makes it safe and impossible to get lost.
[-0.51031494140625] The hotel is located as close to the water as you can get without falling in.
[-0.4792938232421875] I would not recommend this to my friends or family.

[0.5551910400390625] you could easily spend most of your time there since there are lots of restaurants and a fantastic public market featuring lots of food.

[-0.5906562805175781] We were told none were available.
[-0.5210170745849609] so that when we bought food to bring back to the room, we had nothing to eat it with.
[-0.4008636474609375] Just somewhere to sleep.
[-0.28363037109375] Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc.
