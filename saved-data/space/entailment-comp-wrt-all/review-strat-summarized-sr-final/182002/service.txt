[0.8618698120117188] At check out the couple ahead of me had a bad experience with the management but the young fellow at the desk handled it with such grace that I wanted to applaud him.
[0.8436508178710938] I was impressed however that after voicing my concerns, the manager spoke with the parents and the child stopped playing.
[0.8320121765136719] I am thankful however to the manager of the hotel, who when he heard our plight, assisted us with contacting the local police and filing a report.
[0.7720718383789062] And when Rowena at the front desk gave us the wrong room (a double room instead of the king we had reserved 6 months before) the first thing she said when we immediately came back down was "did you take anything out of the room?"
[0.660064697265625] One even apologized for the front desk staff's negative behaviour over the 3 night's stay.

[0.6638526916503906] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.
[0.530517578125] The Wi-Fi service in the room was undependable, the 40+ kgb reception would suddenly drop to 1Kgb and unuseable, then it would flip up to perhaps 18 kbs and back to 1 kgb.
[0.34623146057128906] They at least lent us an external wifi card but it still didn't work.
[0.07273101806640625] The wireless Internet, while free, is not even worth that price.

[0.9922981262207031] My other reason for choosing this hotel was the fact that they have free wireless internet access which was much needed.
[0.9693870544433594] This is a decent hotel, but factor in the low prices, great location and little perks like free wi-fi, and I'd say that it's one of the best I've stayed in.

[0.6157627105712891] The two main things I did apprieciate was, the free wireless internet, and the fact there was a Tim hortons right in the lobby.
