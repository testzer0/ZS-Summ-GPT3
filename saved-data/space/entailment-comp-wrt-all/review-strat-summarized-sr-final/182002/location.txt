[0.3251380920410156] The area around the hotel is not safe.
Parent: However, the area around the hotel can be a bit seedy.

----- Supporting -----

[0.3251380920410156] the pool area is scarily dirty, full with pigeons, so you might want to skip this offering to stay well.
[0.3233451843261719] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.
[0.320831298828125] A tip to all travelers â€“ doesnâ€™t matter where you go or where you stay, there are people out there who are thieves..any traveling we will do now will ensure that our valuables are left in the hotel safe and we wear a money belt.
[0.20794677734375] Don't stay at this hotel unless you like slow (and possibly unsafe) elevators, flaky wireless Internet, and poor customer service.
[0.1817455291748047] The hotel was dirty.

[0.8519115447998047] The underground parking is difficult to navigate.
Parent: The underground parking is also not very easy to navigate.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8519115447998047] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.49188232421875] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.38867950439453125] Its really tight down there, but there is also a public lot outside which you can use.
[0.35699462890625] It is worth noting that the parking garage has very little clearance, and some of the tightest turns I have ever had to negotiate.
[0.33306884765625] To get to the parking lot from the guest floors you will need to use an access card in the elevators; if you are not quick enough, or your card doesn't work properly, you will find that you are called to another floor.
