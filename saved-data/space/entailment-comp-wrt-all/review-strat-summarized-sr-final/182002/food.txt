[0.24937820434570312] At check out the couple ahead of me had a bad experience with the management but the young fellow at the desk handled it with such grace that I wanted to applaud him.
[0.20574188232421875] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.19207000732421875] i was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews but we were very pleased with the hotel.

[0.4931182861328125] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).

[0.7025146484375] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
[0.6881160736083984] Room was BIG, bed was comfy, had an a good size fridge in it too and it's the first hotel I've been to in a while where the internet was free and fast.
[0.6796379089355469] Had daily continental or hot breakfast for an unreasonable cost for the 'menu' - try the local restaurants or delivery) Overall, reasonable cost for duration; comfortable, quiet, clean rooms; and you receive Best Western Club points or Airmiles for your stay.
[0.4815521240234375] there's an in-house tim hortons in case you don't want the very affordable breakfast buffet.
[0.4520454406738281] The staff at checkin was quick to notice our children were a little fussy and provided crayons and coloring books that calmed them right down, The room was huge complete with microwave and small fridge so we could warm up left over which is always important travelling with kids.

[-0.9819869995117188] We are huge fans of their breakfast menu but there were only a few choices available- very few muffins and bagels.
[-0.9526939392089844] This is not to complain about Tim Hortons in any way, but were were dissapointed of the "limited" menu they have had there.
[-0.925689697265625] There was a 'restaurant' that never did open the three days, two nights we stayed and no room service.
[-0.8558216094970703] I would describe it as typical Best Western standard 3 star hotel quality, nothing special and no frills.
[-0.8522853851318359] No Breakfast sandwiches for meat lovers like myself.
