[-0.9965219497680664] When we first arrived, our first impression was, great and when we got into the room it was even better as we had a fridge, microwave & Tea & Coffee facilities (We did how ever pay extra for this pleasure of about Â£1 a day.)

[0.9909467697143555] The property though was not nice at all.
[0.8356781005859375] Although this is by no means a luxurious residence, it is a perfect place to stay if you are intending to visit the theme parks, although a car is essential.
[0.7645492553710938] THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.
[0.7557907104492188] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.
[0.7418251037597656] It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!

[-0.9926319122314453] We had a very nice stay.
[-0.9916858673095703] The pool is GREAT open from 10am to 10pm , very good after a long day at the parks , and its HEATED at night!
[-0.9915361404418945] The hotel itself was great!!
[-0.9912753105163574] the best theme park we visited!
[-0.9908103942871094] This was our 5th visit to Orlando and our first budget trip and i have to say that this little gem of a hotel is far superior to other more expensive ones in the area.

[0.6529541015625] This hotel is far from florida mall , with no shuttle service there .
[0.0780792236328125] I'm pretty sure they gave us this hotel so we can compare the 5 star accomadation to this dirty location.
[0.04193115234375] In short don't expect a flash, fancy place but do expect somewhere cosy to get your head down at night that's clean and friendly.
[0.03521728515625] No place to lounge.
[0.01760101318359375] AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!

[-0.9987719058990479] Its really close to everything in Disney....
[-0.9987201690673828] There are also a lot of gift shops, miniature golfs etc, so there's plenty to keep everyone amused.
[-0.9986660480499268] The good...the place was close to the main entrance to Disney and lots of food choices nearby to eat.
[-0.9986376762390137] The location is superb - close to restaurants, supermarkets and Disney.
[-0.9985663890838623] I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.

[0.5898323059082031] The hotel is too expensive.
Parent: They also said that the hotel is expensive, and that it is difficult to travel around on foot.

[0.5898323059082031] I think the holiday company are really ripping folk of with what they charge if you get this hotel.
[0.39862060546875] The hotel refused to match multiple lower rates I had found elsewhere, so I decided to cancel due to unhelpful reservation services and reserve a hotel I KNOW has superior customer service.
[0.33935546875] And you will want to cancel when you learn there are superior area hotels who match lower advertised rates.
[0.23822021484375] Hotel shop is very expensive so be warned.
[0.06890869140625] we stayed here in feb 2009 , take no notice of negative reviews , for wot you pay you cant grumble ,the rooms are big enough for my wife and 2 teenage girls , they were cleaned and beds were made every day, soap etc replaced daily .

[-0.9971187114715576] If you want a cheap, comfortable and clean motel as a base to visit Disney and Universal this is first class.
[-0.9969949722290039] The location to Disney is ideal & for the amount of time spent in your room I find this hotel ideal, at a bargain price.
[-0.9960603713989258] We booked with first choice and this seems to be there most budget hotel.............if you want better you'll have to pay for it i suppose, We wanted a cheap base to enjoy the local attractions but with that we also got a nice comfortable hotel room in a nice quiet area and everything was fineeeeeeeee.
[-0.9958944320678711] I booked this hotel as it was cheapest available.
[-0.9950461387634277] 3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .

[0.9155654907226562] A must is a car because travelling around on foot is hard the roads are really hard to cross you take your life into your own hands and wait up to 15 mins for the lights to change and watch the traffic from the right because while your crossing they are too.
[0.36818695068359375] We would have struggled without the hire car so I would advise you to get one!
[0.34442138671875] It's not the best location as you do need to drive everywhere but that was all part of the fun for us!!
[0.257843017578125] You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.

[-0.9616689682006836] It was pretty easy to get around to good restaurants and stores.
[-0.92828369140625] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
[-0.9278182983398438] There are so many great eateries around, and you don't even need the car to get to most of them!!
