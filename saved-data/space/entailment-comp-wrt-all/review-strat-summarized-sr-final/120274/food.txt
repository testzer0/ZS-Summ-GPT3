[0.9693307876586914] The food at the hotel was not impressive.
Parent: Overall, reviewers were not impressed with the food at the hotel.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9693307876586914] Never ate breakfast at the hotel because it was somewhat underwhelming so had breakfast in our room and we would drive to McDonalds to get our morning coffee.
[0.83624267578125] The breakfast was decent - not as good as I've had at other hotels, but it was free so one shouldn't complain :) The location is awesome, about 15 minutes to Disney and almost within walking distance from some nice restaurants.
[0.7225265502929688] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[0.6458263397216797] I would not recommend this hotel really - it is very basic, so is the breakfast
[0.6097793579101562] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.

[0.6935806274414062] Not much, but you have to bring a quarter to fill your ice-bucket, annoying if you don't know this and have to walk back to your room to find change.
[0.652679443359375] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.

[0.0708770751953125] Like some other reviewers have stated, there are a couple of shortcomings...the "Continental Breakfast" is stale bread, lousy toasters, cereal, coffee and orange juice.
[0.02187347412109375] Its not worth it!!!
[0.017124176025390625] Our only negatives points were the breakfast was very poor.

[0.858180046081543] We never used the hotel for breakfast as there are so many cheap places to eat.
[0.7544403076171875] Cheap hol allocated on arrival, location very good for all parks using the I-4 also if you don't want to drive out to eat, excellent restaraunts opposite hotel (be careful crossing the road) including TGI FRI, Red Lobster, Italian, Subway, Steak House as well as fast foods and Internet cafe.
[0.6638946533203125] To solve this problem we went to the supermarket across the road and paid two pounds for a polystyrene one, filled it with ice from the motel and away you go!!
[0.6175384521484375] On a better note... the hotel is in a good location and just down the road is a cafe thing where you can get an all you can eat buffet breakfast for very cheap, which served loads of fruit, cakes, a fry up, pretty much anything.
[0.5264053344726562] We did not have breakfast here and went over the road where there was all u can eat at Sizzlers for $3.99.
