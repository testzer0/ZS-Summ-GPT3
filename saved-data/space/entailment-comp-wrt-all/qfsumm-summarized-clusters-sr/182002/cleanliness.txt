[0.9448699951171875] The Wi-Fi service in the room was unreliable.
Parent: The Wi - Fi service in the room was undependable , the 40 + kgb reception would suddenly drop to 1Kgb and unuseable , then it would flip up to perhaps 18 kbs and back to 1 kgb .

[0.9027795791625977] There aren't many facilities and the internet in my room cut out once in a while.
[0.8427505493164062] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.

[0.4093017578125] This sentence is confusing and does not appear to be a value judgement.

[0.4093017578125] Beware of what looks like a continental breakfast as it is not nor are there any signs indicating charge.
[0.3118438720703125] The front desk operator made me feel like it was a nuicence for him to switch my room.
[0.25763702392578125] They did not allow us to use the laundry because we were not students (no sense to me).
[0.2360992431640625] Despite our best efforts to convey how irreplaceable it was, housekeeping claimed not to have seen it.
[0.2244873046875] When I complained about the elevators and wireless he just stood there with no apology or good explanation other than it would be too expensive to fix the elevators and it was all the guests' fault anyway for the elevator getting stuck since there were 8 people in the elevator (it's rated for 12 people).

[0.8988056182861328] We have never been to Canada before or to a huge city like Toronto, we found it very easy to get around, Primrose hotel is an excellent location as the subway is only 5min walk way .There is a lot of restaurants , bars, stores ,drugmarts and shops within walking distance also Dundas sq , Eaton centre &hockey Hall of Fame are close by.
