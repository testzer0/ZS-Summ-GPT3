[0.5449542999267578] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[0.35414886474609375] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.33323097229003906] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.0382080078125] Afterwards the Manager acknowledged that the lifts are in need of urgent replacement but due to the cost this has yet to be authorised.

[0.47515869140625] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.
[0.080322265625] The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service.
[0.076904296875] The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage.
[0.060577392578125] For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not.
