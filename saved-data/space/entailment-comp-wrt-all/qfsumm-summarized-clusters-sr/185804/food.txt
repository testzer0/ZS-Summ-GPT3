[0.47956275939941406] The Granville Island Hotel is a great little place to stay if you don't want the big city experience, and you like walking out your door to the marketplace, coffee shops, galleries and outdoor spaces that surround you on this interesting island.

[-0.9939600229263306] It was a fun, informative, and flexible way to view the entire city.
[-0.9937248229980469] That took us to downtown, Yaletown, the Science centre, the Space museum... and then we just walked.
[-0.9842891693115234] After living in Vancouver for several years, then coming back to visit, we found this hotel gave us an entirely different perspective of the city - one that we fully appreciated!
[-0.983396053314209] A short seabus trip across to Hornby Street took us to downtown for $2.50pp.
[-0.9769906997680664] Our only real disappontment was when we walked around Gastown, which really seems to have got shabby since our last visit.
