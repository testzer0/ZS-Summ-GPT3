[-0.9959259033203125] The staff just seemed disinterested, especially at the bar and the front desk.
[-0.9550895690917969] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
[-0.9536504745483398] Unfortunately they just don't have the level of service that would make them a great hotel.
[-0.9372553825378418] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.

[-0.9959316253662109] That being said, my room was only okay.
[-0.9888515472412109] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.987457275390625] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!
[-0.9791808128356934] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.

[-0.9964513778686523] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[-0.9958200454711914] For old times sake, we even had lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory, but the food wasn't very good, so we decided to give the city a miss and pootle around the Island instead .

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9938316345214844] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.9793243408203125] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
[-0.8627052307128906] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.8274984359741211] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.8077239990234375] The only reason I did not give it 5 out of 5 stars is because of its location.

[0.9753532409667969] We requested the "non-view" category.

[0.0335693359375] Overall seems to be a part of life for Vancouver residents so you're not stuck looking at crowds of unattractive tourists.
[0.012725830078125] Didn't try out the pool.
[0.0032958984375] We didn't even turn on either of the two TV's while there - we just sat and looked out the window at the ever changing scenery.

[0.9819655418395996] There was a small balcony and we could see the water and boats both from our window and the balcony.
[0.9434871673583984] We also sat on the balcony of our room to watch the boats go by and enjoy the view.
[0.9317970275878906] The end room is great because even though it's small, 2 walls are window-sliders to balconies overlooking ritzy boats and water traffic.
[0.9153900146484375] The rooms are large, each with a small balcony and most have a view of the water.

[0.0222930908203125] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[0.021297454833984375] As it was misty and a bit rainy that day they offered us the use of an umbrella which made our walk around the area much more pleasant.
[0.017669677734375] We arrived on a rainy Thursday day to be greeted by a very friendly staff.

[-0.9973196983337402] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.94451904296875] That view is killer, and with two decks with which to view it!
[-0.9047775268554688] The only drawback could be room size as ours was only just adequate and the view was rather restricted.
[-0.8361396789550781] And the most annoying: the room lighting is poor, in particular the reading light.

[0.01917552947998047] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!
[0.01412200927734375] In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.
