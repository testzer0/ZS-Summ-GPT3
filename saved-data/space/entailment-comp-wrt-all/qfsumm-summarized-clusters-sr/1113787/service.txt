[-0.9869632720947266] Cons: Service is terrible!!
[-0.9828357696533203] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[-0.98040771484375] Biggest issue was when we picked up our car from the valet parking.
[-0.9685764312744141] I know this could happen anywhere but in years of valet parking it hasnt so this was quite annoying.

[-0.9980039596557617] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
