[0.86383056640625] My kids especially liked the drapes the separated the bedroom from the bathroom area.
[0.062744140625] other than that the bathroom is not very private so if you want to preserve the "romance" factor you'll need to make a trip to the lobby because the ballroom level restroom is kept locked.
[0.0439453125] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.03314208984375] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!

[-0.8483047485351562] At first, I did not want to eat at the restaurant.
[-0.84661865234375] Admittedly the open bathroom concept may not suit a lot of people so be aware â€¢ Food â€“ Charlie Palmer is a very very good restaurant.
[-0.8335494995117188] The bathroom was beautiful with a large soaking tub, a shower room and excellent lighting.

[-0.8442840576171875] The pool is small but they keep it very cool and refreshing.
[-0.8176651000976562] We used the house car, a Cadillac Escalade which took us around, nice touch but the car wasnt as clean as it should have been and the driver didnt seem like he wanted to take us.

[-0.3497352600097656] It needs to be removed ASAP.
[-0.27742767333984375] I find that very unproffessional as a manager not to be stocked or offer to go get what the customer is requesting.
[-0.26078033447265625] As an order of french toast was around $20 I decided to walk down the street (out the front, down one block to left, take a left and Seven Eleven was on the right) and get a donut and some milk.
