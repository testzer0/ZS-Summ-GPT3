[0.9848532676696777] The hotel is close to the CN Tower.
Parent: This hotel is in walking distance to most of the downtown attractions such as the CN Tower , Queen St , Front St , even Wayne Gretzky 's restaurant is right down the street .

----- Supporting -----

[0.9848532676696777] The Hotel location is excellent, near the CN Tower and many other attractions.
[0.9603443145751953] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.

[0.9523162841796875] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.9146499633789062] Perfect location (CN tower and Rogers Centre just a short walk from the hotel).

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8277626037597656] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[-0.8190231323242188] Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.
[-0.7575225830078125] With regards to the nightclub next door.
[-0.7446823120117188] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[-0.709991455078125] Only a 5 minute walk to the Rogers Centre where we watched the Blue Jays.

[0.8604393005371094] Its my new favorite place to stay, you can walk to the Eatons center quite fast and of course Queen St is even closer.
[0.8349075317382812] We found the best street to walk - Queen Street & it's just a few short blocks from the hotel.
[0.751220703125] Love this hotel, great location ... if you're a group of young people looking for nightlife and shopping (Queen West is right there with a bunch of stores, Chinatown and Kensington is walking distance), definitely give this hotel a shot!
[0.682403564453125] Nice walk down Blue Jays way to harbour area, left out of hotel to great shops on Queen Street.

[-0.9783401489257812] Right out of hotel and then left on to King St brings you to a great row of bars and restaurants - I recommend Verona italian!
[-0.9741096496582031] I have stayed at this Hilton Garden on Peter street on business many, many times-so when planning a weekend visit with the family I had no hesitation to book- Its well situated, clean and modern and generally a very good value and the Hhnonors perks are good- WOW what a difference during the weekend-instead of business folk and tourists-its packed with club kids and partyers-the staff do their best-but its noisy and the area around the hotel is pretty crazy late in the evening on weekends- I will stay again during the week-but never on a weekend
[-0.9723892211914062] Spent the Thanksgiving weekend at the Hilton Garden Inn on Peter St. A lovely, clean, modern hotel downtown.
[-0.971466064453125] I went to The Hilton Garden Inn on Peter Street for a one night stay with my BF to celebrate our Anniversary, we opted for the King Room with Jacuzzi and Fireplace.
[-0.9559249877929688] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.

[0.487518310546875] It was a bit of a walk to central downtown, but the low price for a hotel room as nice as the larger downtown hotels I have stayed in was well worth it.

[-0.9913125038146973] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[-0.9912328720092773] I think the valet parking at the hotel is around the same amount and you can take your car in and out as needed.

[-0.9248924255371094] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.
[-0.9210395812988281] There was a business centre, gym and pool, all of which were high quality.
