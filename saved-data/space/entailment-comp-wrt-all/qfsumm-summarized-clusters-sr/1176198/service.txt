[0.496002197265625] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
[0.3753662109375] We trusted them to be honest and they were not.
[0.356170654296875] OK, I love music, but this was no music !
[0.3006591796875] My only complaint about the room was the Wi-Fi...terrible signal from it and half the time (at least) I couldn't even get on the internet.
[0.2867431640625] I was there the morning of the false fire alarm and although it was annoying I would rather it be false than for real!

[0.6348876953125] I suggest you ask for a room on a high floor as there is a noisy club South of the hotel on the ground floor.
[0.5960693359375] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.
