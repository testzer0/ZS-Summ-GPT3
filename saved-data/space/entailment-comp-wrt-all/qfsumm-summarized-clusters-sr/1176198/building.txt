[-0.9148139953613281] Hotel rooms and restaurant = great "Valet" = brutal and ruined the whole stay.
[-0.9038810729980469] I truly disliked the bed.
[-0.8998203277587891] That was a bit of a pain, but understandable, because it was getting extremely rowdy and it was clear people were bringing in about 10 people into one room.
[-0.8882617950439453] This night was a bit of a mess; we would walk out to the hallway and smell weed, hear loud music blasting, etc.
[-0.8789176940917969] I would NOT recommend giving this hotel your business.

[0.289398193359375] Parking rates are high as you will find in all major cities around the world.
[0.2798919677734375] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
[0.2738037109375] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.
[0.2447357177734375] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
