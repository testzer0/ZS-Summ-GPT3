[-0.9874470233917236] The best included the cleanliness, the attention to detail with lighting and electrical outlets, the comfortable furniture, the robes, the great shower, the refrigerator, the windows can open, the wide and well lit hallways (although too warm) and of course an excellent king bed.
[-0.982933521270752] The best part was the bed.
[-0.9795682430267334] I especially liked the Japanese restaurant attached to this hotel (not sure if it is part of the hotel), but it is open late and has a very well priced happy hour and late night happy hour.
