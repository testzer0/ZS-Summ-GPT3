----- Weakening -----

[-0.76959228515625] Another positive was the free internet service in the lobby (they had 3 computers you could use as well as wireless if you had a laptop) We were also able to avoid paying the $28 parking fee by parking across the street at a meter and then making sure we moved our car in the morning.

[-0.5255126953125] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!

[-0.44903564453125] Everything there were great from the nice clean and comfortable room with the unbelievable pretty view until the good food, the great bar and pool etc and last but not least the helpful friendly and sympathetic staff especially the ladjh in the little shop and the men called fernando at the front desk, he'd done a well work, gave good advices and was very cordially,smart, professional with a nice charisma and left behind a positive impression!
