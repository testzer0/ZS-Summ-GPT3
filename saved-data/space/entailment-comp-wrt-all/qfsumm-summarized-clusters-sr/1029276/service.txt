Parent: Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler .

[0.824920654296875] So the hotel - fine, for the cost, if you have to be downtown, it's an OK choice.
[0.69610595703125] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[0.656982421875] Nice hotel no real complaints.
[0.4004831314086914] The rooms are ok. Clean, quiet at night and good beds.

[0.50390625] This hotel is best suited for the folks who want a decent place to stay when working in downtown Miami or are going to catch a cruise.
[0.2783660888671875] Traveled to Miami in January for business and stayed at the Hilton Downtown because the conference was being held at the same hotel.
[0.245361328125] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[0.243560791015625] The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun.

[-0.9107933044433594] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.
[-0.837371826171875] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace
[-0.6916866302490234] The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace.
[-0.6567840576171875] Too many hobos and drug addicts!!!
[-0.638153076171875] Phone - don't go near it.

[0.7810592651367188] One issue with the executive lounge access - hotel literature stated the lounge should have been open from 6.00 am - this was not the case and when we arrived on one occasion to grab breakfast before leaving for the day we were told to "try later lounge not opening yet staff had not arrived".

[0.8037147521972656] We finally spoke to one front desk manager who compensated us for one nights stay because of our troubles.
[0.7090339660644531] At first they took us to an unready room which was disappointing but after a short wait they took us to a really big room with a great harbor scene as an apology to the mess.
