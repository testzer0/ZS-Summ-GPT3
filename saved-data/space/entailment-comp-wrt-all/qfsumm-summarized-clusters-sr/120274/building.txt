[0.773101806640625] you do get a free breakfast every morning but get there early if you want a seat as space is limited , the hotel has got a free shuttle to parks , but we had a car as this is much easier in florida .
[0.42694091796875] A free bus was provided to the parks but we just used our car.
[0.3697662353515625] This hotel is far from florida mall , with no shuttle service there .

[-0.9783077239990234] We didn't have a car so it worked with the shuttle to the parks (although it took a really long time!)

[0.6712722778320312] You walk on the carpet just feels so sticky.. About the location, compared to the other on celebrations area, seems not so close to those theme parks.
[0.3438720703125] I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.
[0.30066490173339844] The bedding was torn and my feet kept getting caught in the holes.
[0.175933837890625] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.

[0.439849853515625] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.33980560302734375] Cheap hol allocated on arrival, location very good for all parks using the I-4 also if you don't want to drive out to eat, excellent restaraunts opposite hotel (be careful crossing the road) including TGI FRI, Red Lobster, Italian, Subway, Steak House as well as fast foods and Internet cafe.
[0.24237060546875] You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.
