[-0.9698700904846191] During our recent trip we stayed in 5 hotels in Canada and this was by far the worst.
[-0.9693508148193359] It was a nice hotel, but I would recommend staying closer to the center of activities.
[-0.9501934051513672] My only negative comment about the room was the view - it looked straight into an adjacent office building.
[-0.9362192153930664] It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.
[-0.9354496002197266] I was so frustrated.

[0.9758195877075195] The location is central.
Parent: The reviews say that the location is perfect, central, and close to everything.

[0.9758195877075195] Great location, very central.
[0.9733433723449707] The location of this hotel is excellent â€“ very central and close to public transport, shopping, restaurants, etc.
[0.9545888900756836] location very central for downtown.
[0.9345283508300781] Stayed for three nights as a family, couldn't be more central for all the downtown attractions, everything's within walking distance and the hotel is connected by a walkway to the Eaton Centre.
[0.9325523376464844] The location is in downtown, so it's in the heart of things, but you have a fair number of homeless people and transients around.

[-0.9818840026855469] The location is reasonable but quite a long way from the waterfront.
[-0.70697021484375] It was a nice hotel, but I would recommend staying closer to the center of activities.
[-0.5725173950195312] My only negative comment about the room was the view - it looked straight into an adjacent office building.
[-0.5705642700195312] The room I had was at the end of the hall, so it was exceptionally quiet, and the bed was great.
[-0.5701904296875] Some of the rooms can be far from the elevators.

[0.9847588539123535] Perfect location close to everything.
[0.9749321937561035] The location is perfect, near everything one might need on a business trip and for doing some shopping.
[0.9274682998657227] Right downtown, close to everything!
[0.8835582733154297] Everything needed is within walking distance, but public transportation is just as accessible.
[0.8802337646484375] The Downtown Marriot is good for exploring the city since everything is within walking distance (if you do not mind to walk a bit across a city which I think is the best way to get the vibe of a city).

[-0.9965047836303711] The location is reasonable but quite a long way from the waterfront.
[-0.9904499053955078] Some of the rooms can be far from the elevators.
[-0.9777297973632812] This makes it an ideal location for vacationers, but a bit far if you have meetings in the main business district in the downtown core (although it's not too bad for that).
[-0.967864990234375] The beds at the Marriot were SO comfortable I would have been ok with just lounging in bed all weekend and never seeing the rest of city!
[-0.9670019149780273] Again i treid to explain that i didn't really want to walk- especially in my situation and if the shoppers was not open for certain.
