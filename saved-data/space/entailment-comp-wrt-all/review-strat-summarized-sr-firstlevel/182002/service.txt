[0.8673076629638672] My experience at this hotel was the worst I've ever experience within the service industry.
[0.39125823974609375] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.3571319580078125] 1) Rude staff at the front desk (only one of the employees we dealt with were nice); 2) Restaurant only open part of the time; 3) They DID give us a bigger and cheaper parking space out behind the building because our SUV wouldn't fit in the underground parking, but there were junkies hanging around at that parking lot; 3) FOUND A BEDBUG IN THE BATHROOM SINK (ALIVE) -- 'NUFF SAID!
