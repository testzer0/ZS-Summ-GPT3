[-0.9935703277587891] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[-0.9879226684570312] This was one of the worst experiences I have ever with a hotel room that cost $160 a night.

[-0.9831924438476562] Although it would have been more convenient for me to stay at the hotel the meeting was in, their prices were far too expensive for my budget.
