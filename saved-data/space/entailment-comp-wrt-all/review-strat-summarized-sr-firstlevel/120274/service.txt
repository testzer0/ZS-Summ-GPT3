----- Supporting -----

[0.8916893005371094] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
[0.59503173828125] 3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .
[0.2085113525390625] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
[0.175750732421875] The bad..the AC unit ran for one minute and shut off for three...all night long.
[0.16925048828125] THE GOOD....Fast Check-in,Close to Disney, Free pool towels, Clean, safe pool, Easy walking distance to restraunts, Free basic breakfast THE BAD....Air-con was loud and slow, paper thin walls, not enough cupboard space, poor decor, small bathroom, no porter, Unreliable and not enough park transfers, Bad smells in room.

[-0.8791885375976562] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
[-0.7566051483154297] The housekeeping couldn't have been more helpful .

[0.8942356109619141] My biggest complaint was the lack of internet service.
[0.6936912536621094] They do advertise free wifi, but in reality, you have to be in the lobby and even then it doesn't work very well.
[0.51483154296875] The wireless internet--somewhat annoying to have to go to the lobby, since it doesn't reach to the rooms.
[0.11444091796875] If it is this hard to get something accomplished over the phone its obvious customer service is not a priority at this property and i will be too tired to deal with anything less than quality customer service upon my arrival.

Parent: However, some reviewers found the internet service to be lacking, and others thought that the shuttle service could be improved.

----- Supporting -----

[0.310302734375] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
[0.29229736328125] THE GOOD....Fast Check-in,Close to Disney, Free pool towels, Clean, safe pool, Easy walking distance to restraunts, Free basic breakfast THE BAD....Air-con was loud and slow, paper thin walls, not enough cupboard space, poor decor, small bathroom, no porter, Unreliable and not enough park transfers, Bad smells in room.
[0.2484283447265625] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....

[-0.9926929473876953] Firstly we could not find the hotel, we needed to go a bit further down on the 192 than we were doing but when we finally got we got checked in very quickly, be warned the reception staff are very rude and unhelpful!!
[-0.9890403747558594] The manager on duty was unfriendly and didn't even offer help, until he finally called the police.
[-0.9829483032226562] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.
[-0.9727458953857422] his hotel was had very disappointing customer service and staff.
[-0.969573974609375] Firstly, reception won't really care as we found them quite surely and unhelpful, and secondly the rooms are not gleaming and smelling of rose petals!

Parent: Guests felt safe and welcome at the hotel.

[0.5563201904296875] It was cleaned everyday, the safe was free (bonus) and the beds were the most comfortablist (?)
[0.5205392837524414] The rooms were clean and secure and housekeeping looked after us well.
[0.50714111328125] We were booked at the hotel as part of a package deal so had no choice on where we were staying and from reading the previous reviews were quite worried but we certainly didn't encounter any issues with vermin in the rooms.
[0.4117889404296875] We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.
[0.3902873992919922] Our room was cleaned daily, fresh bedding every day, the room was bug free and we had no proplems whatsoever and would have no hesitation about staying at this location again.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9937324523925781] I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!
[-0.9864959716796875] This hotel has a serious bed bug problem and they are not willing to take care of the issue.
[-0.9862747192382812] First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.
[-0.9838113784790039] We had planned to stay for 6 days, however, we got robbed half an hour after check in.
[-0.9829521179199219] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.

[-0.9852066040039062] It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!
[-0.9850082397460938] The manager on duty was unfriendly and didn't even offer help, until he finally called the police.
[-0.9838142395019531] Bottom line - do yourself a favor: NEVER STAY at this flea bag of a hotel.

[0.829437255859375] The shuttle service was reliable.
Parent: The shuttle service was reliable, and the air conditioning was effective.

----- Supporting -----

[0.829437255859375] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
[0.7798690795898438] The shuttle service (free) was on time (give or take 10 mins) to the theme parks.
[0.217742919921875] We didn't want to drive so we relied on these and they took ages and were in a very bed condition.
[0.1455230712890625] I was quite worried after reading the reviews, but as we got a really good deal stoppping there for 2 weeks, we thought if it is that bad we could always find somewhere else, luckly it was fine and stopped there for 2 weeks.
[0.09099197387695312] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9587631225585938] 3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .
[-0.8929595947265625] THE GOOD....Fast Check-in,Close to Disney, Free pool towels, Clean, safe pool, Easy walking distance to restraunts, Free basic breakfast THE BAD....Air-con was loud and slow, paper thin walls, not enough cupboard space, poor decor, small bathroom, no porter, Unreliable and not enough park transfers, Bad smells in room.
[-0.8770523071289062] It was very clean and our room was ok. the staff were very freindly and the only bad report that we have is with the shuttle busses.
[-0.8541231155395508] We did not receive anything from them except an awful time.
[-0.827362060546875] Don't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney!
