[0.131011962890625] The hotel is too close to a busy road.
Parent: However, some guests found the hotel to be too close to a busy road and were bothered by the constant pestering from the ticket stand to sell them a timeshare.

----- Supporting -----

[0.131011962890625] It is located on 192 which is close to everything which is nice but I would say to stay somewhere else, somewhere with basic amenities for the same budget price.
[0.051025390625] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.0107421875] It's not the best location as you do need to drive everywhere but that was all part of the fun for us!!
[0.002666473388671875] There are plenty of other hotels down the same stretch in an equally good/better location so my advice is to chose them and not stay at the quality inn!

[0.9848127365112305] There was plently of parking and the first room they put us in was clean and tidy, however a bit dark.
[0.97772216796875] Ample parking and the rooms were promptly made up each day.
[0.31451416015625] The parking lot was clean, the location of the hotel was GREAT (right next to many restaraunts, souvenier shops, and within 5 minutes to the Disnet World Parks).
[0.28076171875] I loved that it did include: free parking, pool, laundry facility, free wireless, and free shuttle.
[0.064056396484375] The location is a little out the way for Universal, Prime Outlets (formerly Beltz), I Drive etc but it's only 5 minutes from Disney, you can see the top of Expedition Everest from the car park at the back!!

[-0.9810962677001953] THE GOOD....Fast Check-in,Close to Disney, Free pool towels, Clean, safe pool, Easy walking distance to restraunts, Free basic breakfast THE BAD....Air-con was loud and slow, paper thin walls, not enough cupboard space, poor decor, small bathroom, no porter, Unreliable and not enough park transfers, Bad smells in room.
[-0.9622631072998047] One day, the bus was so overcrowded that i would say it was very dangerous (approx 40 people standing in the centre isle).
[-0.9597721099853516] You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.
[-0.9521369934082031] Pool area cleaned daily again basic could do with some new furniture have to cross small parking lot to access, towels available daily from reception minimal charge.
[-0.951263427734375] The only issue i had with the transfers were that they were overcrowded.

[0.8000469207763672] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....

[0.8413772583007812] Upon arrival, we had to pay an additional "resort fee" of 97c per room per day, which covered the safe and pool usage etc, but having paid only £19 per room per night, we didn't really complain at that.
[0.64947509765625] It is good value for money although you have to pay a small amenities charge on top of your reservation cost.
[0.42254638671875] Upon arriving at the motel I was asked to pay the resort fee which I knew about and indeed most of the motels charge this or charge you for the safe in your room which amounts to around the same thing.
[0.40899658203125] over $12.00 was added to our room bill due to the "free local calls".
[0.24603271484375] When we first arrived, our first impression was, great and when we got into the room it was even better as we had a fridge, microwave & Tea & Coffee facilities (We did how ever pay extra for this pleasure of about £1 a day.)
