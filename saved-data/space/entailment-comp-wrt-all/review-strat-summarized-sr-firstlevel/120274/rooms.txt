[-0.9974918365478516] All in all i would stay there again but would request having a fridge as all of the rooms do not have them and the ice machine played up alot.
[-0.9974393844604492] I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!
[-0.9945907592773438] The fridge and microwave are not available in 'standard' rooms.

[-0.9937095642089844] Firstly we could not find the hotel, we needed to go a bit further down on the 192 than we were doing but when we finally got we got checked in very quickly, be warned the reception staff are very rude and unhelpful!!

[-0.9906978607177734] When it was brought to their attention the front desk people were very rude about the problem and the maintence man tried telling us they were "sugar ants" We were promised several different things just so we would not report them to the health department or write a review.
[-0.9740447998046875] Reception staff were not the friendliest but did suggest having 3rd (top) floor room to prevent any noise from above.

[0.5511684417724609] I have read some bad reviews of this hotel and do not agree we stayed here in october this year and would go back every year it was clean and had everything we wanted on site the staff were always helpful and room was always clean early in the day so if we went back for lunch it was alrewady done the hotel is in the perfect spot near disney and good easy place to get to the malls and shops i didnt find one bad thing about this hotel it was perfect
[0.5238494873046875] The hotel is well situated for all the theme parks especially the Disney parks and there are plenty of shops and other attractions in the local area.
[0.516815185546875] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
[0.49013328552246094] The parking lot was clean, the location of the hotel was GREAT (right next to many restaraunts, souvenier shops, and within 5 minutes to the Disnet World Parks).

[-0.9767446517944336] You walk on the carpet just feels so sticky.. About the location, compared to the other on celebrations area, seems not so close to those theme parks.
[-0.9751608371734619] Bottom line - do yourself a favor: NEVER STAY at this flea bag of a hotel.
[-0.9557790756225586] AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!
[-0.9475975036621094] This hotel is far from florida mall , with no shuttle service there .
[-0.9381923675537109] A hidden treasure of small shops with amusement rides that I didn't even know about ( I only drove by it over a dozen times) and it's mostly free!
