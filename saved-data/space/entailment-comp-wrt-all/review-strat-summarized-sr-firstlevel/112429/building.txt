[0.9678287506103516] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.
[0.9526195526123047] The hotel was under exterior renovations, but that worked out for me as I was out of my room for most of the day.
[0.3936767578125] The hotel has gone through some renovations which make it look nice, Dragonfish changed their menu a bit but their food is still good.
[0.3914794921875] The hotel since I last stayed had gone through a nice renovation.
[0.28131866455078125] Rooms are currently being refurnished with new furniture.

[0.634246826171875] Lots of daytime noise due to the construction.
[0.5665779113769531] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[0.3452949523925781] The only thing was that there was construction going on right across the street that woke us up before 9am on a Monday morning.
[0.27959442138671875] The weight machines are so packed together that you can't really move the weights.
[0.22177505493164062] The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.93963623046875] Laid back, nonintrusive hotel suitable for business or vacation stays, centrally located on Pine--3 blocks from Westlake, a block from the bus terminal ($2.75 airport transfers), and a block from Von's Martini and Manhattan Shrine, never to be missed.
[-0.9340114593505859] The Paramount is understated- the lobby is small and cozy and the location, while close to everything downtown, is subtly placed.
[-0.90985107421875] Great location for conventions and an easy walk into the heart of downtown.
[-0.902409553527832] Easy access to everything.

[0.6793060302734375] Front desk personnel are somewhat "aloof".
[0.4830818176269531] The man who was working at the front desk looked very gruff and mean, when I would ask something he made me feel like I was putting him out.
[0.143829345703125] Restaurant staff was also very poor
[0.12328529357910156] But I thought the staff were unprofessional and I was uncomfortable with the men at the desk.
[0.08202552795410156] Not to mention when I checked in they yelled my room number out to me, not a good idea as a female travelling alone...

[-0.9916620254516602] Everyone was very friendly, and eager to pass on maps, coupons and recommendations for the local area.

[0.17889404296875] The only aspect of the hotel that could be improved, in my opinion, is the fitness center -- it's in the basement and has older equipment.
[0.13605499267578125] The Paramount was one of the few hotels in downtown Seattle that I had not stayed in over the past 15 years.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9614677429199219] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.9422416687011719] The room is shabby, the shower made a horrible noise whenever the water was running.
[-0.9343729019165039] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.9334068298339844] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[-0.9312934875488281] Don't take a room on the inside unless you want to be awakened by the garbage trucks at 5am.

[-0.5157127380371094] Ok, it is bad.
[-0.5147247314453125] Now on to the bad, the other staff.
[-0.512481689453125] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.
