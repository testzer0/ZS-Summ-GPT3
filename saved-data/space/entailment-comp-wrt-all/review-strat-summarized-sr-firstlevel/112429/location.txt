[0.345947265625] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !

[0.9515256881713867] Overall a good hotel very convenient for shopping.
[0.9486169815063477] This hotel is conveniently located in downtown Seattle.
[0.9367609024047852] The hotel is particularly convenient for those attending events at the Convention Center.

[-0.9786014556884766] I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.
[-0.8977203369140625] Don't take a room on the inside unless you want to be awakened by the garbage trucks at 5am.
[-0.8720436096191406] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
[-0.8277359008789062] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.8249664306640625] Based on my overall experience I could not recommend this hotel.

[0.42624664306640625] It's in the heart of the downtown from which you can walk to Seattle Center or Pike Place Market and the water, or go a couple of blocks to public transport (monorail to Seattle Center, light rail to/from airport, bus to Museum of Flight).

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9668388366699219] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.7604284286499023] It is on the edge of downtown, with parking lots and demolition going on across the street on one side and the Hyatt on the other.
[-0.6462936401367188] A long walk back up hill from Pike Place Market to the hotel.
[-0.6374263763427734] On this last stay, I was assigned a corner room which had great views but, because of having two windows and being on the corner of a busy street, was also a bit noisier (sirens, etc.)
[-0.6081724166870117] This is a small place and they react quickly.

[0.7780685424804688] The hotel offers valet parking.
Parent: The only downside is the valet parking.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7780685424804688] Getting my car from the valet took less than three minutes... My stay at the Paramount was a very pleasant and positive experience.
[0.7751998901367188] The location is great (ten minute walk from Pike Place Market) but construction in and around the area means you're forced to use valet parking ($25/night).
[0.626007080078125] The cleaning staff is very friendly; the frontdesk staff and valets are OK.
[0.478515625] There was an online special of $129/night, which included valet parking.

[-0.69879150390625] When we talked to the front desk, they told us they contract out their parking (United Parking) and referred us to the supervisor of the company.
[-0.6071395874023438] The weight machines are so packed together that you can't really move the weights.
[-0.5735015869140625] My desk chair was broken and I asked for it to be replaced or fixed.
[-0.50909423828125] They never did it.
