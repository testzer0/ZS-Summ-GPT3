[0.6365203857421875] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[0.2274932861328125] The room is shabby, the shower made a horrible noise whenever the water was running.
[0.189361572265625] The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit.
[0.1665802001953125] The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.
[0.14774322509765625] Don't take a room on the inside unless you want to be awakened by the garbage trucks at 5am.

[0.5219879150390625] It was a wonderful hotel, but not intimidating or snobbish.

[0.31500244140625] The treadmills were ok but the ellyptical machines were bad.

[0.254730224609375] On this last stay, I was assigned a corner room which had great views but, because of having two windows and being on the corner of a busy street, was also a bit noisier (sirens, etc.)

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9950642585754395] We were very pleased when we got to our room- quite spacious with a king bed that honestly gave us such a great sleep that we meant to ask the front desk about the mattress brand and bedding.

[0.2645683288574219] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
[0.16913604736328125] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.13336181640625] This time a real maintenance person came and fixed it, but noone came to clean the floor like we requested.
