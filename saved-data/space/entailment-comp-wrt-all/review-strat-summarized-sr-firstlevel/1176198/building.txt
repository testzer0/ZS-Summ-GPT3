Parent: They appreciated the indoor pool and gym facilities, and found the location to be convenient.

[0.9597091674804688] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
[0.9173517227172852] The rooms are in excellent condition, housekeeping is very good, and the location is very handy to everything downtown.
[0.8956031799316406] The hotel is very conveniently located in downtown Toronto and overall the stay was very satisfactory for the price.
[0.8914308547973633] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.
[0.8913345336914062] The hotel is close enough to the big attractions to be convenient but still is not in an overly busy/loud part of town which was nice.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8868923187255859] We were extremely inconvenienced (mother in law in hospital).
[-0.8386917114257812] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[-0.8216133117675781] my boyfriend and i both went home sore and dead tired from trying to find a comfortable way to sleep tossing and turning all night but there was none.
[-0.7565212249755859] Try not to get a room on that side, even high up.
[-0.6659927368164062] That was a bit of a pain, but understandable, because it was getting extremely rowdy and it was clear people were bringing in about 10 people into one room.

[0.020673751831054688] We took them, but when went up, one of the rooms only had one bed and no couch!!

[0.771728515625] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[0.735626220703125] I stayed here on business and can definitely say that it has all the basic things required by a business traveller; iron, hairdryer, in room safe, free wi-fi etc.
[0.445465087890625] Nice facilityin a convenient location, very useful business services room, friendly restaurant staff (though the honeydew melon in the salad bar was off).
[0.212646484375] How about a sign that states this at the front desk so we don't waste our time changing and taking off all of our makeup!
[0.198150634765625] The mini-fridge and microwave were very handy.

[0.5407752990722656] My husband is confined to a wheelchair and we really appreciated the extra effort the valets took helping us remove the chair from the car, assemble it, get my husband into it and get us into the hotel.
[0.522186279296875] We really enjoyed our stay here, it is in good location in the Entertainment district, and though we didn't try the restauant or breakfast it looked very good!
[0.5166454315185547] We love this hotel.It is clean and beautiful.The staff treat you like friends.It is so centrally located that you can access downtown Toronto at its best.You are in walking distance to everything.We will be staying here again for sure.
[0.4007759094238281] By far the best thing about our stay was the breakfast, we got a great deal as part of our booking through an external site (total $300 inc tax), if bought at the hotel it's around $15.
[0.3988380432128906] Would definitely stay here again when we go to our next Jays game!

[0.15198516845703125] It was a very noisy Saturday night as there was lots of partying going on in the streets till 3 or 4 in the morning and we could hear it loud and clear.
[0.09444427490234375] Cons: Saturday night was very noisy-- club on street just below the hotel had noise that was heard even on my upper floor room with windows closed.
[0.063934326171875] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.05999755859375] From the 17th floor we could be awakened from the thump thump of the disco music at 3am on a Saturday night !
