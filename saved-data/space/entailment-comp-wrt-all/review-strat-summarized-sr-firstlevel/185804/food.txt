[-0.9528908729553223] I didn't have any meals at the hotel so can't comment on that.
[-0.94940185546875] The hotel restaurant was fine, not great.
[-0.9443511962890625] The hotel restaurant merits only 3*, with slightly above average food (also expensive) .

[0.9817376136779785] The hotel provides some wonderful views of the harbour and the rooms are modern and clean.
[0.9559116363525391] Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
[0.9521284103393555] Most everything else about the hotel was great as well - the size of our room, the friendly staff, a great dinner and breakfast, again with outstanding views from the dining room.
[0.9424386024475098] The hotel setting is very nice with water and dock views.
[0.9188728332519531] The Granville Island Hotel allows you to view it from one of the best locations in Vancouver ... Granville Island.

[-0.9820556640625] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.8978042602539062] My rating would have been 5 stars, except the room was quite small for two people 5 days, and the only view was over a roof and hvac unit.
[-0.7914886474609375] The only drawback could be room size as ours was only just adequate and the view was rather restricted.
[-0.6325540542602539] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.538330078125] The restaurant also has a terrific view and the people were very nice.

[0.9264516830444336] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.
[0.46724700927734375] They served everything from made-to-order Eggs Benedict to fruit and pastries to salmon and bacon and fresh-made waffles and...
[0.4343862533569336] The mini bar was stocked sufficiently with a wide variety of refreshments and snacks.
[0.3593254089355469] The food is excellent ( both room service and in the resto) and they have a micro brewery on site.
[0.325225830078125] There are plenty of paths to jog and walk around the water, and lots of choices for dinner and drinks.

[-0.9878883361816406] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[-0.9328384399414062] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.

[0.3737678527832031] Granville Island is actually a little peninsula (more like a giant pier) with a very laid back feel to it, complete with a down-home fresh foods market, like something you would see in the movies.
[0.3022003173828125] There are several shops and plenty of excellent places to eat FRESH seafood, including the Dockside Restaurant and pub (microbrew).
