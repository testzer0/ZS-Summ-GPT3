[-0.9911985397338867] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.
[-0.9891147613525391] The room also had a weird smell.
[-0.9868545532226562] It is a mash up of 80s smoked glass and more recent upgrades and pseudo renovations.
[-0.98681640625] * The doors, wallpaper and carpets need to be redone.
[-0.9860458374023438] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).

[-0.9747371673583984] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.970245361328125] Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc.
[-0.9685382843017578] And the most annoying: the room lighting is poor, in particular the reading light.

[0.90496826171875] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[0.5842247009277344] The service from employees is always professional and courteous, the room is extremely clean, the restaurant food is good and the view is impeccable.
[0.30767822265625] The room itself was clean, the bathroom was very modern, and the views of the water/harbor were very pretty.
[0.27655029296875] As they say there "No worries", because you could duck in and out of the little shops and galleries without getting too wet, and when a real downpour came as we were dressed up and heading into the city, we were offered a huge umbrella by the staff, which we kept until check out.
[0.2644157409667969] It's in a perfect location, it's been recently updated, it's very clean, it has a lovely patio to enjoy the views from, it's located on Granville Island with it's many charming spots to shop, dine and enjoy the fabulous farmers market, it really couldn't be better.

[-0.9708671569824219] Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling.
[-0.9392671585083008] The room also had a weird smell.
[-0.9370574951171875] Oh, and the sauna was broken.
[-0.9353561401367188] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
[-0.9200973510742188] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.

Parent: The reviews said that the hotel was clean, although the decor and furnishings were a little dated.

[0.776066780090332] Its a bit old and some of the furnishings and fabrics in the room showed their age, but its clean and quiet and the mattress was comfortable.
[0.7060070037841797] The rooms are fairly well equipped, and on the surface look good, however the fittings when you look closely at them are not top quality, and will not last.
[0.6883125305175781] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[0.6789455413818359] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[0.37803173065185547] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.

[0.2111053466796875] This is a great hotel and obviously a favorite with discerning locals having events...they weren't really an obstruction to our having a great time, but did become something of a joke as both the hotel and adjoining park/marina/galleries are dripping with wedding parties.
[0.11844253540039062] The hotel's lobby was undergoing renovations at the time but it never created any issues with our stay.
[0.08303070068359375] you could easily spend most of your time there since there are lots of restaurants and a fantastic public market featuring lots of food.
