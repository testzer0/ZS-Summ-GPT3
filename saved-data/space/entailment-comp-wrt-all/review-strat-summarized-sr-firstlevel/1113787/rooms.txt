[0.9408416748046875] The bathrooms were excellent.
Parent: The bathrooms were clean and top notch, with the sink area being separate from the bath and toilet.

[0.9408416748046875] There was a complimentary bottle of water, and toiletries were top notch.
[0.931828498840332] Best Bathroom Amenities I have ever used ...
[0.9141950607299805] The rooms were fantastic, very clean, and had awesome showers!!!
[0.9040441513061523] High quality toiletries.
[0.83074951171875] The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious and luxurious with all the amenities you could ask for.

[-0.9639987945556641] I wasn't crazy about the way the bathroom is a bit open to the room.
[-0.9482917785644531] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.9309921264648438] Admittedly the open bathroom concept may not suit a lot of people so be aware â€¢ Food â€“ Charlie Palmer is a very very good restaurant.
[-0.9192409515380859] It needs to be removed ASAP.
[-0.9050140380859375] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.

[0.594696044921875] The bath and toilet were divided into two separate rooms, and the sink area was separate.
[0.014617919921875] other than that the bathroom is not very private so if you want to preserve the "romance" factor you'll need to make a trip to the lobby because the ballroom level restroom is kept locked.

[0.0014324188232421875] Just one downside.
[0.0] The pool!

[-0.821990966796875] the hotel has an excellent in house restaurant with plenty on the menu and delectable choices.
[-0.802215576171875] At first, I did not want to eat at the restaurant.
[-0.78997802734375] We ate at the restaurant before we were going to go out and the food was amazing and the service was second to none.
[-0.779998779296875] Location is good, there are lots of restaurant options nearby.
[-0.77825927734375] You must lay by the gorgeous pool as well.

Parent: The Penthouse Suite was especially beautiful, with great views of downtown Dallas.

[0.38873291015625] The Joule is an absolute Jewel.
[0.360595703125] The master bedroom was beautiful, comfortable and had great views of downtown Dallas.
[0.16497802734375] The roof top pool area is so romatic and the bartenders keep your glasses full.
[0.132080078125] The roof top pool was like a spa and even though it was 102 degrees, it felt very comfortable because of the fans and the misting system.
[0.100189208984375] The POOL scene is incredible on the roof!

[-0.9255962371826172] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[-0.8002204895019531] I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.
[-0.7988319396972656] to get ONE sandwhich I had to call and ck on it and there are slow and the service is so bad and the managers know which makes it WORSE...
[-0.7813072204589844] The gym is okay, but somewhat small.
[-0.7527117729187012] I have stayed in hotels all over world and this was one of the worst experiences, and that is rating this hotel against much cheaper ones.

[0.04052734375] An Infinity pool hangs over Main Street providing for a unique panorama of downtown Dallas.

[0.035511016845703125] I will hopefully be back -- as the revitalized Main St. has a lot of action on the weekends and this hotel sits right in the middle!

[-0.965756893157959] You get no view .
[-0.9357337951660156] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.
[-0.8163485527038574] Maybe I just had a bad experience but I was throughly disappointed in this hotel.
[-0.7822132110595703] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[-0.7026538848876953] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
