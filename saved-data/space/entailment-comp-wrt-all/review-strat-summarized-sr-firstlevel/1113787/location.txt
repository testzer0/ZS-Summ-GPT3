[0.8590011596679688] The room was spacious enough, with a big glass wall on the outside, a 42" flat screen TV, and terrific lighting arrangements that allowed you to adjust the brightness in various parts of the room.
[0.6679000854492188] The hotel and guest rooms are cozy without feeling too small.
[0.46926116943359375] absolutely beautiful property, rooms are spacious and modern, roof-top pool area is excellent, and restaurant is 5-star.
[0.238311767578125] The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious and luxurious with all the amenities you could ask for.

[-0.9826745986938477] The gym is in desperate need of an upgrade.
[-0.9621162414550781] Would ask for room on another floor next time.
[-0.9568557739257812] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9330501556396484] This hotel has a very cramped feel.
[-0.9254074096679688] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.

[0.198028564453125] We wish the weather had been warmer so we could have tried out the pool.
[0.09136962890625] The doorman refused to allow us entry and we ended up waiting for almost an hour in the Texas heat while other folks would simply walk off the street and were immediately allowed in!
[0.083709716796875] After such a long and sweltering wait, the b-day girl's guests began to just leave out of frustration.
[0.07598876953125] I had a rather loud banging on my door to find a maid who said (Who spoke little english) 'downturn you have ice".

[-0.9945688247680664] The rooms were fantastic, very clean, and had awesome showers!!!
[-0.9941320419311523] We reserved a guest room which was beautiful and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast on the patio Saturday morning at Charlie Palmer's Restaurant.
[-0.9934206008911133] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.
[-0.9932870864868164] Besides the carpet being a damp when we arrived it was perfect!

[0.66351318359375] The pool was too chilly for the kids to spend much time in it, but that isn't surprising for this time of year.
[0.048553466796875] We stayed in one of the lofts and initially had some temperature issues but they were addressed quickly.
[0.0448760986328125] Well it started off BAD within 10 mins we had went to the pool where we find about 5 young ladies workin and just stood there looking like we where not even there, so I was like excuse me can I get a drink.

[-0.9868330955505371] We especially enjoyed our time at the pool, and Todd made the weekend so much more fun!
[-0.9833383560180664] Fun pool atmosphere!
[-0.9795684814453125] The roof top pool was like a spa and even though it was 102 degrees, it felt very comfortable because of the fans and the misting system.
[-0.9765009880065918] Swam at the pool on the roof one day and had breakfast in the restaurant.
[-0.9764723777770996] The pool was amazing as well, met a lot of nice couples on my stay, everyone was very laid back and had a great time!

Parent: The location of the hotel is not the best, but it is close to some good restaurants.

[0.9677467346191406] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[0.2700233459472656] It might be where the young people of Texas go to spend their money on dinner and drinks in the bar but its not the place to stay overnight.
[0.18889617919921875] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[0.18097305297851562] Not great if you're trying to sleep in.
[0.17599868774414062] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.

[-0.9561128616333008] Loved that the desk was behind the headboard - clever use of space!
[-0.9548282623291016] I agree with one reviewer that the outside club noise was a bit excessive, but that's the price for the great locale!

[0.9106359481811523] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[0.724278450012207] The convenient location of The Joule allowed us to choose from a variety of restaurants.
[0.3612327575683594] Puts you in the heart of Dallas close to great dining, nightlife, shopping and culture.
