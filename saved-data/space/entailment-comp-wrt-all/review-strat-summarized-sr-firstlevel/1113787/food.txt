[-0.8067474365234375] Since the squid and quail eggs on their menu did not sound good, one of our group walked across the street to order some Food and bring it over.
[-0.4254875183105469] I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.

[-0.97027587890625] We had dinner at Nobu which is in Crescent Court which was really good too.
[-0.9437084197998047] Furthermore, room service was closed at 10 pm, front desk was unhelpful (in ordering a pizza nonetheless) and Charlie Palmer was a waste of time and energy (great staff, HORRIBLE management.)

[-0.8816661834716797] It really ruined the experience for me.
