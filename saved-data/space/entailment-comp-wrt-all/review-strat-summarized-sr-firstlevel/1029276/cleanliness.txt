[0.8939208984375] The reception area is not on the ground floor.
Parent: Check-in was easy, though its a little funky getting to the reception area as you have to take an elevator up a floor, but not a big deal.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8939208984375] But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking.
[0.8469696044921875] The executive lounge is in the 16th floor (also a great view!)
[0.8356094360351562] Ä±t has an interesting entrance you take a lift to 3 floor above to enter the lobby from the valet service but still not tiring.
[0.827117919921875] The main lobby was not actually on the second floor - confusing.
[0.779815673828125] The staff were friendly and helpful, and the lobby and bars downstairs were very relaxing and we did spend alot of time there.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.6265869140625] And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor.

[0.5849456787109375] Not impressed.
[0.579925537109375] for the price, it's OK, nothing more.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9967188835144043] What an ordeal.
[-0.9961791038513184] Really abusive.
[-0.9951019287109375] Air conditioning noise is horrendous.
[-0.9930410385131836] What I got was beyond what I expected - I was stuffed to the brim.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9955644607543945] On the way to my room someone had dropped 3 beers on the floor and it was wet and sticky with the cans still there and a wet floor sign in the middle.
[-0.9947257041931152] Tools and debris were lying on the balcony.
[-0.9916238784790039] A huge group of teenagers were staying in the hotel, and kids were all over the place until late at night...flooding the lobby, elevators, and public space.
[-0.9880828857421875] The elevator dinged all night long keeping up the entire family.
[-0.9875011444091797] My opinion is that this motel was extremely unorganized during this time.
