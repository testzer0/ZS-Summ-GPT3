----- Weakening -----

[-0.9833087921142578] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.976715087890625] The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all".
[-0.9584579467773438] Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff.
[-0.9509086608886719] This time the clerk did manage a sorry, but it was forced.
[-0.9398880004882812] other issues- bathroom really not that nice, concierge horrible at recommending things to do or good resutarants or giving directions.
