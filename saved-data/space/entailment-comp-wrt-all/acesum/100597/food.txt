----- Weakening -----

[-0.9938483238220215] I was disappointed to learn there was a fee for parking ($16+tax), a fee for Internet ($5 for one hour), no simple breakfast included.
[-0.9859447479248047] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[-0.981781005859375] There is no complimentary breakfast; there is a coffee shop and an espresso bar that also sells yogurt, bagels and pastries.
[-0.9677209854125977] Coffee shop service was horrible.
[-0.9438929557800293] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
