----- Weakening -----

[-0.9761295318603516] The staff just seemed disinterested, especially at the bar and the front desk.
[-0.91143798828125] Initially they were less than courteous about it but i said if there is a charge of course i would play however it might be helpful for future guests to be escorted to the bike and given a brief safety instruction prior to giving someone a key.
[-0.8555374145507812] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.

[-0.7143735885620117] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
