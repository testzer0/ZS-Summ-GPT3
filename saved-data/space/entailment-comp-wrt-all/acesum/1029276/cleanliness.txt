----- Weakening -----

[-0.9915533065795898] On the way to my room someone had dropped 3 beers on the floor and it was wet and sticky with the cans still there and a wet floor sign in the middle.
[-0.9897165298461914] A huge group of teenagers were staying in the hotel, and kids were all over the place until late at night...flooding the lobby, elevators, and public space.
[-0.9882135391235352] Tools and debris were lying on the balcony.
[-0.9850616455078125] My opinion is that this motel was extremely unorganized during this time.
[-0.9840545654296875] They also did an extremely lousy job in cleaning the room.
