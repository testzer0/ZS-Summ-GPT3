----- Weakening -----

[-0.9874429702758789] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.
[-0.9782991409301758] Try not to get a room on that side, even high up.
[-0.9429655075073242] Unfortunately, we made the wrong decision on where to stay.
[-0.8911962509155273] I would NOT recommend giving this hotel your business.
[-0.8656330108642578] my boyfriend and i both went home sore and dead tired from trying to find a comfortable way to sleep tossing and turning all night but there was none.
