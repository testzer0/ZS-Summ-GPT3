[0.9841318130493164] I would recommend this hotel to anyone; it is clean, luxurious and has out of this world service.
[0.9498939514160156] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
[0.8985443115234375] The hotel is gorgeous and our room was clean, modern, and just as I expected a Luxury Starwood Hotel should be.
[0.7686920166015625] The clean lines and technically savvy components of the guest rooms ensure that you remain at ease and connected while you travel.
[0.759979248046875] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9819011688232422] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[-0.9734973907470703] I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
[-0.9659519195556641] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.9556789398193359] It needs to be removed ASAP.
[-0.944122314453125] It was almost as if the hotel lobby and elevators were wearing cologne and it was a good scent but I am a little sensitive to scents so it was a little strong for me but was nice when walking in from the street.
