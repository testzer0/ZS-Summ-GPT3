[0.9792270660400391] The breakfast was ok. My kids loved the waffles though... And if you are planning on having breakfast, as a tip, come early!!!
[0.9582605361938477] the continental breakfast was ok also.
[0.9574394226074219] We had the breakfast 1 day which was okay - but got really busy, we prefered to go out for breakfast to the Ponderosa which is just up the road.
[0.9574222564697266] The breakfast was decent - not as good as I've had at other hotels, but it was free so one shouldn't complain :) The location is awesome, about 15 minutes to Disney and almost within walking distance from some nice restaurants.
[0.9524517059326172] Continental breakfast was a little boring, could use more variety, but it was ok none the less.

[-0.994232177734375] Breakfast was terrible, cleaning was very average.
[-0.9877738952636719] Worst "free" breakfast I have ever had.
[-0.9823989868164062] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[-0.974395751953125] Our only negatives points were the breakfast was very poor.
[-0.96661376953125] Breakfast was disappointing but we usually just ate toast to get us going.
