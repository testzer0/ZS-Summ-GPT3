The hotel restaurant was fine, not great.

The location is an ideal jumping off point to some of the more interesting sites in Vancouver: Kitsilano, Jericho Beach, The Endowment Lands and Robson Street.
Oh, and Granville Island is one of the great treasures of Vancouver that residents regularly flock to and no tourist should miss.
The dining room in the hotel is the Dockside Restaurant which offers a fine menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The hotel in a different location would have been nice, but the location really made it special for us.
Within a 2 minute walk there are fantastic spots for breakfast, lunch and dinner and fun shopping and access to the sea wall.
They have a restaurant, and while we didn't eat there, it was packed and looked really good.
The restaurant deck had a great view.
It's location, 20 minutes to airport and 15 minutes downtown is ideal.
You're surrounded by water and a beautiful view of the city on charming Gran

***** Golden Review 1 *****
The location is amazing because you can walk to get food, drink, entertainment, and culture. It is very central and close to downtown and most city attractions. Basically the location is beautiful, quite, and perfect for convenience.

Built on an Island, the hotel is in a great location. It is very close to most of the city's attractions and within walking distance of local restaurants and bars.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
Even though we had requested the basic "non-view" category, our little balcony had a view of the water across to downtown, and a bonus was the fireworks over Science World (after all, it was Halloween).
The area is amazing with lots of shopping, great food and beautiful views!
Thanks again for a great Vacouver visit!
At the hotel’s restaurant where I ate often, the service was attentive and friendly; they even went out of their way tonight to make a strawberry compote for the cheesecake because I didn’t want the cherry compote!
If you’re looking for a walk-able and relaxing spot then this couldn’t be better!
We could not believe the view when we walked into our room.
Not what we expected to find in Vancouver.
The only other comment is about the huge trees that are planted directly in front of the million dollar view.
Fortunately the trees were not yet in bloom so we still had a great view, but that will be more limited in few weeks.
The staff, rooms and food are outstanding and the there's the location.
This location is amazing- I mean you don't have to drive anywhere to get food, drink, entertainment and culture.
We last stayed here 4 years ago and really loved the location.
We had to change our itinerary beforehand, so could only have a standard room for the first night and then a king suite for the following 2 nights.
There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.
We stayed here for the simple reason of location.
There was a large function going on when we got in 11:00 ish on a Sunday night.
Did check out the restaurant during regular business hours several times and the food, service and beer brewed on premisise was an all around thumbs up!
It is great to be on the "Island" and able to visit all the great shops and the Market.
The hotel is right on the water (harbor) with a direct view of the hi-rises of Vancouver.
There is plenty of pathway to take a romantic walk around the island (on the water) and to observe water traffic.
Location wise hard to beat, just a short ferry ride from town and an easy walk over bridge.
We live in Langley, so didn't come far.
Our son and new daughter-in-law decided on the Dockside restaurant for their reception so we thought we would also stay the night at the hotel to extend the fun and relax.
We LOVED this place!
The location is FANTASTIC for anyone who wants to be close to downtown but not right in the middle of the busy traffic and challenging parking.
The wonderful public market and numerous restaurants and shops are just a quick walk away, as are the ferries that take you to other parts of Vancouver.
You can make a longer walk to Vanier Park and an even longer walk/easy drive to Kitsilano.
Downtown is an easy drive.
We paid $12 a day for the extended stay parking pass and never once had trouble finding a spot next to the hotel.
What a spot !
The restaurant food was excellent.
The highlight was the restaurant, which had the best food on the island and quite possibly in all of Vancouver's westside.
The location was ideal and the staff were superb.
The location of this hotel is second to none!
We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel because it was close to the Stanley Theatre and a $12 cab fare to downtown.
The temperature control ( an old round dial type of thermostat) didnt work so we couldnt adjust the temperature, other then by opening a window.
It is located ~30mins cab ride from Vancouver airport on Granville Island.
The location is amazing, Granville Island is a tourist hotspot, filled with art galleries and a indoors farmers market which is a must see and great place for lunch.
The hotel is located right on the water.
Restaurant in the hotel, plus many on Granville Island to choose from.
A good launching pad if you are staying in Vancouver.
The hotel restaraunt was ok, not outstanding but pretty good.
The bar was really nice and I spent a nice couple hours there on a sunny afternoon enjoying a slow pint.
No fuss about parking.
I had requested a view of the water and the room was lovely.
The restaurant has a fabulous view of the harbour which we enjoyed both mornings for breakfast.
The service in the restaurant was a bit snobbish and I didn't get the condiments I requested the second morning, however this is minor in my opinion.
A clean, comfortable, convenient and scenic place to stay for visitors to Vancouver.
Hop on a nearby ferry to explore downtown, the West End, Yaletown or Chinatown.
The location, although not downtown, was still great.
It's actually a good thing that we weren't in the centre.
It was very easy to travel around Vancouver from here.
All the major sight-seeing bus tours stop just a couple of minutes walk away as does public transport.
The restaurant also has a terrific view and the people were very nice.
The location of the hotel also makes it easy to have a stroll around Granville Island, but you'll need a taxi to get to the clubs and shopping in the city proper.
So I declared that I was taking the dog and going away for the holiday.
My then-love was invited, of course, but he decided to stay home and fulfill his obligation to his family of origin.
We had shared a home for over 6 years at this point, so the loyalty to family surprised me a bit but I got over it at this lovely get-away.
I love having the restaurant (with their own brewery!)
Drove to Whistler and spent a week there.
The Dockside Restaurant has a beautiful view of the waterfront and the ambiance was warm and contemporary.
What a great plus to have a class-act restaurant located within the hotel.
Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market.
Driving to Yaletown, North Vancouver, Stanley Park and other surrounding attractions/destinations made it easy.
or Google Map and simply printed the directions.
The restaurant too was really great and prices were in line with good restaurants in Vancouver.
Although the hotel has parking for a daily fee, it is best not to bring your car as the island is definitely best seen on foot and driving on the island is difficult as pedestrians are everywhere.
It's close walking distance to everything we want to walk to: shops, restaurants, views and the seawall trail.
We have stayed as a couple and with our children.
It was like a peaceful oasis in a major metropolitan area.
We simply loved starting and finishing every day on Granville Island.
We would eat breakfast in the Market take one of the super cute little ferries over to Vancouver, explore the city and then take a cab back for a peaceful dinner in one of the many very nice restaurants on the island.
The restaurant was a little bit pricey for our budget.
The best of all is that it is located on Granville Island.
There is great restaurants close by, downtown is easily accessible, you have an amazing view of the city and the mountains, and you can have a quite night of sleep!
Granville Island Hotel is located in one of the best spots in an increasingly bustling city of Vancouver.
Its out of the way, but in the middle of everything.
Close to the market, the Arts Club Theatre, funky shops and downtown.
We opened our window to a view of the creek.
Parking was an extra charge, but cheaper than downtown, and unless you're staying in the burbs, parking is going to cost you.
Stayed for 4 nights in August 06 and was impressed from the 1st minute of my arrival.
Very pretty outlook over the harbour.
The location was perfect.
We asked for a room with a view of the water and were very happy with the beautiful view.
Everybody was very nice and I can't say enough about the great location.
In addition, when my family and I arrived early, they gave us a parking pass well before check-in time.
That view is killer, and with two decks with which to view it!
Go to the adjoining restaurant - Docksider - for at least one meal.
Awesome food, service and view!
We had a car, so we were able to drive to many places in Vancouver like Stanley Park, Canada Place, Chinatown, Robson Street, Yaletown, etc.
We had a two night stay in Vancouver to attend a family event.
Located in a wonderful location for walking and sightseeing, we loved being close to the Granville Island market, and enjoying the stunning maritime scenery of Vancouver.
Chips and salsa *The restaurant deck is very nice and modern and quite a gem....too bad about the service and the food.
* The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
We booked the hotel on Hotels.ca for two days.
We were charged $12 per day for parking and in-room water.
The website's info said $8 per day for parking and complimentary in- room water.
The size was adequate for us -- as we do not spend a lot time in a hotel, preferring to see the city instead.
As it was misty and a bit rainy that day they offered us the use of an umbrella which made our walk around the area much more pleasant.
We stayed there for a wedding last weekend and the location was handy.
Restaurant was great.
Hello Christine, My wife and I were in Vancouver when Summer struck(July28-Aug.2),we were there for a family wedding which was at the Fairmount Pacific Rim,however having previously stayed on Granville Island that was and will continue to be our first choice for accommodation in Vancouver.
We held our wedding reception at the Hotel's lounge and found that we were overall very disappointed.
The location is great, the waitstaff good and the food ok.
What can we say, with the great location, ambiance and first class staff , who met our every need.
The Dockside Restaurant, with the large aquarium and with the in-house Dockside Brewing Company (the beer is good), offered a really enjoyable tasty meal.
We often visit Vancouver to see family, and decided to stay someplace different.
As they say there "No worries", because you could duck in and out of the little shops and galleries without getting too wet, and when a real downpour came as we were dressed up and heading into the city, we were offered a huge umbrella by the staff, which we kept until check out.
Please do try the restaurant.
We heard from friends that it is really wonderful when you can sit outside.
So, I would recommend this hotel for its unique location and friendly staff.
The location is cool in that you're in the only hotel on the Island, everyone knows where to find it, and it's central in the city.
The place is a bit confusing to drive into at night if you're unfamiliar with the area, but my GPS showed the way.
The front desk clerk suggested paying $16 for parking permit "to be safe" in a 3 hour parking zone enforced between the hours of 9pm to 7am, even though I was outside those hours.
Had breakfast at the restaurant.
Service was fast, the food was very good and the dining room had nice water views.
Overall, I really liked the place and would return.
Not the easiest to get to, but once you arrive you are set for the rest of your visit.
Easy access to downtown, Science Centre, English Bay, etc.
via AquaBus, and that's only if you have time to do any of that after checking out all the great places on the Island.
Also an easy walk to 4th Ave. which is great up towards Arbutus, Kits beach, and you can step right out the hotel door onto the SeaWall for a run around False Creek.
The hotel is not far from the Aqua Bus, taxis, and the Granville Island Public Market making it easy to get around.
The hotel is well situated.
The location is just perfect.
My family consists of myself, my husband and our 8 year old son.In total we were in Vancouver for about 6 days and we never needed to take a bus or taxi during our whole trip other than the Aquabus to/from Granville Island.
But it was great actually being based on Granville Island.
Also with the theatres, great restaurants , the artists studios/shops, the microbreweries etc it's a brilliant area .
Do not hire a car and try to park it here.
Granville Island is very busy, & I frequently could not find hotel parking.
The daily parking charge is $12.
The V-shaped hotel has its restaurant and bar seating within the V, making for noisy evenings in your room.
The hotel restaurant merits only 3*, with slightly above average food (also expensive) .
The top reason we continue to choose this hotel is its location.
We value location and a clean and comfortable place to stay.
Granville Island is a great location to base a trip from if you are staying in Vancouver.
The parking lots can be have a bit of noise but is FAR better than other hotels I've stayed in while in Vancouver.
Nice way to see the park and bit more of Vancouver.
Being on the sea wall makes it safe and impossible to get lost.
We loved the brew pub as well.
We didn't want to rent a car, and this location was perfect.
The island itself is lovely to wander around, and each day we bought either breakfast or a picnic lunch at the market.
The island is also super for kids with the kids market and a free water park.
We live on the North Shore and decided to have a down town holiday.
Granville Island Hotel was brilliantly located in the middle of False Creek activity.
Took the little aquabus across to Yaletown and rode bikes along sea wall.
Took Aquabus back via Science World, live theatre on Granville island, great exploring all over the island - shops, food market, craftspeople and artists.
There was a great market on the island and walking paths.
The Marina was great to take a short ride around False Creek.
Granville Island itself is fascinating - I could spend a fortune in the market, and the Kids Market is good for clothes and shoes as well as toys.
The Dockside Restaurant in the hotel is superb, and we ended up eating there twice for dinner.
I didn't eat at the restaurant since I only stayed overnight & was meeting friends elsewhere, so can't comment on that.
Easy walking distance to Granville Island Market, shops & theatres.
An enjoyable place to stay.
The Dockside Restaurant was very good.
Later that night, we went back to the Dockside restaurant for dinner.
Normally, you can only park for 3 hours on the island, which isn't nearly enough time to wander around and see everything, but the hotel offers free parking.
The Dockside restaurant is also lovely.
The location is very good being very close to downtown and most city attractions.
Parking is a problem, and you will probably need to use the valet parking available at the hotel which costs $7.
I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
The hotel is located as close to the water as you can get without falling in.
The valet will help you find a spot for your car and the hotel gives you the required window permit that will allow your car to remain parked for more than the 3 hours the law allows.
Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes.
The restuarant in the hotel is quite nice and despite its "brewery" designation is much more of a full menu than you might expect.
Vancouver is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
The location is the biggest draw for us, Granville Island by day is full of energy, a great place to pick up something tasty at the Public Market, find a seat, listen to the buskers and people watch.
The restaurant is excellent, and good value if you take advantage of the $25 three-course special.
One of the drawbacks of staying on Granville Island is the parking - almost impossible at the weekend, even after paying the hotel $7 for a pass that allows you to park beyond the normal 3 hour limit.
Right in the heart of Granville Island to make it really easy to explore.
I love the location of this hotel!
Its perfect to be near the water and located in one of the greatest areas in Vancouver.
Meaning you had to go out on to the balcony and look to your right to see water.
I'm guessing that was fortunate since it was Easter and a conference was coming in a few days.
The restaurant on the ground floor is excellent.
We booked this hotel primarily because of its location, value, and it is close to downtown.
The biggest obivious attraction of this hotel is its location - smack dab in the middle of Granville Island, and therefore close to the restaurants, markets, shops, and galleries that are all nearby.
Like, I mean, within a couple of city blocks.
And on the water, the ships gliding by, the water taxis, the sailboats, the seagulls, and the smells of the sea, all at your doorstep.
Small personal feel to it.
Attached to the hotel is a great little patio restaurant by the water's edge (when weather permits) and a bar/restaurant inside with a mico-brewery.
But don't fret, you are in Vancouver, where a new restaurant is born every week.
Easy to park your car right in the lot in front of the hotel or the hotel staff will even volunteer to park it for you.
The location is excellent and they give you a parking permit to park on the island (normally there is a 3 hour maximum).
We never had a problem parking the car even though the island gets very busy on the weekends.
The hotel restaurant was fine, not great.
The second room we were in had a view of the water which made it more bearable.
and it was unclear as to whether we should evacuate.
The location is an ideal jumping off point to some of the more interesting sites in Vancouver: Kitsilano, Jericho Beach, The Endowment Lands and Robson Street.
Oh, and Granville Island is one of the great treasures of Vancouver that residents regularly flock to and no tourist should miss.
The dining room in the hotel is the Dockside Restaurant which offers a fine menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The hotel in a different location would have been nice, but the location really made it special for us.
Within a 2 minute walk there are fantastic spots for breakfast, lunch and dinner and fun shopping and access to the sea wall.
They have a restaurant, and while we didn't eat there, it was packed and looked really good.
The restaurant deck had a great view.
It's location, 20 minutes to airport and 15 minutes downtown is ideal.
You're surrounded by water and a beautiful view of the city on charming Granville Island.
It's an oasis in the heart of Vancouver.
This hotel is located close enough to downtown to walk to in 1/2 hour( using the aquabus to cross the channel) but also very close to local interesting sites on granville island and is a 15 min walk to Broadway St and 4th Ave where there are numerous placed to eat.
The location, for me, is ideal, the reception very friendly and efficient and the rooms great value for the price.
There is a little bar area with sink, microwave and mini fridge....nice touches.
Couldn't have asked for a better location, and although we stayed in August, parking never seemed to be an issue except that it was $12.00 plus tax .....ouch!
The hotel's bar and restaurant were both very nice, offered good food and beverages.
The hotel's bar and restaurant were both very nice, offered good food and beverages.
The only reason I did not give it 5 out of 5 stars is because of its location.
Granville Island was a little too touristy for me.
In a beautiful, quiet location, it has so much to offer.
Overlooking a marina and with fine views over Vancouver it really is ideally situated.
So apart from location, what else commended it to me?
Thirdly, the restaurant was excellent.
Being a only a few minutes walk to Granville Island Market and a variety of nice, small shops was a bonus.
A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
on location - it is not downtown but across the water.
it is a getaway in the middle of the city.
