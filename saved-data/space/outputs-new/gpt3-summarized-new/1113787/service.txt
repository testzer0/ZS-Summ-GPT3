Part 1 of 8: The service at the hotel is hit or miss, but the staff is friendly and willing to help. There have been issues in the past with service, but the new GM is working to improve things. The turn-down service was praised, as was the car parking service.
Part 2 of 8: The service at the Joule is great--everyone is also willing to help out and is very welcoming. For the most part the staff doesnt have all the attitude that the W staff does. Some of the younger front desk staff tend to be a little snooty. but for the most part, the staff is excellent. The manager of the attached restaurant is also really helpful and provides excellent service - even though the restaurant is independently managed. They upgraded us to a suite free of charge, brought in cupcakes, a special beer and were of ongoing assistance through out the stay, helping to make his birthday a great day and full of surprises. The staff is fantastic - Neil and Myron at the Front Desk always make me feel Welcome and Gus at the Valet provides a level of service rarely seen at any hotel. From the minute I pulled into the hotel, it was nothing but first class service and a professional knowledgable staff. I will be back again and recommend the switch to all my friends. Craig was very knowledgable and helpful with everything, from finding a suitable conference room for our meetings to finding the perfect meal in town! I will be staying at the Joule again thanks to Craig and his outstanding customer service and ample knowledge of Dallas

***** Sentences in Cluster ****
I stayed here for one night for a short business trip with meetings in Dallas downtown.
Turns out I was way wrong.
Internet cost the usual $12 to $14 a day.
We were barked at by the manager twice for bringing in outside food eve though we were buying their pricey drinks and paying for rooms there.
The service was amazing and the food was amazing.
Very nice and helpful staff.
The staff are all young and good looking with little knowledge of service expectations.
I was so amazed at the rust on the equipment.
The only service which was spot on was the car parking service and staff.
The turn down service was another amazing experience.
She then handed me a bag , yes a bag of ice.
Service was wonderful and the grilled cheese is to die for in room service.
Some of the few that stand out would be Danielle, Jessica, and Katie at the front desk.
Also Brendan and Craig were the best, they would bend over backwards to accommodate me.
I read the reviews before I went so I addressed some of the service issues beforehand.
Their new GM is aware of the service issues they have had and he is working to turn it around.
We were treated very well.
They apologized profusely and comped us all our drinks.
The staff seems very willing to hear feedback and make it better.
Service is hit or miss.
The staff was friendly from the time I made arrangements over the phone w/ the concierge (prior to our arrival) through the time we left the hotel.
We received prompt and courteous service at check-in, and arrived to find an extremely nice well appointed room.
The Joule staff suprised us with a complimentary bottle of champagne upon our return from the pool.
The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
I've stayed in numerous properties of this caliber over the last 25 years on business so I know what I'm talking about.
We walked to the front desk and were promptly greeted by name, wished a happy anniversary complete with a champagne toast and our room keys.
All of the staff appeared to really like their jobs.
It was more than your usual hotel staff friendliness, it was an attitude of liking what they did.
I stay in Dallas quite a bit for business and this is one of two hotels I frequent (W is the other).
The service at the Joule is great--everyone is also willing to help out and is very welcoming.
The staff for the most part are excellent and helpful.
For the most part the staff doesnt have all the attitude that the W staff does.
Some of the younger front desk staff tend to be a little snooty.
but for the most part, the staff is excellent.
The manager of the attached restaurantis also really helpful and provides excellent service - even though the restaurant is independently managed.
They upgraded us to a suite free of charge, brought in cupcakes, a special beer and were of ongoing assistance through out the stay, helping to make his birthday a great day and full of surprises.
The staff is fantastic - Neil and Myron at the Front Desk always make me feel Welcome and Gus at the Valet provides a level of service rarely seen at any hotel.

Craig was very knowledgable and helpful with everything, from finding a suitable conference room for our meetings to finding the perfect meal in town!
I will be staying at the Joule again thanks to Craig and his outstanding customer service and ample knowledge of Dallas and the metroplex.
The accomodations were wonderful, the canti-levered pool was gorgeous and the lobby ultra chiq...but the best attribute by far was the care and attention to detail given by Henry and the valet staff!
Always curteous and extremely helpful, they went above and beyond in getting us where we nneded to go and on time!!
Thank you for a fabulous weekend and hats off to Henry and the entire valet staff and their "bloody good" service!
We were very impressed with the service and attention to detail.
Staff is incredible.
Danielle and Gregory were always there for whatever we needed.
The actual service at the front desk seemed a bit patchy, depending on who was there.
The staff for the cars, porters and in the pool bar were all friendly and helpful.
The guys dropped us at some shops, and also organized the rides too and from the hotel (with an external provider you pay direct).
The customer service was excellent and Ms. Chasity Gray was outstanding, as she went the extra mile to make sure our stay was a memorable one!!!
I have read some of the reviews that spoke of bad service.
I cant say enough about the service.
They seemed eager to work and acted like they truly enjoyed their job.
Bryce, Bryson & Nikki, they should recieve and outstanding service award.
I have not experienced that before, he was very patient, kind and accomodating.
He also went on an errand for me as I was running out of time to get ready for a wedding.
Bryson also has great customer service and I enjoyed visiting with Bryson on the front sidewalk several times.
I suggest you take a look at the managment position as the pool ran out of Chardoney on Saturday night before 10pm and no one offered to go get us some more.
I find that very unproffessional as a manager not to be stocked or offer to go get what the customer is requesting.
Bryce, Bryson and Nikki were willing to do whatever it took to take care of us, they just had their hands tied and could only do so much.
I think the Joule has a ways to go when it comes to the managers making the decisions.
I think you have some great staff out front you might want to have Bryce and Bryson or Nikki teach your managers what it means to have great customer service!
our contact at the hotel, Jessica Craycraft, went above and beyond to provide us with quality service and was always available whenever we needed something.
The staff was friendly yet very professional.
the overall service provided was great value for money.
The staff was very informative on things going on downtown and in the general vicinity of the hotel.
I had a group of 18 for me and my coworkers here for a series of business meetings in Dallas.
Special sincere thanks to Myron, Andrew, Maverick, Clint, Nikki, Mark, and the entire Joule staff for helping make our weekend at the Joule literally perfect.
Each members flawless execution in hospitality was truly extraordinary and we look forward to coming back soon.
The salmon here is especially good â€¢ Service â€“ Very good and the staff are very friendly.
However, Shawn at the bar, Scott the restaurant's executive chef, and Todd at the hotel bar have MORE than made up for the rough start.
Their understanding of customer service, above and beyond attention to detail and courtesy have made this a repeat destination on the list.
As a famous restaurant critic once said, "I'll forgive a bad meal but not bad service".
They recommended local restaurants and entertainment locations.
The staff was very courteous and helpful.
Also, the hotel offers complimentary shoe shining service.
The attention we received the entire time we were at the hotel was excpetional and I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants personal attention.
Thanks to all the staff that helped us relax and enjoy ourselves!
We have NEVER had a bad experience with that company until now.
Furthermore, room service was closed at 10 pm, front desk was unhelpful (in ordering a pizza nonetheless) and Charlie Palmer was a waste of time and energy (great staff, HORRIBLE management.)
The staff is great and the hotel has a great Charlie Trotter restaurant.
We stayed here for an Anniversary weekend getaway in Dallas and we were very impressed with the rooms and the service!
We were treated to excellent service, including some perks at Charlie Palmer's and PM Lounge.
Front desk even followed up to see how everything was going with our stay.
They also have an Escalade car service to take you to dinner reservations or anywhere within (I think) 5 miles of the hotel.
Even with it being first come, first serve, the service only had about a 10 minute wait on a Saturday night.
The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.
From the moment we arrived at the hotel, valet and front desk staff greeted us attentively.
The staff are courteous and professional, without overdoing it.
The have really nice turn down service, too.
I often stay at great hotels, but the staff at the Joule Hotel made our stay awesome beyond belief!!!
Nicole, Nikki,maverick, Todd, and Andrew made our stay memorable!
I'm so grateful for they're amazing service!!!
After my first drink we had to flag down a girl to ask for another as the pool area was not busy maybe 6 other people so ni reason for service to be that bad.
Then I went up to bar to close tab again just standing there it took ten mins, then the manager of the pool and club pm was there and was very friendly offered us free drinks and help but I rejected I no longer wanted to be around that.
Then Saturday evening after having night of fun on town came back to order room service it took 45 mins.
to get ONE sandwhich I had to call and ck on it and there are slow and the service is so bad and the managers know which makes it WORSE...
The staff was magnificent, very helpfull and informative.
He went above and beyond, and I appreciate everything he did.
The staff made us feel welcome and relaxed from the minute we pulled up to the valet stand.
The staff is professional and accommodating of all needs.
All in all, the one thing that stood out the most throughout my stay was by far the service.
From the bell staff, to the bar staff, everyone was friendly, welcoming and eager to help all the time.
When we checked out Danielle made it effortless and enticed us to come back again which we will and Travis that got our bags was warm and considerate to the delay we had in checking out.
It was really disappointing to have not just one error but two errors on my bill.
The staff was friendly and informative.
Good location and very helpful staff.
To his credit he was very helpful and filled out a claim report and gave us info about who to contact.
Hopefully they will step up and take care of this.
We especially found the room service to be timely and tasty (yes, we even had breakfast by the pool one day!).
The front desk staff was very nice and smiled.
The doorman who brought up our bags also offered to bring us ice.
They even offer a turndown service which includes Rose Petals on the bed.
The food and service is amazing!
.especially if you like a trendy feel, mixed with fabulous customer service.
Totally agree with W without the attitude.
I was here on business with a client and we both totally love this place.
I selected this location to celebrate my retirement following 25 years service with the United States Courts.
The staff was excellent and even helped us get on the VIP list at a club.
Anything we asked for was done.
Promptly there.
Need a ride to the State Fair?
Service was always with a smile and was always excellent.
The staff is excellent and did everything possible to ensure we had a wonderful stay.
We truly appreciate everything the staff did to ensure our visit was special.
It's not often I can say that I was treated like a celebrity.
Upon leaving the hotel I received a call that I left a very expensive watch in the room safe and it was returned with full communication.
These folks go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable and hassle free.
The service was absolutely first rate.
The bellman had my luggage out of the trunk before I stepped out of the car and led me inside.
I stayed with you all in May of this year and I must say you have some of the best staff ever...
After that was all said and done Rudy assisted me with my bags and was very thoughtful of coversation the entire way up!!!
The Bellman/Valet Team are incredible and make you feel right at home each time!
Bryson (I think was his name) was so nice and made me feel right at home.
We enjoyed the Charlie Palmer for dinner and drinks nightly, and were treated like VIP's everywhere we went.
The staff was very friendly and helpful.
Stayed there for one night so I did not get to use any of the hotel services nor dine there.
However, the staff were all very nice and helpful.
They also have complimentary car service via a Cadillac Escalade which takes you and picks you up anywhere within 5 miles of the hotel.
Truly a wonderful, and from my experience unique service.
My friend finally asked why we were waiting while everyone else was allowed in and the man very rudely announced that those folks were hotel guests.
The birthday girl informed the man that she too was a hotel guest but he only said he would look into it.
I was appalled that we were treated that way.
It was insulting that the doorman/management were so disrespectful and unwilling to take care of their guest.
Thank you so much JENNIFER AND STAFF!
A great customer experience is achieved by everyone doing everything right.
It can take just one person to undo it too.
I would with out reservation give it 5 stars, everyone ....everyone we came into contact was friendly, professional and made our stay very enjoyable.
I ended a five week business trip at this hotel and it was by far the best experience that I had.
The staff is truly extraordinary and made me feel at home.
My patience was def tested at this hotel at the incompetence incurred.
Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
They havent offered any sort of compensation or lousy apology.
Still waiting for this latest issue to be resolved after being trf to 3 ppl at the hotel.
Absolutely ridiculous service for any hotel let alone one u pay $300+ a night for.
I've never written a review but want to save ppl this drama, thanks the joule for totally ruining our first wedding anniversary!!
hotel service was wonderful.
The Incredible Customer Service starts when you arrive at the door.
The Staff went above and beyond.
Cons: Service is terrible!!
It seemed as if they had the "summer staff" on duty.
He did not offer to help in any way.
That evening, I placed my room service order on my door well before the requested time of midnight.
After waiting 45 minutes, I finally opened my door and realized they didn't even pick up the card.
After calling down to the desk, they did not even give a simple apology.
Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an "upscale" hotel.
The service I recieved at the restaurant was also wonderful.
They were prompt, polite, and very accomodating.
The service there was exceptional, the area was very clean and very well maintained.
The room service was wonderful - the food was great, and the service was, again, exceptional.
Not only is this a great hotel, but I was traveling on business and experienced an illness during my trip.
Not only did the hotel help me find a local doctor, but the manager on duty checked on me and sent chicken soup to the room to help me feel better.
We arrived there and were greeted out front by a wonderful staff that helped to unload and park the car.
She was amazing, she ensured that we were at ease with the accommodations...she even sent up complimentary milk and cookies for our four year old daughter.
She was so friendly and attentive!
When we checked out the next day, she even came out with us as we waited and we talked some more!
The staff in charge of the party was also great.
They were there whether you needed a drink, desserts, or to clean up an area.
The staff here is great.
I left a personal item behind when i checked out, and they called me that night and shipped it the next day.
If your review is questioned you get no say in the process.
My inital review was deemed a duplicate after being flagged?
Not sure how that worked out, regardless I'll resubmit my review till I pass with flying colors and no red marks!
Perhaps this is where my review was deemed a duplicate?
She was very shot with me when I talked to her, it was as if my research wasn't quite up to her standards of places to go.
Her tone was condescending which I was off set by, not something I was expecting or enjoyed all that much.
Second time the charm on my review?
I was treated wonderfully.
Chasity Gray helped arrange my stay at this very impressive hotel.
She was very pleasant to work with and made sure my guest were comfortable throughout there stay.
