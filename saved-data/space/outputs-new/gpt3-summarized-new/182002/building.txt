Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
Which made it easy to stumble through the lobby drunk and singing at 1:00 a.m.
While taking an elevator to our room, we noted the bottom of the elevator was being held together with a piece of plywood.
We had many people coming for this conference that had scratched their cars or some that cracked their exhaust pipe.
The property was much better then I expected.
Be prepared to wait at least five minutes, and the doors sensors do not work, which was very annoying.
Relatively safe neighborhood in the "gay" area, but there were a few crazies walking the streets and some just high on drugs.
Several blocks walking to Eaton Center, the shopping mall nearby.

It wasn't obvious and I only noticed it because I was accessing a wall plug behind the bedside table.
They moved very slow but at least they are undergoing renovation.
Nice lobby.
Our car was broken into.
They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting.
There were lots of restaurants around, and found the area and city in general to be very family friendly.
There aren't many facilities and the internet in my room cut out once in a while.
We also experienced the subway and found it was very easy to get around.
