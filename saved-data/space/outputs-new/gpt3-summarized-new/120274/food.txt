Part 1 of 2: The food at the hotel is average, but there are many places to eat around the hotel. The Chinese buffet next door is a good option.
Part 2 of 2: The food at the hotel was not great. There was only coffee, juice, toast and cereal available for breakfast, and often the bread would be finished before the breakfast session ended. The coffee was bad, and the water tasted like sulfur or burnt hair.
