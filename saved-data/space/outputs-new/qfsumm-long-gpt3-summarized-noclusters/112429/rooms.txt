The best included the cleanliness, the attention to detail with lighting and electrical outlets, the comfortable furniture, the robes, the great shower, the refrigerator, the windows can open, the wide and well lit hallways (although too warm) and of course an excellent king bed.
I will be very happy to stay at this hotel each time I return to Seattle, especially if I can get the great rate I paid by calling the hotel directly to book in advance.
I stayed for 5 nights and by the 5th night I was dreadfully ill.
I cannot say for sure that it was due to the room but it is highly suspect.
Which was OK by the way for dinner.
Stayed at the Paramount for two nights.
The room was on the small side but was stylish, comfortable, and clean.
The hotel is conveniently located, has a helpful and friendly staff, and is within walking distance to PPM, Capitol Hill, Belltown, and the Space Needle.
The rooms for the price were not very good.
The bathroom is the size of a closet and the hot water took forever to warm up.
The halls had a very odd smell, like a dental office.
Which they don't tell you when you reserve the room and I wasn't expecting.
There are plenty of other hotels and we will be trying a different one for the convention next year.
The room was OK, typical hotel room with queen bed, desk, TV, clock radio, coffee maker.
Definitely needed the curtains open by day.
I did not use room service.
Not fancy, but offered exactly what I needed.
Rooms very nice and restaurant downstairs had great breakfast.
Location is great, rooms are pretty nice for the price and the happy hour deals at Dragonfish are quite nice.
So all in all, I think the Paramount is a solid choice for your time in Seattle.
The best thing about the Paramount Hotel is it's location and price compared to other downtown hotels.
It's perfect if you have tickets to the nearby Paramount Theater and want to spend the night in Seattle.
The corner rooms are the nicest and have nice city views.
The convention hotel was full, so I took a chance on the Paramount, at half the price.
Great room, helpful staff, just one block from the convention center.
A functional hotel, comfortable, worth its price.
I like breakfast buffets, there isnâ€™t one in this hotel.
The breakfast (paid separately) in the restaurant Dragonfish CafÃ© at the hotel is limit priceworthy.
Nonetheless I would come back.
We stayed here for a couple of nights this past summer.
This hotel is 4 stars all the way, and in a fantastic location downtown.
Rooms are very clean, and modern and the service was excellent.
I debated whether to stay here or the Hyatt which was right in front of it.
I got this room through Quikbook for 129.00 the night, the Hyatt was at 170.00.
The rooms from the website looked less luxurious than the Hyatt but I have to say photos were deceiving.
Very comfortable room, beds were queens not fulls.
I slept better on these beds than the famous heavenly beds of the Westins where we had just stayed at when we came down from Vancouver.
Highly recommend this hotel rooms, they were nice and clean and very comfortable.
First off we reserved 2 rooms with 2 queens.
We got 2 rooms with kings on different floors.
They did provide us with roll-away beds but then there was no room to move around in the room.
There is no pool..the breakfast is in the restaurant and it starts at like $8, you can't put out a little fruit for your guests, the paper is 75 cents a day.
My room was neatly decorated and very up-to-date.
It made me feel like I was at home, not just in a hotel room.
I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to my next visit so I can come back to my home away from home in Seattle.
Rooms are average size.
Beds were comfortable.
Stayed at The Paramount in late September 2011 for one night before a cruise.
The desk clerk was very friendly and efficient and was willing to help in answering any questions.
Had a room on the 8th floor facing The Grand Hyatt.
The room was clean and the beds were fine.
You can't expect much better from a 3 star hotel.
It was a south facing room and in the sun, tended to get a little hot.
May be just a problem with that room and wasn't a big issue only being there for the one night.
Hotels in Seattle tend to be very expensive, especially downtown.
Our room was beautiful-we still talk about the beds-and we couldn't get enough of the sushi restaurant downstairs!
The Paramount was a lovely hotel.
This is a good choice for Downtown Seattle.
Other rooms might not have this problem.
Overall a good hotel very convenient for shopping.
We found the Paramount hotel an exceptional value for our purpose.
The room was meticulously cleaned including plenty of soft linins and offers one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on.
Our package also included two complimentary breakfasts which were satisfying.
This was our 4th or 5th stay at this hotel.
Rooms are currently being refurnished with new furniture.
Some other restaurants in the area within two blocks (Vons, Cheesecake factory).
My husband and I stayed, for the first time, in a corner king room.
We were impressed with the lobby and had high hopes for the room.
While it wasn't a bad room, and we would consider the hotel again if we were going to a concert, it certainly wasn't anything memorable.
The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.
Overall, it was just an o.k.
The rooms were very well decorated, with a flat screen tv, marble bathroom, great view, etc.
The front desk was quick and helpful.
3 nites of good beds, clean room/bathroom, good staff, went for gift show in nearby convention ctr.
we've stayed all over seattle, and this newer hotel is a great buy, request corner room for bigger one, and join the hotels' guest program, coast hotels to get free upgrades
We were paying about $10 more per night than other relatives staying in a Best Western near Seattle Center, and this was a better area in which to stay and a nicer hotel.
This boutique hotel has some style as opposed to the big chains, obvious even to my teenage daughter commenting on the details.
The room was very dark at night and the beds were comfy, so we got a great night's sleep.
The Concierge pointed us to an outdoor creperie for breakfast (yum!)
The hotel has gone through some renovations which make it look nice, Dragonfish changed their menu a bit but their food is still good.
A nice and elegant no frills hotel with great personal service, I have and always will recommend this hotel.
I was not particularly disappointed, nor was I blown away.
My room was nice enough, but faced the Hyatt and so was a little dark with little natural light.
All in all I would probably stay somewhere else next time, but wouldn't discourage anyone from selecting this place either.
The room was huge.
The beds were really comfortable.
After staying in Seattle at least six times and walking at least ten minutes from my hotel (even those attached to the convention center), this hotel was a blessing in disguise.
I found it be be very above average and charming.
Only 200 or so rooms, so never crowded.
The rooms were larger than most, woth the exception of a small closet.
The bed was comfy and had plenty of pillows.
Von's is one block away and the Cheesecake Factory is two blocks, as is The Oceanaire.
The hotel itself was very nice.
Rooms were very clean and comfortable.
A room on a higher floor would have been quieter.
We arrived and though there were few patrons, it took a while to be seated.

Given the chance I would come back to this hotel repeatedly.
The rooms were pretty large with average furnishings.
The furnishings were pretty old.
Nothing fancy about this hotel, but the location and the price were its main attraction.
What a great hotel.
The rooms are clean and modern and the beds are extremely comfortable.
The curtains are almost black out, which is great for sleeping in.
I didn't try the Dragonfish, but did order room service which was well priced (for room service anyhow) and was up in 10 minutes.
Great hotel, great service.
The hotel is just great!
The staff is friendly and super helpful (ie: tourist questions, room questions etc), the rooms are neat and clean and comfortable, the location is perfect and close to everything you need downtown including transit to anything outside of downtown (monorail, bus stops, lightrail).
The room was clean.
- Free coffee in the morning and apples in the afternoon - Beds are pretty comfy The cons: - The gym was a joke.
So now we are out a GPS and will NEVER stay at the Paramount again.
We have stayed here a couple of times and have enjoyed it.

The room was very clean.
There is an empty fridge for your use in the room, that was great.
The rooms were completely renovated and tastefully done.
The biggest issue is that upon going to bed the first night, I noticed an overpowering smell of urine in my bed.
Luckily, I retired the second bed in my room.
For a hotel in downtown Seattle, that was a very good offer.
Our room was very clean and the service was very friendly.
I would definitely choose this hotel again, especially if they are offering the parking promotion again.
Room was clean, bed was comfortable.
Amazing motel, amazing staff.
Loved the pillowtop beds, beautiful rooms, very quiet.
Squeaky clean room and nice size.
It was a wonderful hotel, but not intimidating or snobbish.
Generally, when we stay at a downtown Seattle hotel, we are happy to be getting back to our own homes and beds, but with Paramount, we were sorry we didn't have a few more days.
Rooms aren't big, just enough room for two people, bathroom had smallish tub but everything was clean and worked.
Beds comfortable but the windows seemed to have drafty gaps and the air conditioning unit on it let in outside air and sound as if it was an open window.
I stayed at this hotel while I was attending an expo at the convention center in January.
Hotel was very clean, very quiet, great for a business trip.

Large room, with amazing king size bed, stunning bathroom, and a view.
We were sad that we didnt get to stay longer at this hotel.
I knew the hotel as a family member had stayed there before, but wasn't familiar with it's details.
We were very pleased when we got to our room- quite spacious with a king bed that honestly gave us such a great sleep that we meant to ask the front desk about the mattress brand and bedding.
The Dragonfish Cafe in the hotel is simply awesome.
When we returned to the hotel and the Cafe, it was obvious that it was a popular spot for locals and hotel guests alike.
We retired to our room happy campers and, as mentioned, had a surprisingly excellent sleep.
The Paramount has clearly invested in the details.
The bed was very comfortable and the lobby staff friendly and helpful.
Upon checkout, we had to ask, for the third time, to have the breakfast charges removed.
One tip: if you want english breakfast or earl grey tea, don't order it from room service.
I had a corner room on the 9th floor and loved it!
I booked the room through Hotwire for $112+tax.
I was here to attend a Mariners game and meet up with a friend, and the room was comfortable for pre- and post-game socializing.
I was impressed with the room...while not being large, it had more than adequate space and amenities.
King sized bed (very comfortable), lounge chair and ottoman, large desk (with lots of electrical outlets!
), flat screen TV, and mini fridge.
The bathroom was separated into the sink/vanity and toilet/shower spaces which is nice.
We booked the Paramount with a little apprehension, since downtown hotels are often either industrial/impersonal or old school fusty.
The Paramount was neither, rather a tastefully designed, conveniently located (close to all central attractions and within the Ride Free Area for public transportation) facility.
Our room had a new and contemporary feel.
The bathroom was indeed on the small side but it presented no problems.
We encountered no advance charges for room service or damage; hopefully that policy is gone.
The hotel was recently renovated and is really nice.
The rooms were clean and I forgot an item and was able to get it back from the front desk staff.

Friendly welcoming staff, clean, one of the best hotels I've stayed at in a long time!
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by the Paramount Hotel.
My guest room was great -- well-designed, nice furniture, good work space, etc.
Best of all, the bed was incredibly comfortable!
It was really one of the most comfortable beds I've encountered in my travels.
Rocked up to The Paramount Hotel not expecting much after a not so nice hotel experience in New York but boy was I wrong.
Everything from the staff to the amenities everything.
The room was cosy, the free WiFi was a godsend, the staff was courteous and helpful.
I would very much recommend The Paramount Hotel to any traveler passing through Seattle!
I loved everything about this hotel.
We stayed here for 3 nights in early September, and were glad we chose this hotel.
I'm normally a firm matress kind of guy, but I swear lying on that bed was like lying on a cloud.
I'm normally not a fan of having the bathroom sink outside of the bathroom, and not beyond a closed door, but the way they configured the room, you got the best of both worlds.
Next time we're in Seattle, we'll definitely be staying at this hotel again.
Laid back, nonintrusive hotel suitable for business or vacation stays, centrally located on Pine--3 blocks from Westlake, a block from the bus terminal ($2.75 airport transfers), and a block from Von's Martini and Manhattan Shrine, never to be missed.
The rooms are pleasant and clean, with the baffling omission of a coffee maker or kettle--really a weird thing to forget.
At the last minute, we booked a conference room for a couple days.
The room is well-appointed with contemporary furnishings and a comfortable bed.
There's a big TV, a sleek marble bathroom, a small closet, and a large desk in the room.
I stayed at the Warwick on my previous trip, and I've found the Paramount so much more to my liking.
And I've already recommended it to my fellow coworkers for their future trips to our corporate HQ.
The pillows are all really firm.
It would be nice to have an in-room microwave.
Your only option for room service (aside from breakfast) is overpriced -- tasty, but overpriced -- Asian cuisine from Dragonfish.
Room was pretty big and spacious and the bed was comfortable.
Everything was clean and furnishings were modern.
I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
Our first day and night at the hotel were great.
Room is decent and clean.
I was put in a room that just didn't have the feeling be being fresh and clean.
i was happily surprised at the paramount hotel.
the lobby is sort of lackluster but the rooms were tasfully updated and very clean.
the beds were comfy and nice bathroom ammentities.
only thing i did notice was in the hallways, as soon as you exited the elevator there was an odd smell but once you got inside your room it was gone.
Since then, I've stayed a couple of more times, including most recently in November 2011.
The hotel continues to impress and deliver an experience that is in-line with other major downtown Seattle chain hotels that charge a room rate that can be up to double what I pay at the Paramount.
The rooms are superb -- spacious, well-appointed, with awesome beds.
On this last stay, I was assigned a corner room which had great views but, because of having two windows and being on the corner of a busy street, was also a bit noisier (sirens, etc.)
that previous rooms.
A friend and I shared a room for one night in late Dec. 07.
The room was plain and average-szed, but clean and comfortable.
We've always enjoyed our stay at the Paramount Hotel in Portland, OR.
The hallway to our room smelled of cleaning or toiletry products (we couldn't tell which).
There appeared to be some water damage in our bathroom.
However, our room was clean and quiet.
What a great value for a great hotel.
The rooms are modern and clean.
The beds are comfortable and they have nice thick duvet blankets.
It's a smaller hotel, which works because you don't get lost in the shuffle of all the unnecessary things that some hotels have.
3 of us stayed in a room with 2 queen beds very comfortably.
The room was large with a desk area, comfortable chairs and a very comfortable bed.
The bathroom was roomy and supplied with great amenities.
It is perfect for a couples get-away or a business trip.
The bed and luxurious bedding were extremely comforting during the first 48 hours after the accident when I was aching so badly and just needed to sleep.
My family had a girl's weekend in Seattle and chose The Paramount Hotel due to it's proximity to all the attractions.
Rooms were comfortable as far as size and also very quiet.
The only complaint I have about the hotel are the beds.
They were were soft (as were the pillows) and didn't offer much support.
I didn't have any aches or pains from the beds, but I have definitely experienced better in other hotels.
Overall, I would suggest this to anyone going to Seattle needing to be near all the action!
I stayed at the Paramount while I was at a major political science convention down the street at the Washington State Convention Center.
The hotel is wonderfully situated for that--two blocks from the convention center entrance and across the street from another hotel where some of the conv.
The room was not huge but it was immaculately clean and very stylish.
I don't know when I'll be in Seattle again--it's a long way from Maine!--but when I do I would be happy to stay here again.
Stayed at the Paramount Hotel in Seattle on the front and back end of an Alaskan cruise.
Hotel is extremely clean and quiet, and the staff is very helpful.
Then coming back to the room tonight after being away from 8:30am to 8:30pm, the room had not been cleaned.
Clean rooms, pleasant staff with good restaurant recommendations, and fast, free internet.
This is not a huge corporate hotel.
The rooms are stylish and the bathrooms give you privacy if you are staying with someone else ( no peekaboo showers or open tops like some of the boutique hotels are pushing.)
The rooms are stylish and the bathrooms give you privacy if you are staying with someone else ( no peekaboo showers or open tops like some of the boutique hotels are pushing.)
The windows open also if you want fresh air (big plus for me!)
I looked out at the gray monolith walls of the Grand Hyatt.
If you don't need all of the bells and whistles but still like a little style to your room, I would recommend this place.
It did the job.
Rooms are roomy, especially by many downtown standards, and come nicely appointed with newly updated furniture and linens.
Lots of plugins (including two pop up plugs in on each of the nightstands) mean this is gadget friendly.
Just came back and loved this hotel.
Newly renovated rooms with high-end fixtures.
The rooms were quite stunning.
I believe we had a basic room with 2 queen beds and it was really lovely.
Nice little bar fridge, very comfy beds with white duvets (I hate hotel bedspreads!).
The hotel since I last stayed had gone through a nice renovation.
I was so impressed with the Paramount.
I have stayed in many of the downtown hotels in Seattle and I have to say that the Paramount is one of the nicest hotels downtown.
The hotel is very well kept and modern.
The room had a great feel to it and was very good size.
The bathroom was amazing.
The best part was the bed.
Probably one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept on.
The rooms are clean and neat, and the staff is friendly.
We stayed here for a couple of nights and I would definitely recommend this hotel.
There was also free wifi in the room and the cable package included HBO, which we love.
A lovely hotel with an updated room that was spotless.
Nice bed and mattress and it had a refridgerator.
The hotel is particularly convenient for those attending events at the Convention Center.
The room was comfortable and updated.
