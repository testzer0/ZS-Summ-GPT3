There are 3 and 4 star hotels just down the street from this one, and half the price.
It think it may also be the most expensive of all of the Toronto Marriott hotels.
Concierge lounge nibbles in the evening were a little disappointing, but the staff were friendly (I think this area used to be the old steak house).
If the price was right, I would go back.
The prices are way to high for what you get... a room.
which services starbucks coffee (for us Tim Horton's drinkers...not so great!!).
We didn't eat at the steak bar though.
The food was excellent.
Found the cheapest price directly on their website.
Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.
At over $250 a night, that's not too good.
Had a Bloody Ceasar at the Hotel Bar...ouch..10$ for a small glass.
Didn't eat there.
Don't eat at the hotel.
Food was good and service from all of the staff was extremely professional.
The meal itself was extremely good, it is well worth your money to have a meal there, you won't be disappointed.
I bought croissants, a pastry and some fruit.
The rooms are large and the food in the dining room is decent enough.
By the time we got back to the mainland and back to the mall adjacent to the hotel- the shoppers was closed.
asking if she had some band aids or knew of a shoppers super close by.
Again i treid to explain that i didn't really want to walk- especially in my situation and if the shoppers was not open for certain.
You may have a difficult fit.
We had breakfast and lunch at the Parkside restaurant in the hotel, the food was of a very high standard, and children less than three eat free ( it costs $7.95 for children over three for the breakfast buffet).
I can't comment on the food or drinks offered at the hotel as we did not order anything at the restaurant or room service - it was pretty expensive.
I got a discounted rate because I am a Marriott rewards member which made it worth it.
They even have a juicer with prepared vegetables that you can juice, cold deli meats and cheeses, omelet station, typical hot foods section, compotes,oatmeals, breads, etc.
...for more than $300 a night.
On each occasion I paid about $175 Canadian/night for the room (wouldn't pay a lot more for it).If shopping is not a top priority, there are probably more convenient locations for tourists to stay, but if you want to do some serious shopping, this is the place to stay.
During the conference, the food/service department did a fantastic job with meals.
We never went hungry and the quality of the food was excellent.
I felt that the hotel wisely focused on things we needed, like a coffee/tea maker, black out curtains, and a daily newspaper, while eliminating the nonessentials like mini-bar and robes.
The meal was pricey, but well worth it.
We are NOT demanding restaurant a patrons, but both the food and the service was poor.
When my husband's Cesar salad was served with chicken instead of salmon, he had to hunt down the waiter to point out the problem, and the waiter barely seemed to care.
Food presentation was fancy, but the food didn't taste very good.
I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.
And for this we paid fancy hotel restaurant prices - ugh!
Unlike many other hotel breakfasts, this one actually has good food!
I wasn't in any particular hurry, but just am not used to waiting for hot water these days.
***** Model produced summary *****
Overall, reviewers seemed to enjoy their stay at the hotel, despite some hiccups with the phone lines in some of the rooms. The staff was responsive and apologetic, and the rooms were up to Marriott's usual standards. The location was also praised, as it was adjacent to a mall and across the street from the city hall.

I hesitate to start with a description of a not-so-good experience, but the staff response to the not-so-good experience was handled so well that in the end, I left the hotel quite impressed.
I moved, and everything was then OK.
The bed was comfortable and I got a good night's sleep.

Overall I was pleased with the stay and the location worked well for my planned activities.
I went to Toronto with my son to celebrate his academic achievements in school.
It had an underground bridge linking it to the Eaton Centre Mall and the a subway station.
The only downsides are is that for $250 a night, you dont really get your moneys worth.
The pool area is quite small, and elevators, lobby is packed by noon, and there seem to be a lot of kids running around everytime im there, and the giftshop and cafe were very overpriced.
Although we didn't use the gym or pool located on the 18th floor we went up to visit.
The hotel was very busy during my stay with several conferences and events, but the staff maintained a good attitude.
And I agree with previous posters, they need new cable service for the TV.
I wish you could give Â½ star ratings on Tripadvisor as I felt this was 3 Â½ stars out of 5.
If that doesn't appeal to you, I suggest you save your money and stay elsewhere or spend it and stay somewhere much nicer.
There is a walk through to Eaton's.
That was great.
Hot Tub was good.
($something like $20 a day or something, so 3 days is pretty pricey).
Circuitous route to get to Eaton Centre inside- easier to go outside, although this was iffy at night, when lots of people gathering in dark corners between hotel and Eaton Centre.
Stayed here for 7 nights.
However, we were very dissapointed when we checked in to find that our sheets had stains on them and looked worn.
The sheets looked as though they had not been changed when we checked in.
We called reception at 3am to get them changed, they were apologetic and changed them immediately but even the 'new' sheets still had holes and looked worn!
Not good value.
I will stay here again and highly recommend this hotel.
We had a great time.
This was incredibly annoying and extremely loud in our room.
I understand that for safety reasons the alarm was necessary, but did not understand why the annoucements continued every 5 minutes advising that they were looking into the matter and would provide further information later.
Needless to say, it was difficult to sleep after this.
Other than that one tiny mishap, our stay was WONDERFUL and I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers, and would stay at the Marriott again myself.
The reason that I couldn't give a perfect score - in typical Marriott fashion everything is nickel-and-dime.
Marriott also has uncompetitive internet access rates - because internet and phone are bundled together as a package.
Other than that, a very good stay.
Near the mall entrance you will find a Starbucks and the entrance to the subway where you can catch a quick ride to Union Station (CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Hockey Hall of Fame, etc.)

Would stay there again.

No other perks.

Stayed here with our two kids ages 6 and 4 during Canadian Thanksgiving.
Had a great stay and would come back again!
Will stay here again.
We checked out early (9am) on a Sunday morning.
But for the deal that we received $149CN for a Saturday stay, we can't really complain.
!
The Eaton Centre is marvellous..
Can't wait for my next visit!
Check in was quick, easy, and again the staff were very helpful.
We told them we were checking in.
The receptionist informed us that this Marriott was not a participating member of the "promotion", even though we showed the printout of what was sent to us.
As it turned out, his costs were much higher than what we paid.
There are much better options.
We purchased a Saturday day pass on the Toronto Transit system and used it extensively to get around to tour Toronto.
While there is a garbage strike going on, the city was still relatively clean and everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful.

I was surprised, after reading the reviews on this site, and visiting the hotel the disparity that exists between the two.
The worst part of the stay however was finding two LARGE insects or animals, something in the room!
One was dead and under the chair in the room, and the other my husband saw scurrying across the floor.
When we complained to the front desk, they didn't say sorry, they simply said they'd send someone up.
I was so frustrated.
The Eaton Centre is just steps away.
I sat outside on a beautiful warm evening.
Other than that it was great and I would love to stay there again.
Checking out next morning was simple.
We definitely could hear some...*ahem* rhythmic knocking on the walls from next door.
Great stay!
I don't agree with the majority of the rave reviews for this hotel.
However, the next day after walking around in this room for an hour in clean white socks...I noticed that the bottom of these socks were filthy with dirt, grime.
Paid $200 a night the first time, and then $260 the second.
I did get the internet and breakfast as part of the deal the 2nd time around, but would rather have paid the $200 without the extras, but didn't have a choice.
It was like there was no sound-proofing whatsoever.
We could hear people walking and talking in the hallway and talking in the next room.
Friday AM I had surgery.
We went to the Toronto Islands on sunday and when I was there- my stiches started to leak.
I explained that I had just had surgery and needed assistance.
Highly recommend.
Best to call property directly for best rates.
Marriott website or other sites may not have best rates.
I paid a conference rate of Can$179 plus the various taxes and fees - this seemed a little high for what it was, although realistically I blame the US$ more than Marriott for this perception.
I have stayed here on two occasions with family and friends and really enjoyed both visits!!
We book the Romance Package and it is well worth it.
They have other great packages including one that gives you a $25 gas coupon or gift card for the mall.

We have prevoiusly stayed at 3 or 4 other hotels in Toronto over the last year at around the same price.
This hotel was amazing for the rate.
Very clean, comfortable all over.
Great pool (warm and clean) and hot tub (the cleaning guy let us stay late that evening - thank you!)
The hotel is connected to the Eaton center = dangerous!!!
Overall, I would definetly go back in a heartbeat and I will recommend this hotel to friends and family planning on staying downtown.
I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to friends.
All in all- really nice stay.
On the last night I got some loud young neighbors.
They got louder as the night progressed and started to smoke.
Of course they party youngsters gave them the run around.
Their party finished at 4am, and ruined my last night!
No mini-bar.
Really?
It's also connected directly to the Eaton Centre for easy access to the mall...it that's your thing.
I would highly recommend this hotel.
Our rate due to the conference was very reasonable so no complaints.
The Eaton Shopping centre can be easily reached from the hotel.
I cant believe that we stayed in the same hotel as the other people who have reviewed this place.
We enjoyed our stay both times.
We had two days of cold rain but from Eaton Centre you can follow the PATH all over downtown and not go out side.
We will definitely be going back.
stayed for conference at the sheraton centre - which was a short walk (less than 5 minutes) away.
if you wanted to you could get there via the mall and the walk undergound.
i think this is a good value for the area except for the internet charges which were high for such a slow connection.
I recently attended an annual work conference from the 17th thru 19th and I have to say that I was very pleased with the hotel.

(great deal).
Overall wonderful stay, will book again when I return to town.
I had to book at the last minute and was able to get an excellent internet rate over the weekend days.
Amazing location and accessible to Eaton Centre.
Special thanks to Danny for being so nice with the kids he was awesome!
We can't wait to come back!

When I called to cancel, rather than just accept my cancellation request and take the money (I prepaid a nonrefunable sum for the room), they directed me to a manager person, who immediately heard my concerns and showed me objective evidence of what measures were taken to ensure that no bedbugs were in this hotel.
This was not my experience at other hotels, and I have since stopped using these websites, preferring to talk directly with the hotels.
Overall, it was a perfectly nice stay.
I think I must have missed what most people rave about.
The rate was a little high, but the location is quite good.
We arrived particularly late due to a flight delay so were checked in quickly which was appreciated.
Check out was again quick and our bags were stored by a lovely, friendly concierge.
Upon returning to the hotel we were helped with our bags into a car that the hotel ordered for us and on our way.
All in all a great (if very quick) stay in a hotel with a great location.
Would recommend.
just terrific.
There was a safe large enough to fit my laptop in, something I always struggle with at other hotels.
I asked for a late check out which was granted to me free of charge.
We experienced no problems in this area -- like we usually do in other hotels.
Check in literally took 2 minutes and we were on our way upstairs.
There was a hallway that connected to the Eaton Centre.
of a Sears store, which is a little weird...but other than that, it was handy.
It was overall a wonderful experience - I'd highly recommend it to anyone.
I felt spoiled while I was there
All in all, a pleasant stay.
My boyfriend is partial to the Marriott chain, so when we booked to stay here we came with high expectations.
We werenâ€™t disappointed.
We had no issue with noise, and we slept really well.
Really liked my stay, it's right next to Eaton Ctr, room was spacious and modern.
I got an extra couple of hours for a late check-out, so that was nice of them too.
Highly recommend.
