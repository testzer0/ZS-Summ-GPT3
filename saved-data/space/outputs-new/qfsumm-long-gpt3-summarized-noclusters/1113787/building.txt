***** Model produced summary *****
The hotel is around 40 minutes from DFW airport in downtown Dallas. The front desks are not huge, but has a fairly open seating and meeting place. The room was spacious enough, with a big glass wall on the outside, a 42" flat screen TV, and terrific lighting arrangements that allowed you to adjust the brightness in various parts of the room. The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.

Absolutely beautiful property, rooms are spacious and modern, and the roof-top pool area is excellent. Their fitness facilities were nice, with plenty of aerobic equipment and enough weights to get a nice workout. The inside is very modern and sleek; the room had a sexy contemporary decor.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
The front deks area is not huge, but has a farily open seating and meeting place.
There are a lot of office buildings, but the place really seems to die down after 5 PM.
When we first arrived there was tea and cookies in the lobby waiting for all of the guest, with a fantastic array of decorations in the lobby.
When we spoke to one of the front desk clerks they said it used to be a bank and it was to be designed along the lines of natural elements such as wind and water.
Be warned, the building next door is under construction (which I am sure is temporary).
The inside is very modern and sleek.
Lobby is very nice, if a bit "tries to hard" and dark.
I opened my curtains to a view of the construction site.
The owner is an art collector so the lobby was decorated with pieces from his own personal collection.
If you go ask the front desk about it.
The Joule is touted as a luxury property.
In addition to all of their extra assistance and care, the facilities are phenomenal.
We were looking for something that combined elegance, art, and architecture.
The actual property is a laid back luxurious gem and exceeded our expectations.
Better investment!!
(But what's with the big wooden wheel in the lobby?)
It was essentially a "funky" modern look that suited us great.
We used the house car, a Cadillac Escalade which took us around, nice touch but the car wasnt as clean as it should have been and the driver didnt seem like he wanted to take us.
The design and decor is incredible.
There was damage to the hood and front bumper which was not present when we left the car the previous night.
I wish they would have told me when they did this".
The smell when you walked into the lobby was breathtaking...the fragrance was wonderful.
Funky but yet classy and comfortable.
Even if you just go into the lobby and get a drink at the hotel bar it is worth it.
There is a giant gear in the lobby (floor to ceiling, turning another gear in the ceiling - just have to see it).
My guests were so intrigued by the history and architecture.
We used the free car service several times and the drivers all had great recommendations for places to go and to eat.
The very nicely decorated lobby says a lot about this hotel.
The furniture was nice, the bed was extremely comfortable, and I loved the lighting system.
It was still hanging on the door handle.
Inside we were greeted again by the ambassador Shaye.
The entire downtown area was wonderful and I truely do look forward to trying to come back for a more leisure visit.
Chasity actually took the time to explain the art throughout the hotel and how the owner put his own personal touch on the property.
