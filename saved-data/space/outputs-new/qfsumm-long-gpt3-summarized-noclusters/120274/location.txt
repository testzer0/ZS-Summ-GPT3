The location of the hotel is a little out of the way for Universal, Prime Outlets (formerly Beltz), IDrive etc but it's only 5 minutes from Disney, you can see the top of Expedition Everest from the car park at the back!
***** Golden Review 1 *****
This hotel has a good location, plenty of restaurants nearby and easy access to major routes. It is within walking distance of Super Target, Olive Garden, Publix you name it!
***** Golden Review 2 *****
It was a good location, plenty of restaurants nearby and easy access to major routes. It's very close to Super Target, Olive Garden, and Publix. It's in a good place to fuel up for the long days at the parks.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The hotel had a great location with access to routes through the city; it was close enough to walk to Super Target, Olive Garden, and Publix for example.

The location to Disney is ideal & for the amount of time spent in your room I find this hotel ideal, at a bargain price.
I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.
The good...the place was close to the main entrance to Disney and lots of food choices nearby to eat.
I stayed at a nice resort the week before and thought I remembered this one but it turns out...it was the hotel next door I should have reserved.
The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
The hotel is actually in a good position on the 192 highway, really near to disney & close to lots of good places to eat - red lobster was the best it was just across the road.
we really enjoyed our holiday at this hotel, it was far better than we expected for the price we paid.
I mean what hotel have you ever been to where there wasn't a clock?
They even charge to get ice for your room, $0.25cents.
It is located on 192 which is close to everything which is nice but I would say to stay somewhere else, somewhere with basic amenities for the same budget price.
I needed a place to stay for 3 nights before I could get into my villa rental and at a total price of $123 this suited me very well.
Being situated right off Hwy 192 makes this location extremely central.
Booked this hotel as part of a package through Hotwire.
Don't know where the rental cars were located?!?!?
The only okay thing about the hotel was the location.
5 minutes to Disney.
20 minutes to Universal.
However the best bit of this hotel is by far the location, just 2 mile from Disney and surrounded by quality restaurants and shops, you can not go wrong.
It was simple, great location.
The location is really good, it is across the street from a supermarket restaurants and other useful things.
Spent a week at this hotel while we visited the Orlando area and parks.
There was plently of parking and the first room they put us in was clean and tidy, however a bit dark.
So we asked to get moved and this was not a problem.
The hotel is situated aound 10 mins from disney world.
All in all, this is the perfect hotel if you are intending to visit the parks every day and just have somewhere to rest your head at night.
check in was fast & friendly,location is close to shopping,10 min from disney,15 min from universal & seaworld,1 hr from daytona & cape kennedy.
The hotel is not very hard to find.
The directions given by the hotel staff were very clear.
My partner and i booked this hotel three weeks before arriving.
All in all it was a great break, no complaints whatsoever.
There are plenty of other shops & restaurants around the hotel.
Shuttle bus to parks (didn't use).
Rooms were clean, grounds were clean, staff was friendly.
It was a good location, plenty of restaurants nearby and easy access to major routes The heated swimming pool was lovely with fresh towels piled high.
You walk on the carpet just feels so sticky.. About the location, compared to the other on celebrations area, seems not so close to those theme parks.
Fantastic location wit restaurants, gift shops etc all within walking distance of the hotel (I did the whole thing on foot as I don't drive).
Located 2 miles from Interstate 4 and one mile from Disney entrances, the hotel is ideal for those going to Disney.
Ample parking and the rooms were promptly made up each day.
We booked through First Choice and they really should not be selling this place to customers.
There are much better places to stay in the area, I would suggest the well known chains.
with a couple of tables and chairs.. you had to fight to get a seat..
On a better note... the hotel is in a good location and just down the road is a cafe thing where you can get an all you can eat buffet breakfast for very cheap, which served loads of fruit, cakes, a fry up, pretty much anything.
The hotel is only 5 mins away from the attrattions which was excellent.
It was easy and simple, a place to hang your hat.
Its really close to everything in Disney....
I went down to get some ice and found I needed to return to the room to obtain a quarter... ice was not free.
Location is excellent, near Walgreens.. Outback and TGI's.
The road leading out onto the back exit takes you to Disney in 5 minutes flat!!
On arrival the hotel was really easy to find, marker 4 on highway 192, our sat nav brought up Quality inn westgate which is the hotels old name.
Free shuttle rides to ALL theme parks.
We ate at a steakhouse close by called the colorado house of beef , it will ring you up about 70$ for two , and you eat well , with good service.
This hotel is located near Disney World (20 min.
drive, w/ slight traffic) and W Irlo Bronson Highway (192), where there must be 100s of restaurants and attractions you can go to on that highway.
Just use this hotel as a base for the theme parks, save your money too and buy discounted theme park tickets from Wal-Mart.
Grounds and pool were kept clean.
Free shuttle to parks.
The location is superb - close to restaurants, supermarkets and Disney.
The hotel is situated literally a stone throw from the disney resort and our room was facing the animal kingdom & we could watch the fireworks from our door.
In short don't expect a flash, fancy place but do expect somewhere cosy to get your head down at night that's clean and friendly.
Located on a loud busy road frequantly used by the local fire departmentand large lorries, Constant pestering from the ticket stand to sell you a timeshare and tickets.
(toasts and cereals).The location of the Hotel is not too far from theme parks.
It was only a 5 minute drive from disney and a 20 minute drive from Universal.
It is also close to lcal shops and there was a TGI, Outback Steak house just over the road.
The location was very good - just a five minute drive to Disney.
We stayed at this hotel since it was reasonably close to the Disney parks.
It was pretty easy to get around to good restaurants and stores.
It was almost directly across the street from Outback Steakhouse.
One block away from Golden Corral too.
One block to Dennys and Walgreens.
Please note, although I booked online directly through the companyâ€™s website, I have been informed that it was a third party transaction and they WILL NOT cancel my reservation without the confirmation number which i do not have, yet they can see my reservation in front of them.
The location couldn't be better and there are lots of restaurants around the hotel.
We left early to get to the parks and arrived back late after shopping at the outlets, so it did us for a week.
All in all its a basic clean hotel in a good location to all parks and restaurants.
We would stay here again, if you want more luxury it is not for you, if you want a clean safe place and conveniently located for parks then its perfect!
We stayed there (2 adults,1 child of four ) having previously stayed at the masters inn up the road.
Superb location for Disney with a back road out of the hotel that cuts out all the queues on the 192.
On that occasion we stayed for 2 weeks.
There's a Walmart and a Target store about 20 minutes West from the hotel, some shopping arease (groceries, pharmacy etc) are closer by.
The one thing I was a bit 'meh' about; you have to pay for ice.
Not much, but you have to bring a quarter to fill your ice-bucket, annoying if you don't know this and have to walk back to your room to find change.
Other than the small annoyance with the room on checking in and the icemachine, I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.
The price is right, and the location is super!
Only booked our stay 6 weeks before our trip from UK travel agent.
The hotel is well situated for all the theme parks especially the Disney parks and there are plenty of shops and other attractions in the local area.
Pros: - The room was spacy & clean - The pool was warm and fun to swim in - Friendly staff - Good location (next to some great shops!)
P.s sanford airport hasnt got scales to weigh cases before you check in!!
We are a family of 5.
The location was great.
5 minutes from Animal Kingdom gate using back road called Sherberth.
We were on the 3rd floor backside of hotel therefore no noise from above and very little walking by or from road.
Walking distance to grocery, pharmacy, and restaurants.
Very close to Super Target, Olive Garden, Publix you name it!
I did phone a couple of days prior to our arrival to secure the items that I had requested via our internet reservation.
Location was great.
Walking distance to many restaurants and shopping.
The hotel is about 10 minutes from Disney and 20 from Universal or Sea World.
I highly recommend Clearwater beach!
The water is warm and the sand is very soft and white.
Has to be the worst place I ever stayed.
It's not the best location as you do need to drive everywhere but that was all part of the fun for us!!
In saying that, just across the road you have TGI Fridays, Subway, supermarkets, mini golf and a few other shops.
Upon arrival, we had to pay an additional "resort fee" of 97c per room per day, which covered the safe and pool usage etc, but having paid only Â£19 per room per night, we didn't really complain at that.
It wasn't a problem though, and I didn't even report it to reception.
The location is excellent - this end of the 192 is like a miniature (but busier) version of International Drive!!
BUT personally i always stay clear of international drive as i find it quite run down and too busy............if you enjoy the 192 area of kissimee then this hotel is fine!
The parking lot was clean, the location of the hotel was GREAT (right next to many restaraunts, souvenier shops, and within 5 minutes to the Disnet World Parks).
We choose to eat elsewhere, as we wanted to be fueled up for our day long trip to Magic Kingdom.
Upon arriving at the motel I was asked to pay the resort fee which I knew about and indeed most of the motels charge this or charge you for the safe in your room which amounts to around the same thing.
the hotel is on the main strip but once you close your door you dont hear any noise from traffic etc .
this hotel is ideally located for disney as there is a road out of the back of the hotel which is a short cut to disney world , turn right out of rear of hotel , left at t junction 2 mins later you are on disney , right by animal kingdom .
overall a great holiday and would return again , any questions regarding orlando and this area please email me and i will try and help i have been 4 times in 3 years and going back again real soon
We had a fantastic time in florida.
Although this is by no means a luxurious residence, it is a perfect place to stay if you are intending to visit the theme parks, although a car is essential.
Booked last minute through first choice websie as a lads holiday - Â£303pp B&B for 7 nights, flights from Manchester and Hire Car incl.
Hire car and drive from Sanford - ok, but be aware this hotel has changed name and the directions given by First Choice still refer to the old name.
Location was good - on the 192, 5mins from Interstate 4 - 40mins sea world and universal, 1hr to Busch Gardens, 1hr 15 to Kennedy Space Center.
Firstly, reception won't really care as we found them quite surely and unhelpful, and secondly the rooms are not gleaming and smelling of rose petals!
