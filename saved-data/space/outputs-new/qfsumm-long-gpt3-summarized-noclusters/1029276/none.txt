The reviews said that the food was fine if you were a business traveler, but that it was very pricey if you were staying there for holidays. They also said that the staff was excellent.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The breakfast was generally very good , although it was the same every day, and sometimes reported as cold. Complimentary coffee, fruit, and bottled water were offered once one exists the elevator in the morning into the lobby. The restaurant on the main level was excellent, had a variety of food and drinks. The breakfast buffet was expensive.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The noninclusive continental breakfast buffet is expensive at $20, but it's worth it. Complimentary coffee, fruit, and bottled water are also available once one exits the elevator in the morning into the lobby.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
Complimentary coffee, fruit, and bottled water were offered at the Hilton Miami Downtown. The breakfast buffet wasn't complimentary but it was well worth the $20.00.

Though I found the hotel very pricey (for us) I'm sure you could get a much better rate on line.
Since we paid $210 for the night I thought we'd get free parking - we used the valet service for $28 (plus tips) which we found pricey also.
We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.
The food at the restaurant was excellent and the service was great.
There is no food or entertainment around.
Also, the food was far above the standard conference selection.
My girlfriend and I got it for a great price.
Coffee was amazing.
We were able to grab some bottles of water and fruit on our way out for the day.

Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.
Just need to watch out for all the greedy homeless people outside.
It tool almost 30 min to make some food an no one else was there other than the homeless people that kept asking to get their cup refilled for them.
The food is decent, nothing great, but Bayside is just a short drive or 20 min.
walk in one direction and there are more places to eat in the other direction.
We wanted to get dessert to take to our room.
for the price, it's OK, nothing more.
On both nghts we have waited for 20 minutes or more for our drinks.
The first night our food orders took forever and tonight I never got my slice of pie and our second round of drinks never arrived.
There was one occasion in which we ordered from the menu, sadly it was a little disappointing because it was overcooked but we were taken care of almost immediately when we complained.
We had a snack in the lounge as that's all that was available.
It was almost uneatable, but we were hungry.
Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
Breakfast was cold, room service was OK. As I'm writing this review, we've been without water - the entire hotel - for more than 3 hours.
There are just a few fast-food eateries near the entrance of the hotel.
The banquet food was fabulous and themed menus were creative and well presented.
I loved the shrimp and crab claws.
I had a great burger and beer at the lobby bar upon arrival and felt like the staff was very friendly in all departments.
I had a great burger and beer at the lobby bar upon arrival and felt like the staff was very friendly in all departments.
The hotel is very clean, the staff professional - and the food - simply amazing.
What I got was beyond what I expected - I was stuffed to the brim.
Just used the lounge for snack in the early evening and breakfast the next morning.
We had lunch one day and breakfast another
There was a problem with heating system, but it seems it was the first time ever they need it...
Heating quite noisy.
A little bit pricy but you are staying at Hilton, so you expected to pay a bit more.
In addition, it did not enough tea bags for two people.
Kendall Jackson and BV were about it.
For such an international city I thought there would be more attention paid to international wines, but that's my thing so...
The drinks and food are pricey in the hotel, but then again in Miami everything seems to be expensive.
The drinks and food are pricey in the hotel, but then again in Miami everything seems to be expensive.
There are fast food places to eat right across the street, you would have to drive a few blocks for a good place to eat.
I could have spent less in the end and stayed somewhere else.
I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
I also enjoyed the Lounge and food there.
Food during the meeting was very good.
Lounge lacked bottles of water!
Other food in the lounge was good (fruit, coffee).
When we arrived, only option for a meal was at the bar in the lobby.
Horrible club sandwich!
Cold fat soaked bacon, processed meats, and very expensive.
Recommendation: eat elsewhere; even room service would probably have been better.
Once coffee machine was used it was not replenished, even after a request to staff.
Food: seriously excellent snapper, bomb key lime pie.
Again conference food just ok though, damn those $16 DOJ muffins Rooms a are good, big tvs, comfy beds, nice setup.
Too many hobos and drug addicts!!!
Also a salad place and sandwich shop just past 19th St (hotel is on 16th).
$28 in this economy??
Had a great internet deal we found on hilton.com for the website, so we were able to stay there for under $65 a night.
The manager called and said the water was safe and we explained we did not feel comfortable bathing and brushing our teeth in green water.
***** Model produced summary *****
The reviewers thought that the Hilton Miami Downtown was fine for business travelers, but found it very expensive and not ideal for holidays. They also had complaints about the housekeeping only supplying towels for three people per day, despite there being four people in the room.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
I bit too much for the USA and the quality is mediocre at best.
I must say we were extremely disappointed with our stay there.
We were pleased until the day of check out when we dealt with an â€œassistant front desk managerâ€� who gave us trouble with our reimbursement.
Cannot even charge to room account.
We have to stand around for about two hours before being checked in.
Overall the stay at this Hotel was satisfactory.
A huge group of teenagers were staying in the hotel, and kids were all over the place until late at night...flooding the lobby, elevators, and public space.
I finally had to take my drink from the bar to my room as a result of all of the noise and lack of supervision.
Kids were in the hallway during the night slamming doors and making noise.
Stayed here for 2 nights - excellent value for money!
I love love love it!!!
Thank you all for making our stay unique!!!
I would love to enjoy that when i return.
This is definetely not my last time here!!
We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Miami Downtown.
It pays to have be a Gold member of Hilton Honors.
What more could we ask!
Working with Domingo in sales was the best part about this.
He consistently had suggestions that were perfect.
I don't generally plan events for work and so Domingo took the helm and provided the direction needed.
Excellent value.
I won't restate what has been said in earlier reviews.
There is no police presence...ever!
They don't get off they just ride in circles and look for trouble.
There were two young girls on board that were terrified...I told them to get off the tram with me--they did and I put them in a cab to their hotel.
I have been travelling to Miami for years and it just gets worse every year.
Huh?
So, if you are staying one night and then heading to the cruise terminal it is fine...anything more than that look at a more upscale place in a better area of town.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the AC worked beautifully.
The value is terrific and attention makes it even more stellar.
A quick stroll in the morning up 5 blocks to the tiled Barcardi building is worthwhile.
cons: the first floor was for moter.
TV was not functioning properly.
My two daughters and I stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise.
I called to thank Christopher and he even remembered that my girls had birthdays and sent up some treats for them.
Thank you so much!!
I was a bit worried from the reviews about the Hilton.
After staying there, I think some of these people that complain either are used to staying at the Ritz-Carlton or just too damn picky.
We got there on Thursday night and didn't have to stand in any lines to check in.
It really was not that bad if you had 2-3 minutes of patience.
On check in the room I was assigned was very smoky smelling but they moved me to a suite with a better view.
After reading all the bad reviews I expected a real dump.
That was not the case although this is not a hotel you want to book for a special occasion.
Nothing special though.
I would recommend this hotel and I would stay myself there anytime.
The views of the skyline and the port are terrific.
Stayed here during re NBA finals.
He forgot I gave him a few dollars the day before.
Also DO NOT GO TO THE RALLY'S ACROSS THE STREET.
!
Stayed post cruise for 1 night only.
Wished we had longer to stay.
The rooms overlooking the bay have fantastic views.
We all know hotel phones are pricey, so we kept the calls short, but even still - the rates aren't advertised anywhere in the room.
Really abusive.
Where do I start?
Checking was fine and the room view was outstanding...that's the good.
I just smiled and went to work.
My lesson!
Don't make the same mistake I did.
I was skeptical of the quality because of the great rates.
First impressions count.
Huge windows with great views.
This hotel should definately be rated higher.
I too saw a number of marginal comments however I stayed at the hotel in the begining of October.
If you are not the type of person who is trying to find something wrong, you will love this place.
It cost me 6.00 one way.
The complaints you see are not accurate.
Now, if you are a person who can find something wrong at any hotel than do not stay here.
Because you will complain that the elevators are slow....that the elevators are warm....It will always be something and frankly you would complain if you were given the room for free.
If you are complaining about anything in your room, get a life.
!
The overwhelming number of people just means that everything takes a little longer.
Definitely worth the money.
So it is impossible to complain about that!
We will be back for sure.
Thanks for a great stay!!
!
When we arrived for a one night stay, (we were catching a cruise ship the next morning) the one bell hop at the entrance did not greet us, or offer to help, or open a door.
He seemed to be busy counting his tips.
The young man at the check in desk was very helpful but was new, as he sounded so scripted as if he had memorised all his lines.
There is tansit police around but not everywhere.
We had a great time.Parking is expensive.
For me, it's the little details that make a hotel worth the money, and the Hilton just doesn't have the attention to detail that a hotel of its caliber should.
Maybe other hotels do this, too, but I haven't experienced it.
Will I be charged extra for that?
Soon.
Now, I don't expect Hilton to be able to control emergencies like this, but I mention it only as another point of frustration with this place.
In a city like Miami, I'm sure there are better places to stay.
Stayed there for a business conference and have to say I was less than impressed.
Everything was just about average.
The sheets and pillows are excellent for a good night sleep.
As we arrived we parked on the street, there was constructiono but being that we live on Sobe we knew the area and parking area well...so we avoided the $29 valet parking per day....We were greeted by Andrew, excellent front desk person who gave us a room on the high floor....I told him it was my birthday weekend and he tried to make it very special for me and my family...we then went to lobby to wait for room, excellent service also...The service at every place we went was superb...i even thought i wasn't in Miami...lol..everyone super friendly....the pool bartender also....In the executive lounge, service was great too...nothing to complaint....our room had a great view of the port and bayside also miami beach and the bed was amazing.......
I would definitely go back.
I would still stay again now that I know what to expect.
I was not looking forward to staying at this hotel after reading the bad reviews ,but i have to say that we really enjoyed our two night stay.
I would have to say don't be put off by the bad reviews about the hotel.
so the feel/atmosphere is different from other Hilton (business) hotel.
If you can get a good deal...I say go for it.
Rates are valid as of this posting.
Nothing to complain.
The neighbor was a bit loud in the music playing but it goes with the connecting room so I can't really complain too much.
Then I smelled cigarette smoke leaking through the connecting door.
The smell gets stronger and stronger and I have a preganent wife and a small child so I called front desk and confirmed the hotel is a 100% smoke-free hotel and told them about the smoke.
The manager was quick to investigate with security staff.
Overall, it was a very nice stay with excellent services.
and there we met Luis who was very friendly and polite, always smiling and as it was our first time in miami he kindly answer ALL of our questions.
I would go and would stay again without any doubts.
All five of them.
I'm a hhonors Diamond member.
The floor to ceiling windows and the private terrace made for spectacular views of downtown Miami as well as the cruise port.
The executive lounge had new Dell computers, wifi internet access was available throughout the hotel (including the pool area) -- free for gold and diamond members.
We were near the lifts and they were noisy all night.
We should have stayed at South Beach area instead.
!
It takes 5-10 minutes to oceans drive with cab or car.
As a matter of fact if you want to spend a few days in central Miami I say go for it.
We had difficulty with the TV the first night and called the front desk.
He was knowleable regarding the TV and needed to make severeal setting changes and everything was working perfect.
I must say my most recent experience at this Hotel has really blown me away.
I stayed here for a 4 day conference.
Overall, was a great stay :)
Two friends and I (three young women) stayed at this hotel during June of this Summer.
During our stay we were sexually harassed by the security guard on duty by the pool.
The next day after I arrived back in Atlanta, I contacted the hotel and left a message for the manger stating that it was about sexual harassment at the hotel...I never received a call back.
The manger (Mr. Pellon) of the hotel did not give an apology, he just said he did to cover his own tracks.
I JUSTreceived an apology on October 3, 2011.
If this harassment has happen to you at this hotel also, please contact me because my attorney will be more than happy to take your case also.
Switching between channels was quite dreadful; the volume was vastly different for every other station.
We witnessed an arrest by hotel security staff after a man refused to leave the motor lobby.
Btw, when you arrive at the hotel, it is quite confusing where the check in is located (2nd floor).
Nice touch.
But the wines by the glass selections could be a bit more varied.
If you like dancing try The Vagabond nightclub within walking distance.
I would definitly stay again, and it was a great experience overall.
Got a great deal on the room through priceline.
I know that the hotel had recently changed ownership but they should have had the hotel information changed with the various booking agents.
$28/day for valet and $25/day self parking...very expensive Blood stains on pillow cases...contacted front desk about the issue and they reacted like it was a normal thing and would mention it to housekeeping.
For the money, there are much better hotels in the area.
The cost of this hotel should be 1/2 of existing for the value.
The reviews for the hotel were terrible.
But I'm happy to say the Miami Hilton met all my needs.
Check in was smooth and courteous except after waiting 20 min for an elevator my keys did not work and I was on a high floor.
Got a new one and all was fine.
I reconfirmed this request prior to arrival.
After a very poor nights sleep he offered to refund the points for the rooms.
While the offer of refunding the points was nice, it would have actually been netter if they followed though on that promise!.
After several e-mails they responded they were only refunding a single room.
I attended a conference at this hotel for 2 days.
No missed wake up calls!
I must say my first impressions were not good, but the hotel staff made efforts to improve my stay.
Got in late and check in was a nightmare.
Really have never been through a slower check in - problem was that I was behind about 25 foreign tourists, which is what appears to make up the majority of this hotel's clientel.
Stayed one night on way to cruise.
The poor gentleman who arrived with our sheets had NO idea how to make a bed, he started putting the blanket on the mattress (before the sheets) when I told him he could leave.
It was NOT good.
Zary Rosenfeld Room 1125 IN 3/12 out 3/16/2012
Check in was very nice, after being in the room for sometime, my elderly mother in law reached under the pillow to discover a used " prophylactic" .
Housekeeping came up and changed out the sheets, but the vision never went away.
The next morning the hotel manager was "unavailable" to speak to us, but the gentleman at the counter said he would " refund our money " from the cruise package to us.
As of today, we have not heard anything from the hotel or the cruise line to confirm this.
Stayed one night before boarding a cruise ship.
As a Hilton gold member, had access to the lounge, and free internet in room.
We got a Bayview room and it came with incredible views of the Miami Skyline.
I also liked that they were dog friendly.
I took my Pekingese with me and she loved the beds (slept comfortably) and the floor to ceiling windows.
Paid for newspapers - got 2 out of 4.
We had a small group and received a decent price for the weekend.
Spent 6 days here for a conference and workshop.
Conference setup is typical but decent.
Overall really happy with our stay, apart from one crappy bathroom light switch that took all your body weight to activate...
Absolutely nothing to complain about rooms (modern and with huge widescreen tv) and service: the express check out on the phone, in a busy day of meeting and conferences, saved me a lot of time.
In downtown Miami I would probably come back here.
Our only gripe was the area... We live in the NE of England so are used to a bit of rough and tumble but upon leaving the hotel each time we felt really uneasy!!!
!
Stay here if you enjoy sleeping with loud music.
We had very loud booming music until 1:00am, not easy to fall asleep with that going on.
We are looking forward to returning.We highly recommend this Hilton.
They are pigs!
Regular Miami traveller here.
Can't hear the old-style TV (?)
when it comes on.
Have not tried the hotel offerings yet.
You have to be kidding!
You'll see the signs - much, much less expensive.
We'd stay there again w/o a 2nd thought.
Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
Air conditioning noise is horrendous.
kept you awake all night.
We checked in and later that night I wanted to have a bath.
We waited an hour and got impatient because it was midnight.
We asked for a discount or something and he said he would drop off some breakfast vouchers.
What an ordeal.
What an insult.
