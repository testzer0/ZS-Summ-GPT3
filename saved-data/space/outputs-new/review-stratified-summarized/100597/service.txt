Part 1 of 5: The reviews said that the service was slow and that the waiter seemed bothered by having to serve the customers.

There were also reports of items not being delivered as requested, and Robert immediately stepped in front of my husband and folded his arms and gave my husband many excuses why it was our fault we didn't have the bed yet.

***** Sentences in Cluster ****
The staff was friendly and we appreciated the cookies after a long flight when we were waiting to check inn.
Shuttle was convenient and would definitely stay here again.
I think it is fair to mention it costs to use internet in your room but for business travlers I suppose that is an expected cost.
Great friendly staff took the edge off our long day of intercontinental travel.
It has "small hotel" service, meaning that you don't feel lost and they treat you well.
The service in both the casual restaurant at breakfast and the dining room in the evening was efficient.
Looks like they are trying to keep up with on-going updating and maintenance.
Lots of airline personnel stay here as well.

The staff was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed the warm, chocolate chip cookie we were given at check-in.
Shuttle service is very quick and so great!
Especially with the shuttle service.
Due to security, I did not think this was a good idea for a single female traveler, however, I did not want to 'make waves' and request another room as I was only there for one night.
If something might goes awry, the staff are quick to correct and aim to provide a memorable stay that makes you want to return.
We have stayed at Hotels that are many times more expensive yet the staff are nowhere near as impressive as the Doubletree.
The Wynn in Las Vegas should sign up for tutoring to learn how to treat customers.
Perhaps then their vacancy rate would dwindle!
The staff are exceptional and the quality without question.
What they didn't tell us when booking on the website is that the parking is $16 per night and the internet in the rooms is not wireless.
One thing I have learned about traveling is that to bring your own router just in case there isn't wireless.
Especially when more than one person in the room has a computer.
We felt safe and secure with our small children.
The hotel employees were very polite and most efficient: we were on our way to our room within 30 seconds, warm cookies in hand.

After driving up and down International Bl.
I booked a post-cruise package and the staff did not know how that worked.
They offer shuttle service (sporadically) and even though I was outside in plenty of time, at least 40 people showed up to try and get into a VAN.
I took a taxi as everyone was trying to cram into the shuttle with no respect for first-come-first-served.
Room service was good, however.
Staff wise, this hotel also needs renovation.
Service in the more upscale of the two restaurants was almost unbearably slow and the food was cold when it finally arrived after over a hour at our table.
The shuttle runs 24 hours per day, and it makes about three trips per hour (no phone call or reservation is needed).
If you don't want to wait, a good alternative is the nearby taxi stand; fare to the Doubletree should be less than $10 because of the hotel's proximity to the airport.
The staff are wonderful!
They are dedicated and helpful to your every need.
Coffee shop service was horrible.
Waited forever to be seated and there were only 3 others in the place.
Waitress never brought the items we requested and the order was askew.
We had to go searching for our check to pay it.
I also used the business center, but the computers were slow and ran an old version of software; one printer worked but the other didn't.
Frustrated - we called front desk - who called security - who called maintenance.
Also, wished to have their shuttle drop us off @ transit terminal but we were told to wait - we decided to walk and it was rather cold.
We stay here and go to Seattle for Mariners games.

I did email Rissa, who took a day and a half (and two emails) to respond to me.
She said all the blahblahblah and offered to change rooms, but I was halfway through my stay and changing rooms is a pain.
This was a business trip so I was not looking for compensation on the room.

The service at the hotel coffee shop was really slow and the waiter seemed really bothered by having to come to our table to see what we wanted.

Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out.
In fact, the free shuttle probably spends more time driving back to the hotel than it would probably take to just walk back across the street.
We utilized the free airport shuttle, which is handy, but did not use any other hotel service.
The shuttle getting from the airport to the hotel was very croweded and hot (yes hot for Seattle) and smelled.
They told us to go across the street.
The shuttle only runs on the hour, not every half an hour like you would assume from an airport hotel.
So we almost missed our flight.
By the time the shuttle was prepared to leave on the hour there were to many people to fit in the shuttle(they could have run there & back in that time ).
The shuttle was hot and smelly again and people were mad.
The staff went around the lines of people handing out the essentials of shaving foam, razors, toothpaste, toothbrushes and home made cookies as we didn't have our luggage which was checked into the cancelled flight.

If I had been wanting to stay for more than one night, be close to anything interesting (other than the artificially created world of SEATAC), or wanted to get some business done, this would not have been the best hotel.
Other than that, I was greeted very nicely and professionally at the desk by a staff member that had a very irate customer on the phone, in spite of him trying his best from the portion of the conversation I heard, he continued to handle himself in a professional manner, then when he place the caller on hold to assist me, was very courteous and professional.
I am grateful she was quick.

It may be a profit center, but when Best Western gives free internet, it is time to change the policy.
When we returned about 10 hours later nothing had been done.
We were offered a change of room and the assistance of a three man team to move.

I was disappointed to learn there was a fee for parking ($16+tax), a fee for Internet ($5 for one hour), no simple breakfast included.
