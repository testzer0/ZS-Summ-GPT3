***** Model produced summary in the 1st round *****
Part 1 of 4: The building's exterior is uninviting, and the front desk staff is unprofessional and unhelpful. The rooms are cold and the roll-a-way beds are not comfortable. The overall property is a mess.
Part 2 of 4: The building has an external glass elevator and one wing is currently being renovated. The lobby is open 24 hours and the exterior of the building looks outdated.
Part 3 of 4: The hotel is large with several buildings, and the walk from the farthest building to the lobby is only a few minutes. There are plenty of gardens around the property, and the design of the hotel is both beautiful and maze-like. The beds are comfortable and the showers are great, but the floors can be cold. The main tower is the best place to stay, as it is close to everything. There is a PC in the lobby with a printer to help guests check in to their flights and print boarding passes.
Part 4 of 4: The building was said to have unique architecture, which can be challenging to navigate for some people. The gift shop was well-stocked and reasonably priced.

***** Golden Review 1 *****
The historical hotel lobby were very attractive. The balcony had a great view of trees . The spa and heated pool is a kid-friendly area and also has wi-fi. There is even a laundry room available to the guests.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
Hotel with very nice lobby and relaxing spa/pool area with lounge and free wifi. The pool is big and kid-friendly. There is also a beautiful view of the trees from the balcony.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
Warm, beautiful, large pool for the family. Old fashioned interior but pleasant rooms, great balcony, and the view outside to the trees was relaxing.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
Several fireplaces and seating areas in the lobby make it comfortable.
Access to the tower is by external glass elevators.
One wing building was closed for renovation.
I went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and I had what I needed - nice touch.
The tower elevators, which run on the exterior of the building, were quite cold.
As a Doubletree, I expected a GOOD three star property for my stay on August 27, 2004.
This is a large property with (I believe) five buildings.
The walk from that building to the lobby is about 2-3 minutes.
Overall this is a good property.
I was put into this property by an airline due to a maintenance issue, although I checked in late at night and had to leave early the next morning, I saw enough that I want to return!
When we arrived we were told by the front desk the roll-a-way would be sent up immediately and would probably be there before we got up to the room.
There is an abundance of gardens in between the different buildings and all were very well maintained and tended.
They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin.
The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms.
The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
The exterior of the buildings in these wings looks like some outdated Polynesian tiki architecture.
It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.
The gift shop was well stocked and very reasonably priced.
Will stay there again in the future.
This property is a mess.
Stayed in the high-rise portion.
Lobby has PC with printer to check in to airline and print boarding pass.
