***** Golden Review 1 *****
The hotel restaurant's food was nicely presented, and sometimes good. However, sometimes it was bland and tasteless, and a bit pricey. The restaurant's clam chowder was good. The breakfast buffet isn't a bad deal for what you get. The fresh cookies given at check in were delicious.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
Food was well presented and some of it was tasty, if a little pricey, but the clam chowder at the restaurant and the breakfast buffet made the trip all the more worth it. Dave's Diner next door was also enjoyable.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
Although some of the food was bland and a little overpriced, the clam chowder was good. The staff even gave out these delicious freshly baked cookies int he reception area and the breakfast buffet is also a great value for what is offered.
