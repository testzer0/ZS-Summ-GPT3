***** Model produced summary *****
The building has a nice lobby with fresh cookies in the evening, an impressive pool and whirlpool area, and is within walking distance of Kensington Market. However, some guests have complained about thin walls, a small and crowded lobby, and a false fire alarm.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The rooms were warm, beautiful, and comfortable. The hotel has a small but cozy lobby with a fireplace, business center, and small market shop. The lobby even has fresh cookies in the evening! The gym, indoor pool, and hot tub are nice and not crowded. Everything is of high quality.

***** Golden Review 3 *****
The hotel has a fireplace within its cozy lobby and everything else was absolutely beautiful. The indoor pool, hot tub, and gym were also high quality.

How easy could it have been for someone else to leave with our truck if they could bring us the wrong car?
The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
(once we figured out how to work all the shower heads) The walls were very thin though-we could really hear our neighbours mini party at 2AM in the morning.
Definately recommend the property.
Nice lobby with fresh cookies in the evening.
The facilities are also better than I have encountered in any hotel.
The only bad things that i can mention are that during my stay another guest decided to set the fire alarm of at 04:30, not a wake up call I want to repeat.
And to CN tower.
Lobby was a little small and at times quite crowded, but once you pass through that it was a non-issue.
There were weird grease marks on the wall as well.
The fire alarm went off in the ENTIRE hotel very early in the morning because someone burned toast.
We had to call the front desk to figure out what exactly was going on.
Never again will I waste money at this property.
We went to wait in the lobby... we were not the only ones!
The lobby was packed with people waiting for their cars.
The hotel had a indoor pool and gym facilities but didn't use them.
The descriptions of the neighborhood other reviewers made in the past are correct: there are some questionable-looking people, but that is just one of the elements of any big city.
The lobby has delicious cookies every afternoon.
We also walked to Kensington Market in 15 minutes or so.
I was there the morning of the false fire alarm and although it was annoying I would rather it be false than for real!
The great space for the pool and whirlpool is , without question, very impressive.
The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
Lobby is great for meeting friends and you can sit and chat there even if you don't want a drink.
We had to rent a car and travel back to US to have key made.
My husband had to drive back following week to Toronto from US after having been on the road for work for four days, to get our car back, that had been sitting underground under the hotel.
I did hear them but maybe I just expect that city hum, having grown up in NY.
The hall was a bit noisy the first night because there were a lot of young adults staying there that night, but they finally quieted down.
The lobby is also small.
As we arrived, I was wondering why the front desk girl was all rushed while we were the only ones checking in.
The place is brand new so everything works just fine.
