***** Model produced summary *****
The building was in poor condition, with dead bugs in the water, a hole in the wall, and chains on the doors. The fire alarms were disabled and the musty odor was horrible.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
This very nice hotel looks good from the exterior. It has swimming pools, hot tubs, and an arcade. The building is very safe, with security cameras. There was a gorgeous painting on the wall and a lovely arch reminiscent of Camelot. However, the rooms were poorly lit.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The hotel is nice from the exterior. Inside, there was a gorgeous painting on the wall and the lovely arch made me feel like a real Geneviere of Camelot. It was a great motel that also had swimming pools, hot tubs and an arcade. The facility is very safe there with security cameras and entrances from the inside.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The exterior of the hotel is nice. On the inside though, the rooms are poorly lit. However, it was safe because of all the security cameras and different entrances. There's a great kitchen with a breakfast buffet and a pool/hot tub open early and closed late.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
We would never go back to this property again, because of the condition of the property, and the bad oders.
However, when we went into the building....the musty odor was horrible, the lobby area was humid as if the air conditioning wasn't on, the elevator smelled musty.
Planning on staying again in July, September and possibly December.
All 3 bldgs are old and need to be updated.. not with paint either...i mean gutted & refinished completely.
There are 3 different buildings in which one can stay, I found it confusing and the building we were in was the a long walk to the Front desk and where breakfast was.
The exterior is very well maintained.
Two buildings have indoor pools whereas the main building has the conference room/ breakfast area.
You could definitly tell that they put some time and money into the renovation.
The lady at the front desk took our credit card and then the phone rang she held up her thumbs and mouthed " Your good to go" So we left the next day we went swimming and about 3:30 someone knocked on the door.
Do not stay in the third building.
The exterior doors had problems locking.
It needs a lot of tender care to restore it back to it's original character.
There were dead bugs floating in the water, a hole in the wall under the window, a piece of wood holding a slide glass door open, chains on other doors that said "this entrance is in need of repairs, sorry for any inconvenience" or something to that affect.
there was one very small, round table and 2 small, straight back chairs.
two nite stands and the armoir for the tv and that was it for the furniture.
The door could hardly clear the toilet.
The landscape is lovely and the buildings are well kept and clean.
When arriving to the motel, both ladies at the office were friendly.
The facility was clean.
I was told the place had been remodeled, I guess they meant new paint which is all dark colors and new carpet.
the characteristic of the furniture and art in the room was excellent.
The fire alarms were all disabled throughout the entire hotel.
There was a gorgeous painting on the wall, the lovely arch made me feel like a real Geneviere of Camelot.
Seems to me the constructors of this building were not playing with a full deck.
Our first two nights were spent at The Stone Castle.
I used the iron and when I pressed the steam button rusty water sprayed all over the shirt I was ironing.
Thank You, Stone Castle for a wonderful stay and if we're ever out that way again, you'll definitely be seeing us back.
DON'T STAY AT STONE CASTLE
We always stay at the Stone Castle.
You can see the new renovation and it is very nice.
The front desk personel were very helpful and we will definatly return
Since this was right after Christmas there weren't many people staying there and half the property was closed off.
The walls are paper thin.
We recommend Stone Castle highly!
We will be staying here again when we return to Branson this summer and fall.
The folks at the front desk had an answer for every question.
All roads to 76 were easily accessed.
