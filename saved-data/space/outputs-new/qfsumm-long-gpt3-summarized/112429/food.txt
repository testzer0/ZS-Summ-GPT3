The reviews were mostly positive, with people praising the food for being good or great. One person was disappointed with the hash browns, but otherwise the reviewers seemed to enjoy the meals they had. There was mention of a late happy hour with good prices, and also of the Paramount's good value for the price.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The Dragonfish restaurant had amazing food and a long running happy hour with small plates.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The Dragonfish has great food. Every day it has a late happy hour for food and select drinks that can't be beat! The prices and drinks are good, as are the small plates. It would be wonderful to have a wider range of menu options to select from for room service. The room service English breakfast and Earl Grey tea was not good.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The downstairs restaurant has amazing food and a wonderful happy hour small plates menu with agreeable prices and better food. If they get busy, the hostess just takes your room number and calls when a table's ready. The breakfast is great as well. The room service is nice and professional, but the range of menu options and tea aren't great.
