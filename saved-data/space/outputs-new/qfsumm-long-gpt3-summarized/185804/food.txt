The reviewers said that the food at the hotel was excellent, both in terms of room service and in the restaurants. They also said that there were plenty of excellent places to eat fresh seafood on the island.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The restaurant food ranges from delicious and superb to pretty good and just o.k, but mostly seems to be greatly enjoyed. They have a microbrewery on site. The room service is also excellent.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
Coupled with great service, the food is excellent in the restaurant downstairs.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
Food from room service as well as Dockside restaurant was good.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
They asked me if I wouldn’t mind waiting as they offered to make it from scratch… highly worth the wait.
The food is excellent and the view is amazing.
Luckily we had our own wine, and raided the mini bar for some munchies.

Water Taxi's and walking paths are right there if you want to head out to English Bay or Yaletown.
The market itself is so interesting and the food is wonderful.
For old times sake, we even had lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory, but the food wasn't very good, so we decided to give the city a miss and pootle around the Island instead .
Really rocking and that's not a bad thing eh :) But chasing down something to eat this late on the island was hopeless.
The market is a must go too.
It's a really cool market.
The two water taxis companies serving Granville Island make it very accessible to downtown as well.
I didn't have any meals at the hotel so can't comment on that.
There are several shops and plenty of excellent places to eat FRESH seafood, including the Dockside Restaurant and pub (microbrew).
Food/service was faultless.
I thought the penthouse was well worth the money for a romantic stay compared to the other hotels we considered.
Needed to stay in Vancouver for 3 nights for a health review at UBC.
My husband tried a different beer each night that was micro-brewed at the hotel.
Do people actually still use those liquor fridges?...
There are a variety of options at a reasonable price.
They served everything from made-to-order Eggs Benedict to fruit and pastries to salmon and bacon and fresh-made waffles and...
The food and service were outstanding.
Food is fab too!
We needed to be able to provide some of our own food, so asked to have the mini bar emptied so we could use the fridge, and for a microwave, although it wasn't a regular part of the room.
The food is excellent ( both room service and in the resto) and they have a micro brewery on site.
Our evening snack on the patio was delicious, relaxing and we had a lovely server...again most helpful and obliging...and the view!
The room was beautiful, the staff were very pleasant and the food from the restiarant Downstairs was delicious.
Awesome food, service and view!
However the soap was a good and generous size.
* Way over priced and not the price I had booked online Overall this is a good choice for the location and if it is within your budget, just don't expect too much.
In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.
The food was superb, and the atmosphere is wonderful - right on the water.
Also, there is a brewery on site, and some of the beers were great.
you could easily spend most of your time there since there are lots of restaurants and a fantastic public market featuring lots of food.
quiet at night without the often ugly street level scene you encounter at more glamorous high-rises (yes the high-rises can give you great views but coming out at street level you feel like you've walked into a seedy bus station environment).
The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.
We ate them in the sunshine by the water, looking at the Vancouver skyline.
I expect more considering the price.
The event I attended had a lunch and reception in the restaurant and the food was fantastic.
I probably wouldn't eat there though if I was paying for it myself as the menu was pretty expensive and there are several great places to eat elsewhere on the Island.
We ate at the restaurant for breakfast once and had room service as well.
Both were good.
so that when we bought food to bring back to the room, we had nothing to eat it with.
Food services are excellent.
The food market made me wish I was cooking and not eating out at restaurants!
I disagree: the beers are lightweight.
If you want to visit downtown just take the water taxi or "aqua bus" these little boats are fun, not very expensive and the quickest way to gt there.
It was a bottle of wine with a miniature tuxedo jacket around the bottle.
We shared a steak in a beautiful setting of a table of two with a good view of the waterfront and a candle on the table.
Every day we would get up and walk the short walk to the "Public Market" and have our breakfast or lunch.
We ate there the night before the wedding, and were not disappointed.
Great food and great service.
Basically a food market and some specialist shops.
The market may be unique in North America, but in the UK most towns and cities have a market at least as good.
The beer brewed on the premises was also very good.
The food is acceptable, but don't expect gourmet.
They also have pet friendly rooms with tiled floors.
Being on the water, there is never a lack of things to do or see.
On the weekend, we especially enjoy items on the brunch menu.
The in room breakfast was exceptional and reasonably priced as were the items in the mini-bar.
Right on the water.
take waterbus for a few dollars and go where you like.
Food isnt great but you are right by the market.
