Top 5 statements based on keywords:
1:  It was very clean.
2:  The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
3:  HOUSEKEEPING: Never understood that there were 4 people in the room (room can hold 5) and choose to only put towels for 3 each day we were day (4 days) despite many calls to the front desk.
4:  They also did an extremely lousy job in cleaning the room.
5:  VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
