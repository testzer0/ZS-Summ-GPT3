Top 5 statements based on keywords:
1:  I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.
2:  The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
3:  We asked for more towels and they arrived within minutes.
4:  The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
5:  Staid here during Sakura-Con with a group of teens.
