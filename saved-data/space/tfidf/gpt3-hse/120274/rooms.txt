3:  Complimentary breakfast was mediocre, I'd rather go to some nearby restaurant's breakfast buffets for $4++/person.
4:  The breakfast is served in the lobby area and there are limited tables but you could always eat it in your room or if you don't like what's on offer there are numerous buffet restaurants nearby serving food at prices to suit all pockets.
5:  Lots of restaurnt choices nearby.
