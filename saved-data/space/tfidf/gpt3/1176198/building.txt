1:  We had to call the front desk to figure out what exactly was going on.
2:  The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
3:  The only bad things that i can mention are that during my stay another guest decided to set the fire alarm of at 04:30, not a wake up call I want to repeat.
4:  The fire alarm went off in the ENTIRE hotel very early in the morning because someone burned toast.
5:  I was there the morning of the false fire alarm and although it was annoying I would rather it be false than for real!
