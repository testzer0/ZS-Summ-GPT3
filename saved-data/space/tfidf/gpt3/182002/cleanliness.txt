1:  Played Hotwire roulette and thought that we lost when we were assigned to the Best Western.
2:  Drop off point for luggage check in is pretty small so if anyone is in front of you good luck accessing the hotel front door.
3:  We didnâ€™t run into any problems at the hotel, but unfortunately our trip ended on a sour note as my wifeâ€™s wallet was pickpocketed while we were outside the CN Tower.
4:  We have never been to Canada before or to a huge city like Toronto, we found it very easy to get around, Primrose hotel is an excellent location as the subway is only 5min walk way .There is a lot of restaurants , bars, stores ,drugmarts and shops within walking distance also Dundas sq , Eaton centre &hockey Hall of Fame are close by.
5:  This hotel was not bad at all, check-in was very quick.
