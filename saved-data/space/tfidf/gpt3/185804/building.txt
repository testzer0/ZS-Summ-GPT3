1:  The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
2:  While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
3:  He was very impressed and requested a tour of the brewery, which the brew-master provided for him.
