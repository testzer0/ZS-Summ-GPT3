1. Just returned from three nights in venice . The hotel was so good I had to share it . Beautiful clean rooms venetian Decore . The staff were really friendly and helpful with all our requests . The local area is fabulous with great food and drinks just yards away . Would definitely visit again.
2. We had a superior room that was beautifully decorated. The bathroom had a reasonable shower, although the screen didn't keep water from the floor. The service was excellent - they couldn't do enough to help (Reception/breakfast/night staff). It's in a quieter area, which was good, with easy access from/to the nearest Vaporetto (waterbus) stop (S.Stae - 5 mins walk), or walkable to Rialto etc. Print a detailed map for arrival - without one it's not that easy to find! Would definitely recommend this hotel, and use it again.
3. We stayed at this hotel for one week. The hotel staff at the reception (Carlo & Christina) were more than willing to help us enjoy our visit to Venice. Apparently the building was originally built in the 15th century and was just renovated this year (2010). Our room was spacious and very clean, and our bed was quite comfortable. It is one stop vaporetto ride from the train station. Breakfast was simple but sufficient. MLOttawa
4. Booked after reading Tripadvisor reviews. This hotel has the "wow" factor. It is beautifully decorated and is immaculately clean. The location is so quiet that a good night's sleep is easy . Staff were very warm and welcoming. Our deal had free internet and breakfast - excellent. We were not at all surprised to see the Tripadvisor award on the reception desk. The hotel has not been opened long, but they could give lessons to some on the meaning of "hospitality". We caught the Alilaguna ferry from the airport to "Guglie". We did not see one Traghetto the whole time we were there - there is a crossing near the hotel. For this reason we walked from the ferry stop. When we arrived at the Scalzi bridge (near the railway station) we just had to follow the mustard coloured signs painted high on the walls to the hotel. The first we saw when were atop the Scalzi bridge - look at the wall in front of you and the sign is to the right of the street. Follow the arrows to MUSEU CIVICO di STORIA, Fontego dei Turchi and you will find yourself at the hotel. Look for the red banner. Once there, you will not be disappointed. Congratulations to everyone at the hotel for making our stay in magnificent Venice so memorable!
5. As pictured on the internet, the "red room" is a true indication of spaciousness. Huge and luxurious bedroom and bathroom (both very clean), with deep bath and good water pressure on the shower! Room bright when needed, and dark when necessary. Quiet location, away from the hustle and bustle. Easy to find as it is next to the Natural History Museum. Vaporetto stop on Riva di Biasio approximately 250m from hotel and only one stop from Ferrovia train station. Majer bakery on Calle Larga 100m from hotel - cheap, delicious food, friendly staff. La Zucca, scrumptious vegetarian food approximately 100m from hotel. Fair distance from major sights, though vaporetti are useful for getting around. Breakfast not served until 8am, which is not helpful if you would like an early start to your sightseeing day.
6. The room was sensational, the staff absolutely wonderful. It was within walking distance to everything. Close to a ferry station and had great little restaurants nearby. It is slightly away from the mad tourist central, thank goodness. I am definitely going back. We were celebrating my sisters 50th birthday and the staff sent us to a lovely restaurant, I felt safe and secure everywhere and the hotel certainly helped. It is a little hard to find, but if you pay attention to the directions,its not hard.
7. We stayed for 2 nights in a room for 4. It was cosy but very comfortable in a newly refurbished room. The bathroom was spacious and well accomodated. Staff were friendly. An adequate breakfast was included. The area is quite but only 2 minutes away from a campo with a patisserie, supermarkets and restaurants. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the hotel in this fantastic city.
8. Just spent the weekend in Venice with my now fiancee and stayed at this hotel. The staff helped me to find a brilliant resturuant (Bistro De Venise), organized flowers and champagne for our room and took care of a gondola booking. They were friendly, attentive and generally amazing. The supreme room I booked was great, the bed super comfortable and the bathrooms very good! The hotel is not that hard to find from the "Riva de Basio" stop on the Grand Canal, at most its a 10 min walk. Staying here made our special weekend away even more special. Highly reccommended!! *Only fault I can think of is my MacBook didn't work with internet in the room, something to do with Bootcamp and their firewall software. But they have a laptop in reception where you can access the internet.
9. Location, location, location is also important for hotels! This hotel offers very spacey rooms ( unlike most in Venice) and is situated only 2 minutes walk from the hussle and bussle of the Rialto part of Venice, but at the same time situated in a very calm and relaxed area. In other words: the nights are quiet, but access to the high life is instant. On top of that, this hotel offers very spacey rooms in the classic Venezian style. Service is superb, good knowleable staff with a wonderful command of the English language. Tremendous service, good solid breakfast, wireless internet and very good coffee. What more does one want? One tip: to reach the hotel from the parking, you can walk or take the waterbus. Don't consider walking!! Take the waterbus. 6 euro p.p but well spent money. This hotel will go onto my shortlist and when I'm in Venice, I will stay here. No question about it.
10. This small, friendly and beautifully appointed hotel proved to be a marvellous base for a relaxing long weekend of fun, great food and hours and hours of incredible sightseeing in the magical city of Venice! Situated almost on the banks of the Grand Canal adjacent to the National History Museum (follow the signs if youever feel lost) this 22 room hotel is really special. The service at the hotel Reception Desk and in the breakfast room is polite, professional, knowlegeable and friendly at all times. The bedrooms are spotlessly clean, spacious and elegantly furnished - even to the extent of having fine glass chandeliers. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
11. Elegant, warm, excellent service - we were more than pleased with this hotel. The rooms were beautiful (we had a cream and gold decorated room), comfortable bed, excellent bath room, breakfast was lovely, internet in room (LAN not wireless, but it was good service). Please note, the hotel is set approximately 20-30 minutes walk from St. Mark's but that was fine with us! It allowed us to 'wander' the walkways and get a real feel for Venice. Walking to the Rialto and the fish market was a delight. Caterina and her staff are most gracious, very helpful with maps and suggestions. It is approximately 20-25 minutes walk from the train station. Note: we brought our GPS and were grateful for it as when we arrived, we promptly were lost! But it brought us directly to the hotel. If you use a GPS, note that you must set it for walking or stop frequently to update your exact position. Also, if you are walking, keep your luggage to a minimum. There are many many bridges with steps that may prove too daunting for some with luggage.
12. spent 3 night there a few days ago. went with a friend for a birthday get away. booked hotel after looking at the reviews and were not disappointed.Slightly off the beaten track but that"s what we liked. As you walk everywhere it really makes no difference anyway and it was quiet and very real venice. 5 mins to station 15 or so to Rialto.Very good bar 1 mins walk away where the locals go and a great trattoria again 1 min. walk with fab. venezian food very well done. I lived in Italy for 20years so I have a pretty good idea. we ate there every night. it"s called La trattoria al ponte. Staff all very helpful all the time and we had tea and coffee in our room - to get us up - for a small charge.Rooms clean comfortable nicely decorated, all new. we were given maps and they helped with directions. I was looking for a paritcular shop and they googled it for me and wrote down the address, all with great friendliness. would tell my friends. Gilly sussex
13. It's not a bad hotel, but there's no way this is the 11th best hotel in Venice (according to TripAdvisor's current rankings). Our room was one of two on the top floor, which sadly the elevator doesn't go to. Being on the top floor also means a slanted roof that can be a tad tight for tall people (especially the shower). There were also no windows in the room -- just two skylights that were obviously installed so they could legally rent out the room at full price. (Note: a skylight might sound nice, but unless you like looking clouds, there isn't much of a view). The complimentary breakfast was nice, too, just be aware that if like your eggs any way but hard-boiled, it's not quite so complimentary anymore. Now, Venice is a small city where everything is within walking distance, therefore every hotel in Venice has a good location, but the location needs to be mentioned nonetheless. It's a quiet neighborhood, which is great during the day if you hate crowds, but at night, the lack of foot traffic was actually a little unsettling, especially on our first couple nights, before we learned our way around. The walk back to the hotel goes through many very dark, very cramped, and very disorientating alleyways. I'm sure Venice is a very safe city, but it's still a city. Next time we're in Venice, we going to try staying somewhere closer to the busy spots. All that said, it's close to the train station, so that was nice. Again, we didn't hate the place, but the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor (and the lofty ranking) definitely boosted our expectations a little too high. Oh, and it should also probably be noted that our room looked nothing like any of the pictures.
14. This room was beautiful. It looked just like the professional photos, was very clean, and had a great bathroom... with a very deep tub. We found it easily enough (follow the instructions on the website!) and the service was very good. The breakfast was AMAZING, especially for italy. I kept expecting them to charge us for it. You have to leave the room key with the front desk when you all leave but really its for the best. Its kind of far from the super touristy sites but nothing is really that far in Venice and it feels nice to be a little more isolated. It is very close to the main entrance to the island so that is very convient. And the neighborhood is good. It was by far the most expensive hotel we stayed at in Italy but we found that everything is more expensive in Venice compared with the rest of Italy.... and when we were looking we found that in Venice you either stay somewhere nice or somewhere bad... not a lot of middle ground. At least with this place you will be happy with what you get for your money.
15. Very convenient to train station, off the beaten path quiet area, room were great, reception staff was very helpful and nice. Location was great for us, about 20 minute walk to San Marco, 10 minutes to Rialto bridge. Overall very nice experience to end honeymoon trip to Italy on.
16. This fantastic little hotel is the perfect place to stay for a romantic getaway that is away from many of the tourist areas. While you might get a little lost trying to find it, but get use to that experience in Venice, it's not difficult to find the hotel. There is a friendly and helpful staff waiting for you. We stayed in a superior golden room on the ground floor and even though it is behind the lobby it is still a quiet stay. The room is large with a typical Italian bed, slightly harder then most but still comfortable, and a large bathroom which is set up for people with special needs. The breakfast was a cold breakfast with plenty of options to eat in morning. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and will definately stay here again on my next visit to Venice.
17. If you want a five star experience in a three star hotel, go there. Fantastic staff, high class materials in classic design, the hotel situated in a calm area away from the busy parts of the city but still in comfortable walking distance to everything.
18. My girlfriend and I had booked this hotel for 2 nights and arrived about Midday. We found the hotel easily following signs for the History Museum. On arrival our room was ready, having booked a Superior room - our expectations were high (judging by reviews and photos!). We were led to a ground floor room which was - literally - next to the reception and lift. The room was customised in traditional Venesian decor, and was spotless. On entering the bathroom it was clear the room is designed for a disabled guest with pull cords, seat in the shower, no bath and adjusted toilet fittings. Despite this we were happy with our room although it was slightly smaller than we imagined. The hotel is situated in a lovely, quaint neighbourhood outside of the busy St Mark's area which is VERY touristy. We spent many an hour wandering the beautiful streets near to the hotel and sitting by the canals. There are several nice restaurants and cafe's nearby to waste the day. Breakfast at the hotel is adequate, although hot food is at an additional charge, so pastries, cereals etc available. Rooms are air conditioned and equipped with free safety deposit box, mini bar, free wifi but no tea or coffee facilities or room in the fridge for water etc. Hotel staff friendly, advised us on main sights and Gondola rides. This hotel is not cheap, but just what we were after. Would definitely visit again.
19. Stayed here for 1 night on a romantic break with my boyfriend, we got upgraded to a superior room which was huge all decked out in red drapes and gold mirrors. Staff very really friendly and helpful and had the best nights sleep in ages. Would definitely recommend this hotel
20. We loved the location and the fact that you can follow the "street" signs to the Museum of Natural History if you prefer walking to water transportation. It's away from the hustle and bustle of tourist areas and especially convenient if you need to be near the train station (about a 10 minute walk). There's a wonderful neighborhood piazza (San Giacomo) just around the corner that gave us easy access to gelato, pastries, sandwiches and restaurants. The hotel itself is lovely and well-maintained with comfortable rooms; breakfast was the standard European variety and well done. Michele and Caterina are extremely helpful and friendly. This was our favorite hotel during our travels by far!
21. This hotel grew on me. It is not luxurious, but it is certainly comfortable, even cozy. It is in a quiet neighborhood but close to water transportation and some lovely restaurants and shops. The woman at the desk during the day was an exceptionally comptetent and courteous person. You can't help but like her. The hotel is safe, clean, reasonable priced and user friendly. I would return and also recommend to others.
22. not the easiest place to fine, even in Venice. If you arrive after dark, you had better have a very good idea of how to find this spot, even if you have been to Venice. Rooms very small, prices are fair and you do get breakfast. I dont think I would stay there again. Staff was very helpfull however. Not a bad experience, just too many choices in the world today and would go somewhere else. Location is very centralized however.
23. Stayed 2 nights after getting off a cruise in Venice. Charming hotel that has only been open a year with 14 rooms. Our room was very large with a lovely bathroom. WIFI and continental breakfast was included. Michelle at the front desk always had a smile on her face and was very helpful with directions and our luggage when we arrived. Although we arrived early and our room was not yet ready, we were able to leave our luggage and go off touring. Handy location for the water bus stop and close to a local square that had a grocery store and several restaurants.
24. This hotel should be 5 star. It made our trip all the more special... The decor and cleanliness of the room was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly. They couldnt do enough for you.. The breakfast was very nice, even though there wasn't a huge selection, there was enough choice to suit everyone. I would definatly recommend this hotel, and if I were to go back to venice would definatly stay here. Added extras were that they provided you with a detailed map on your arrival, pointing out all the must see places, recommended resturants (although we didn't try them) and there is free internet access in the hotel with a pass code they provide you with at reception.
25. This was a lovely hotel in an excellent location - a quiet little road, but walkable to the train station and all the sights of Venice. It is only a 3-star hotel, but possible the nicest 3-star hotel we've ever stayed in. Very large room, decorated in a wonderfully over-the-top, Italian style. Breakfast is adequate - fruit, cereal, bread, ham/cheese, basic cake/pastries. There are hot options available for an extra charge. Efficient, friendly service from the front desk. This hotel was good value, when you consider that Venice is an expensive city.
26. As others have said - lovely little hotel, gorgeous, comfortable rooms. Breakfast small but adequate. Conveniently located in Santa Croce, which is close to the train station while still being fairly close to San Marco/Rialto without too much hustle-and-bustle. Warnings: owner/manager, though nice, does try to steer you in a much more expensive direction than you might be expecting, recommending very expensive/touristy restaurant in San Marco (which, once I actually checked the place out, did not seem to be as good as the more local/authentic restaurants nearby in Santa Croce), also trying to sell little ceramic things to us from the hotel lobby (at inflated prices). So all in all, as long as you graciously decline all the recommendations and go with Tripadvisor or just your gut by walking around, you'll love this place. It's gorgeous, it's a good value, and well-located.
27. This medium sized hotel, a former Dukes Palace or Merchant house, is just behind the Natural History Museum in Venice, about two stops along the grand canal form the railway station. It is close to a little square where local families and tourists both eat and mingle in the evening, which was something I didn't expect to see in Venice, and very much added to the character of our visit. The hotel was spotless, recently refurbished with limestone scrolled details retained within the pristine modern bathroom, and the decor in the room was opulent with silks, venetian glass, and chenilles everywhere - which didn't seem contrived at all given the setting. The breakfast room was small, and the choice at breakfast was limited, but otherwise, this hotel was perfect.
28. We spent the 1st 3 nights of our Italian honeymoon here and had a fantastic time. Slightly difficult to find as you have to navigate down a couple of narrow lanes before it opens up to a wider street. Not far from San Stae vaporetto stop.We arrived at night too, so was much easier to locate in the daylight! Welcoming reception staff who showed us our room which was right behind reception. A fairly big room by Venice standard and beautifully decorated. Great big bathroom although i think our room catered for disabled visitors with more of a wet room shower and disabled toilet facilities. Our room was right at the front entrance to the hotel, and even though it was off season, the location of the hotel on a quiet street gave a great undisturbed sleep. the breakfast facilities were good with friendly helpful staff offering fresh made cappuccinos. After hours of sightseeing, it was great to head back to the hotel, and continue to the end of the street, where we would sit on the Grand Canal and watch the continual buzz of Venice life. loved it, and would definately return.
29. Hotel is ok for the price. It's a place to sleep and have some breakfast. Location is ok. 10-15 min walk from piazzale roma if you don't get lost. Whereever you go in venice you will get lost. Take vaporetto to Riva del Biasio or the next stop. Once you have the hotel's map, it makes things easier. Our room was small. We had a window. The bathroom had a shower in the corner with a curtain. No tub. Breakfast was ok. Nothing special in my opinion. The hotel is about 10 min walk to Rialto market. About double or so to San Marco. The traghetto across to the Ghetto area was never operating so don't rely on it on your map. Overall, we loved Venice but not because of the hotel.
30. We arrived in Venice and reached the hotel (through flooded street) safely. The hotel was not big from its external appearance but fantastic once we were inside: warm welcome by hotel staff, great room arrangement, spontaneous tour guide and above all the surrounding was so quiet! We were allocated rooms at the top level. There were only TWO rooms there. And they were superb! The hotel is far better than what we perceived on the photos, and deserve to be promoted better. It is not close from the hotspots for tourists. But being a small city, it took us less than 30 minutes to reach Piazza San Marco. And along the way, there were so many small boutiques which were so unique to Venice, so no time lost. All in all, please book your next stay in Venice with this hotel.
31. One of the highlights of our trip to Italy was the Al Duca Hotel and their staff...all were very pleasent and so helpful with any request we had, especially the breakfast staff. I would highly recommand this hotel when visiting Venice, even if it is hard to find....
32. We had a great stay at this lovely little hotel. It's only small but it's full of charm and character and very easy to find being the first stop off the water taxi - directly out of the train station. We were greeted by very friendly staff and offered a glass of Prosecco before being shown to our room which was a very nice touch. Our room was one of the "red" ones and had a comfy bed and our only disappointment was that it didn't have a bath but because there was so much to do in a short time this wasn't a huge problem as showering was quicker! The walk into the main area of Venice was very pleasant and we took a different route in and back each time, never finding the same alleyways and lots of photo opportunites. I fell in love with Venice and want to go back and would stay at the same hotel as it was nice to have the walk in and out each day which only took 15 minutes to get to St Marks Square, if that. Yes, Venice is expensive but there are places to eat that are off the beaten track that are well worth the visit as we found the food in the main areas to be expensive and just not worth the money - drinks in St Marks Square are very expensive so avoid at all costs - it's just not worth it as you can soak up the atmosphere just as nicely by sitting on the side and taking it all in and then find yourself a place to eat that will be worth the money a little away from the main hubbub!
33. Lovely quaint hotel in a peaceful part of city next to Venetian Museum of Natural History (Museo di Storia Naturale). 15 mins walk from Ferrovia (railway station). Recommend taking Vaporetta (water bus) Route 1 to Riva de Biasio stop for those with luggage in tow. Warmly received by exceptionally friendly reception staff who spoke good english, armed with ready smile to greet render assistance on directions, food, places of visits etc. Room was clean, beautifully decorated Venezian style. Exceededed expectations for 3* hotel. Has free wi-fi, in-room safe and delicious continental breakfast (variety of food not great but sufficient). Airconditioning worked flawlessly - a good respite from scorching summer heat. Location is not near major Venice attractions but reachable via Vaporetta or walking as Venice is a relatively small city.
34. My husband and I stayed here for the first stop of our Italian Honeymoon. We had the "Red Room" which was very authentic and romantic. Great location, great room, great service...great choice! The breakfast was yummy and included fresh cappuccino. The hotel recommended 2 restaurants: Ca'Leon which we LOVED and Bistrot de Venise which was good but a bit over priced. All in all a wonderful hotel and a perfect trip to Venice.
35. Though we got off to a little bit of a rocky start (our VISA credit card did not work abroad for some reason, & they tried contacting us several times, but gmail automatically put all of their emails into a spam folder - didn't even know it existed! ), we ended up having a great stay here in Venice. We loved the location & the manager there was wonderful. Also, the breakfast was top notch, I definitely had the best cappuccino of our stay at this hotel. And the dramatic, incredibly romantic rooms couldn't have been beat for the first nights of our honeymoon. There is no view of the canal, true, but we didn't miss it - you're on or next to the water all day. Even the water taxi is beautiful & thrilling. One of the people at the desk wasn't particularly friendly, he seemed annoyed to help my husband with his phone, but otherwise everyone was very friendly! Oh, and it was great having a computer free to use in the lobby. Thank you!
36. Due to our own stupid mistake, we showed up at this hotel one day before our reservation. The staff were so accomodating. They put us into a spare room (which was amazing) and took great care of us. This hotel is in a great location. It is not right on top of the main tourist haunts so it gives you a chance to explore different lane ways every time you venture out. The breakfasts were great and staff were always on hand to help. We opted to book a room with an external bathroom. This unfortunatley was actually up on another level and through a canvas covered walkway on the roof - which was not the greatest seeing as it was winter, but all in all, we would go back to Al Duca di Venezia if we have the good fortune to return to Venice.
37. We chose this hotel based on the reviews of other guests. We were not disappointed! The hotel is easy to find if you take the directions given on the hotel website. The hotel is situated in a very quiet part of the town which becomes a very welcome change from the crowds in the other parts of Venice. It is about 15 minutes walk to the Rialto Bridge and another 10 minutes onto St Marks Square. We were given a Superior room at the front of the hotel which was tastefully decorated in cream and gold and made to resemble a vintage style. The breakfast was adequate but became a bit monotonous after a couple of days. The service was great and the reception staff were very willing to give recommendations for sight seeing and where to eat. Eating by the major sights in Venice can prove to be very expensive. We found some great restaurants by the hotel which served great food and had a more local atmosphere. We would recommend La Zucca ( you have to book beforehand for both evening meal and lunch) and Capitan Uncino. Both are very close to the Hotel. We would definitely recommend staying here and can't wait to go back!
38. Just returned from our italian journey celebrating our 10 yr anniversary. Had the pleasure of staying six nights - three nights to begin our trip and three nights to end. The overall hotel experience was outstanding. Despite getting one of the smaller superior rooms upon arrival we were surprised with a beautiful and spacious superior room when we returned, although we reserved a classic room. The hotel is beautifully restored palace. The renovations and finishes are top of the line. The staff was kind, helpful and accomodating (this is not a given when travelling in Italy). The breakfast was typical, but we really enjoyed the freshly baked brioche. This was our third trip to Venice. When we return we will be staying at this hotel. There is no better value in Venice!
39. Good location in the quieter, residential part of Venice. Follow the directions on the website and you can't go wrong. Very appealing reception and very helpful staff on reception. Be prepared for a detailed explanation on why you will have to pay 3 Euros per person, per night and why it has to be paid in cash only. Very interesting! The room we had was a superior on the first floor opposite the gorgeous red rooms. It was beautifully decorated in the Venetian style. There was a safe and TV. En suite was excellent with a selection of toiletries. The bed was divine. Very comfortable. All in all, very good. Breakfasts are very good with good coffee made to order, fresh pastries, cake, biscotti etc. La Duca is an excellent base for exploring Venice and the hotel provides maps and will help you with directions and general help. I needed a pharmacy and the directions given to me helped me find it very quickly when otherwise it might have taken me ages. There are some excellent places to eat nearby and if you look around, some of them are fairly reasonably priced. If you can speak any Italian, it will go a long way with the Venetians. They appreciate you trying. They are very friendly and love a laugh and joke. If you've never been to Venice and are thinking about going. What are you waiting for? Go! Stay at this hotel and you can't go wrong. It's away from the crazy tourist hustle and bustle and you'll be glad of the peace and quiet after a day of sightseeing. If there was a minus point, it was that there was no room service (and if there was, we were not made aware of it) and no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. I know that this is the norm in Italy but it makes this hotel a good Bed and Breakfast when it is just a step away from being a wonderful hotel.
40. This is a small, lovely, cozy hotel opened in March 2010. The staff, lead by Caterina - the hotel manager - is very pleasant and competent. Reservations were easy to be done through email, Carlo and Pratik answered all the infos we needed. We travelled with our teen age son and stayed in room 101. The hotel has an elevator for carrying up the lugage. The room was spacious, very nice decorated in Venezian style, exactly as shown in the hotel website. Nice and clean bathroom. From our room we could see the street and the Museum of Natural History The location was close to all the main tourist attractions in a nice and peaceful neighborhood. Our rate included continental breakfast which was delicious. Wireless internet was included in the rate and worked with no problems. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would certainly stay there again on our next visit
41. I could not have been more pleased with Hotel Al Duca. The hotel is small, and located about 100 feet from the Grand Canal, and is easily reached from the airport ( I splurged with a private water taxi ). As my luggage did not arrive, I cannot say enough good things about the staff. Michelle, at the front desk, was incredible! She helped me to try and track down my bag, and as we worked two phones for 2 hours, she was professional and very sweet! The hotel was clean and had a nice breakfast.....my room had a deep and fab bathtub....but the location was just FANTASTIC! I easily walked to the Rialto Market and then to San Marco Piazza.....but I stayed in the lovely square just a two minute walk from the hotel in the evenings. There was a cafe with wines, a wonderful restaurant with delicious pizza, and the best people watching. The square was full of families in the early evening, children running off energy, moms watching, older people strolling arm in arm. There is also a "supermarket" in the square, perfect for nibbles and a bottle of wine....Do NOT miss the little bakery you will pass on your walk from the hotel, it's on the left right before the square......the most delicious "Italian" style cannoli!
42. We arrived in Venice by train, a bit hard to maneuver our suitcases over the cobbled paths, up the stairs and over the bridge... But when we arrived 10 mins later at Al Duca di Venezia it was WELL worth the walk! We got to the hotel and found out we were upgraded! The room was absolutely beautiful. The best hotel we stayed in while we traveled around Italy. The staff were super friendly and helpful! They gave us advice about food, shopping and sight seeing - with a very handy map included! Would recommend this place to absolutely everyone!!!! !
43. Hotel Al Duca is a wonderful small bed and breakfast located in a very quiet neighborhood in the Santa Croce district. The hotel is well appointed and the rooms although small are beautifully decorated with lavishly colored wallpaper, draperies and bedspreads. The Murano glass chandelier in our room was a true work of art. Continental breakfast was served every morning with warm croissants, bagels, a selection of cold cut meats and cheese, fresh fruit and juices.Just a short walk to nearby vaporetto stops makes getting aroud Venice a breeze. The staff was attentive and very helpful with suggestions for sightseeing and recommended restaurants nearby. Overall a very good value for the moderate room rate.
44. My wife and I stayed 3 nights in October 2011 for our honeymoon and were amazed by the beauty of the rooms. The hotel is located within a 5 minute walking distance from the Vaporetto and you can make the trip to from the car parking / bus stations within 15. When we arrived, we found out that our room had a water plumbing problem so we had to stay in a temporary B&B apartment nearby. While we were a bit disappointed (especially since it was our honeymoon) we were not notified earlier of the situation, Catherine (the general manager) made the right amends the next day by upgrading our room for the last two nights and forgoing payment on the first night. It was a very nice gesture that really makes you feel like the staff cares about its guests. The rooms themselves are as beautiful as they look in the photographs. For any honeymooners, the red rooms were absolutely romantic and the way to go. Overall, great location, friendly and caring staff, and beautiful rooms.
45. Everything about this hotel was brilliant. I loved this hotel. It's the perfect place for a romantic getaway. The room, esp. the red superior room was stupendous. I will go back there for sure. P.S - If you're loaded, then go by the hotel staff's recommendations for places to eat, visit, etc. If you're not, then do your own homework cause their recommendations all but drove me to poverty :)
46. My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in October 2011. We arrived by train around noon, and it only took us about 12 or so minutes to walk to the hotel from the station carrying all of our bags. The directions they gave were easy to follow, however I imagine that it could be difficult to find for the first time in the evening. Our room was the only room without an in-room bathroom - when booking this was not a problem for us. We were surprised by how large this room actually was. You have to take the steps to go to the private bathroom, which again was no problem and made clear when booking. However, you technically have to go outside on the roof to get to the bathroom. This was a little unexpected. They have some white tarps arranged in a way to make a hallway, but there is no mistaking that you are on a roof. Also, there is no external lock on the bathroom to guarantee that no one wanders in. You can lock the bathroom once you are inside, but for me, this seems like a security issue. Not to mention, since we were told that the room was private we left a few bathroom items in there (face wash, loofah and conditioner) - only to find out that they had been thrown away. Luckily this was at the end of our trip, or it would have been a little more of an issue. Other than this, the bathroom itself was very nice. The hotel staff was friendly and their breakfast was great. If it wasn't for the minor bathroom issue (throwing away our stuff) and the safety concerns, I would have given the hotel a 5 rating.
47. Me and my wife stayed in Al Duca di Venezia for 5 nights. We had a superior double room. Hotel is located in a quite place, but short walking distance from Rialto anf from Piazzale Roma. Room was great. A big room (much bigger than what you typically get in euroean hotels), very nicely decorated, and very nice bathroom. Everything is new and looks very nice and clean. Breakfast was typical (you can order any type of eggs for extra cost). Hotel manager (I think that her name is Caterina) was so nice and helpfull. She gave us very good advices, and was very very friendly. We will come again
48. My Mother and I had an amazing time!! The service was very good!! The manager, Catherina was very nice and helpful. We stayed in a room with external bathroom but it was not a problem at all!! We strong recommend Al Duca Di Venezia hotel for you next trip to Venice! !
49. I had booked 2 nights at this hotel via booking.com, however could not make it to Venice on time due to Italian transportation strike, I informed booking.com about my predicament and rightfuly so changed my booking to only 1 night. As a courtesy I informed the hotel about the change and was told insistingly that I will have to pay the full 2 nights which I believe was unfair so I cancelled my booking altogether via booking.com. I was quite distraught to find out when I was back that the hotel charged me full 2 nights despite me not even having spent 1 night at the hotel.
50. We stayed in the Al Duca Hotel for four nights, and really enjoyed our stay. Location: Although not located in the touristy centre (more relaxed and quiet! ), Venice is very small and you can walk from the hotel to all the hotspots in about 10 minutes. Rooms: The hotel is expectionally well build and decorated - I have seldomly seen such eye for detail. The rooms are really 'Venetian styled' (the cheaper ones are a bit small though, but that is inherent to Venice I guess). Service: the people at reception are really very kind and truly genuine. All in all, I can really recommend this place.
51. We stayed here for three nights in July and really enjoyed our stay. The rooms are alot smaller then I thought, but beautifully decorated and well looked after. The bed was a little hard for my liking but still managed to sleep ok after a long day in Venice. Breakfast was sufficient but the simply addition of a toaster would help, I don't drink coffee but it did look really good!. In room facilities are great like the free safe, Wifi and hair dryer all good touches. Location is fantastic, not to far from the attractions and easy enough to find from the airport. Staff are very friendly and helpful and the price we paid was pretty good for the standard and location of the hotel. We would recommend and return to this hotel if we returned to Venice.
52. We were disappointed in Venice overall and rejoiced that vicissitudes reduced our visit from two days to one--it's smelly, congested, and overpriced, and most of the shops sell Carnival kitsch and other such merchandise. The Casino is pretty vulgar. But this hotel stands out for us as the best part of our visit--secluded, very friendly, over-the-top decor, nice breakfast, plenty of advice and assistance (especially from Caterina and her son). And we remain grateful for such an oasis in a desert of taste.
53. We stayed at Al Duca the beginning of November 2011. It is the best 3 star hotel we've stayed at in Venice. Our Superior room was 102 and it is a very, very red room (photos are on their website), large for European standards, high ceilings, with a step up to the beige/tan marble bathroom. The bed was a little hard for me but my husband loved it. Our child slept on a roll-away that they loved because it was so comfortable. Bathroom was very clean. Free use of lobby computer with free printing of boarding passes was a wonderful addition. The lift/elevator is very small. This hotel is in a quiet section (San Crose) away from the chaos of Pizza San Marco (St. Mark's Square). .It is located about a 15 minute stroll including about 6 small bridges from Rialto bridge The hotel is tricky to find, especially at midnight, so if you have GPS bring it and use it. The Hotel is between the San Biascio and S. Stae vaporetto stops and really does back up to the Natural History Museum.Bring a detailed map and folowwing the signs on the sides of the walls and sometimes on the pavement can direct in what direction you need to go, Station = toward P. Roma, or Rialto = toward the bridge and tourist town The church at the S.Stae vaporetto stop is impressive. Typical continental breakfast but the coffee and hot chocolate were wonderful. No pan au chocolat for the kid but the multigrain/nut roll with sunflower seeds is good (usually found with pistachio) and cooked eggs are offered for extra. There is some noise, not too bad, in the mornings from people going up and down the stairs to the breakfast areas.
54. We stayed at this hotel having booked two superior rooms. It is quite close to the Piazzza Roma and railway station. We found our way easily to the hotel having got instructions from their web site and checked on Google maps. The area of the hotel is fairly quiet and has a local feel. If is not far to walk to the main atractions (Venice is a small place which can easily be covered on foot by anyone of reasonable fitness). The hotel is smart and clean and the bedrooms exceptionally nice. The public areas are small but adiquate. The staff were very friendly and helpful, going out of their way to try to make the best of our stay. Breakfast was a good continental with planty of choice. Cooked food was extra but not really required so we didn't bother with that. On the down side a garden or terrace would be nice to site out in, but we knew they didn't have one when we booked so weren't didapointed. Hotels with these facilities appear to be very expensive in Venice as open space is at a premium in this city. The hotel was expensive however everything in Venice appears expensive so don't be put off by the price. Overall this was a very nice hotel with very good room standards. Location we found excellent, allowing us easy access to the busier parts of the city but a quiet retreat at night and in the evening.
55. The hotel was a bit hard to find on foot after the boat from the airport dropped us off at the vaporetti stop of San Stae. However, when we finally found the hotel, it turned out to be within an easy 5 minute walk of the vaporetti stop. It has large, clean, extravagantly decorated rooms. The people at the front desk were helpful but beware of being steered by them to overpriced tourist restaurants. Breakfast is adequate but is served in stuffy rooms. The location near two vaporetti stops makes it easy to access many of the major attractions.
56. We absolutely were pleased with our room. We had the Classic Room. (Gold) Bathroom- The cleanest, spacious, with stand up shower, fan and nice window and hair dryer was a plus. Bedroom- LOVED LOVED LOVED the bed! I booked this room because of their beds and cleanliness. I don't stay in hotels with hard smelly beds.. This bed was so comfortable that we had the best sleep EVER! Loved the decor and colors- i took pictures of the bed, i loved the headboard!!! Nice big windows- air the room out!! Overall the room- Smelled good, clean, enough room for two, comfortable clean beds, free WIFI with code at front desk- has anything you need! Free breakfast! Proximity to Rialto, Train- We WALKED everywhere!! It is close to everything. About 5 minutes from the Rialto Bridge. It is very close to the train but we had to take a water taxi to our hotel. That was the only time we took public transportation. Breakfast- European breakfast. We had a few pastries and cappuccino. We ate cereal and fruit. Save the calories for dinner! !
57. We found the hotel easily after getting off the water taxi, it was very lovely. Very clean, very helpful staff and I would definately stay there again. The only thing that would have made it better was if it was slightly cheaper, but you get what you pay for. Great hotel would absolutely recommend this one if you can afford it.
58. This hotel is a delight--absolutely gorgeous. My room was shades of cream and gold. Rich but not overpowering. It was a good size with a large bed and a large closet. I looked out on a little courtyard. The bathroom was marble with a bidet and heated rails for the towels which were in the same colors as the rest of the room. Everything was immaculate and in excellent condition. Breakfast was fine and the service was impeccable.The staff went out of their way to make my stay enjoyable and it really was an outstanding experience. Molto bene!
59. We made our reservation 6 months in advance, based on the TA reviews, and are glad we did. The hotel is new/newly renovated, with beautiful decor, marble bathrooms, elegant linens and Venetian chandeliers in all of the rooms. The location was excellent for us - near a vaporetto stop and the train station, in a quiet area of Santa Croce not too near the San Marco tourist mayhem. The hotel staff accommodated without a fuss a special request we made (our daughters weren't comfortable sleeping in the same king size bed, so the hotel re-made the bed as two single beds). We arrived at the hotel before check-in time, but they held our bags and had moved them to our room by the time we returned from a walk in Venice. The free wifi worked great in our 2nd floor (European 1st floor) room. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking an elegant stay and attentive service in Venice.
60. We stayed in Venice in early September, for the first time, as part of our Silver Wedding Anniversary holiday. The hotel is in a perfect location, just two stops on the water bus, then a short walk. All the staff at the hotel made us very welcome, the service was exceptional. We stayed in a "red room", overlooking the museum at the side, and it was very luxurious, comfortable and very quiet. Breakfast was very good. For us, the location was the key, as it is away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy St Marks etc. but close-by is a lovely square with some excellent restaurants, supermarket, etc. Everywhere is very accessible from the hotel, we walked everywhere, you can walk very easily to the busy tourist places if you want to but then have the lovely option to go back to the quieter area of the Al Duca. A memorable place to stay in Venice.
61. I canâ€™t fault anything about this hotel â€“ the staff are friendly and helpful; the room (101) is dramatically decorated, clean, comfortable and very quiet, with a nice view of the museum next door; the breakfast is fine and plentiful; and the location is great if you donâ€™t want to be in the middle of all the hub-bub but do want easy access to everywhere. Itâ€™s about 30 seconds from San Stae vaporetto stop, just straight up the road, which is handy for the airport (we got one of those semi-private water taxi thingys, not sure what they call them but it dropped us right at San Stae stop) and for everywhere else. About one minuteâ€™s walk away is a nice little square with a few restaurants and bars on it where you can watch the locals go about their daily lives. If you donâ€™t want to use the vaporetto itâ€™s also easy to walk everywhere else â€“ and even if a particular area is a little bit far away, thereâ€™s plenty to take â€˜photos of along the way, so itâ€™s not a hassle! ï�Š I would definitely stay here again. I am just so happy to find a hotel where there is nothing to disappoint! ï�Š
62. My husband and I have just been to this most beautiful little hidden treasure of a hotel for the 3rd time in 13 months. We`ve celebrated a wedding anniversary and my birthday there...its just that sort of stunning secret place you want to go to when you`ve got something (anything) to celebrate. The staff are always extremely friendly, and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms, well the one room we`ve stayed in each time (201), and others we`ve poked our head into when the doors have been ajar, are so sumptuous and nicely spacious. Everything is spotlessly clean..someone mentioned rusty mirrors...thats the antique finish effect sweetie !!! The only thing we find lets it down just a very small tad is that the breakfast isn`t particularly inspiring, or much of a choice. This just means you get to stop off for a little extra something on the walk thru the mesmerising little alleyways into town !!! I`m actually quite sad we`ve got other things planned for the next year, and won`t be going back there for a while. Many thanks to Caterina and all her staff.
63. my girlfriend and i are here on our last night unfortunately. We love this hotel. Room 101 is beautiful. Has a view of the musuem and is really quiet. Staff are friendly and the breakfast was delicious if you like the typical European breakfast. This hotel is an awesome value. It's a few hundred feet from the grand canal. I would honestly not need to spend the extra money for a hotel that faces it anyways. We'll definitely be staying here again. Ciao David P
64. We booked here for a hotel in the heart of Venetian Venice after finding it on Google Earth. An inspired choice - wonderfully modernised and refurbished old building, very accessible from the waterbuses (an essential for getting around in Venice, and one of the nearby stops is on the express airport run) and only a miunute away from oustanding local restaurants with excellent quality and prices. The rooms are superb - we had luxury in red with fabric coated walls and a very comfortable bed. Good breakfast, and the staff could not be friendlier or more welcoming. This will certainly be a hotel we will revisit.
65. Not only was our room beautiful and spacious. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They were willing to book tours, dinner, and attractions for us and did a lovely job. The location was a bit hard to find lugging our suitcases through the winding streets, and the gondola crossing closest to the hotel seemed to be closed. However, once we made it there, we appreciated the location away from the heavy tourist traffic and there was a small market near by. The decor of the hotel was quite lovely, and included many murano glass chandeliers and sconces.
66. Venice is certainly not an easy city to deal with -- but this hotel goes out of its way to alleviate some of the challenges. Our room was charming and spacious; the bathroom was a bit small -- but convenient. Breakfast was ample and good! The staff -- although a bit harried -- took time to deal with individual traveller concerns. (The hotel had a lot of guests!) The location -- beside the Natural History museum -- is a short walk from a dock at the end of the street. A taxi from the station is 40 euros -- and, therefore, getting to the hotel is relatively easy. The San Toma vaporetto station is not the far away either -- and taking the vaporetto is much easier than navigating through Venice's complicated streets -- just walk "inland" from the vaporetto station nearest to where you are going. The hotel arranged to have a boat meet us at the dock at the end of the street for a transfer to the airport; so I can say that this hotel has service down to a science!
67. My husband and I stayed for two nights over New Years Eve and had chosen the hotel due to the excellent reviews here. The place was very clean and well appointed, lovely decor in our tiny standard room (the bathroom was huge and very nice). But the service really let it down. When we arrived (early) they were too busy to check us in properly so we were told to leave our bags in the (unsecured) dining room and come back later). No map, no guidance, no attention. Then when we did come back our bags were still downstairs, forgotten about. By this time there was one staff member, a man, who made smarty-pants remarks to everything we said. He was helpful enough, but only after making smarmy comments. When we enquired about wi-fi my husband was told it was only reliable in the small lobby and he was left waiting for half an hour for a password (she'd said to wait and then forgotten that he was over on the couch in plain view, waiting). The bed was very hard (but better than some we'd stayed in like th el cheapo backpackers in Naples). Mr Smarmy did deliver some excellent help at this stage and found me a cot mattress to pad the bed with. The room was very dark with the blinds closed, so much so that we overslept and didn't realise that it was morning when it was (set your alarms). For how the hotel looked and its rating, the breakfast was surprisingly supermarket-ish. Not particularly enticing at all - just supermarket pre-packaged baked goods. Then to top it off as we checked out we watched in amazement as a couple checking in were given a map and detailed directions for getting around and all their service came with a smile and no smarm from Mr Smarmy.
68. The hotel is lovely, the rooms beautifully decorated, spacious and very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location was great for us, as it was quiet, but at the same time an easy walk to St Mark's Sq, or the Vaporetto, and there are a couple of nice restaurants in the area (avoid Captains Cabin though!). The only negative aspect of our stay was that on arrival we were told that there had been a "problem with the system" and that despite booking in May, we would be in a downstairs room next to reception for the first two nights, then move to a better room for the last two nights. We were assured that the room downstairs was a superior double, but having been moved upstairs to Room 104, I'm pretty sure Room 01 is a classic double. It was a shame to put a dampener on what was a lovely trip.
69. We love the people at this hotel . we came to venice at the tail end of a trip to italy to indulge in the romance of the city . unfortunately we made 2 huge mistakes upon arriving . first to avoid the high cost of water taxis we attempted to walk from the parking area to the hotel . this was a huge mistake as we got lost ,and had to navigate steps and bridges with our bags. when we finally made it to the hotel which was very hard to find ,we could not find our wallets or passports . the desk clerk was very sweet and allowed us to go to our room and collect our thoughts . we found our stuff back in the car , and finally checked in officially 4 hours later . the hotel was a great value, very clean ,very comfortable, and staff couldn't have been nicer. so even though venice was a huge disappointment , dirty expensive and unfriendly , the hotel was exactly opposite. we would recommend this hotel as long as you don't mind being out of the area where all of the major attractions are . it is quiet and lovely .
70. Great hotel central to everything but in a quiet area, staff were fantastic and Caterina welcomed us with open arms. Very clean and spacious rooms. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. My sisters and I will definitely be back. 5 star hotel for sure. Thanks Caterina
71. My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. We reached Venice train station late in the night and decided to walk to the hotel. But even with a very detailed map, we had some trouble finding the location. The guy at the reception was pretty friendly and suggested many must-see places in the area and even took the pains to mark them on the map. The room was nice (even had a small provision for skylight). It is also equipped with all required amenities. Internet is also available in the room. The breakfast was very basic but filling. One has to walk some distance to get to the main centres. But overall, i give a thumbs-up!
72. Lovely, quiet hotel in (slightly) less touristy area of the city. Front desk was accommodating at all times. Breakfast was very good and generous. Despite the fact we were on a ground floor room, I slept like a baby and felt very secure. For older travellers getting to other parts of the city may be a bit arduous; we were fine with taking the public boats, for which we bought a three day pass, very much needed. All in all, a positive experience in a city overrun by tourists.
73. We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Al Duca and it's an easy call to give it a rating of 5. Our triple room was perfect, with a very roomy bathroom (which we have found rare in Europe). The room itself was very spacious. It's somewhat hard to find in the maze of Venetian streets, but it's a short walk and only a few steps on one bridge from the Riva Biasio vaporetto stop. The adventure of finding it and navigating the "streets" is part of the fun. The hotel staff was very helpful, the breakfast was fine (but why wouldn't you wander the streets sampling the other foods available?) and the bed was comfortable. The A/C worked very well, and the windows with shutters added to the charm. We'd go back in a heartbeat.
74. We were only in Venice to acclimate (flew from Seattle) as our ultimate destiny was Dubrovnik, but we ended up staying three nights to see if our luggage would show up. The staff at Al Duca was very accommodating; they had to move us one night since our initial reservation was one night and we were upgraded for the same price. The hotel itself was lovely, the rooms were a nice size, the shower pressure was great, the heat was respondent, the breakfast was tasty, the hotel was quiet. All in all, a nice experience and aside from the missing luggage, a perfect kick-off to a wonderful vacation.
75. My two friends and I stayed for only one night.....we had previously stayed in Venice for seven nights at a different hotel and were now on our way home after visiting the Veneto. The location of Al Duca di Venezia is excellent if you are leaving Venice as it is only one stop on the vaporatto after the train station and two beyond the Tronchetto parking lot. It is easily walkable from either but be mindful that if walking from the train you must cross over a large bridge with many stairs. When we arrived we were greeted by a woman who was just mildly pleasant. She seemed only to have pat answers for sightseeing questions I had and I left the desk feeling like I knew more about the area than she did. The room to which we were assigned was the red room....truly a lovely room, but only if there are two people sharing it. The extra bed, and I am being generous here, was just a small cot with an extremely thin mattress. It was suitable for a small child under 10. We three have been traveling for years and never have we been given an extra bed of this quality. I would have very much appreciated it if they said they were not equipped to handle three adults in one room and we would have booked elsewhere.
76. Venice is such a beautiful and wondrous location to begin with and then staying here was just a finishing touch to the start of our holiday. From the Vaporetto stop you only have to cross one bridge in the 5 min walk. The red room with high ceilings were better than the website shows. Katherine at the front desk during the day was so friendly and helpful. I just loved the kitschy look of the lobby and the breakfast was plenty to tide us over until way past noon. Great quiet neighborhood away from the tourist locations and actually near a square where the local children play after school. Will stay here again when we return.
77. We had difficulty finding the hotel walking from the train station. The brochure shows the hotel as being situated "on the canal" when in actuality it is located a little further down from the canal. Once we were checked in, we found our room to be very nice,clean and the staff were eager to accomodate. I liked the location and like everywhere in Venice, well within walking distance to the Rialto bridge and San Marco square. Despite that the hotel is on the pricey side, I would recommend it to friends.
78. The hotel is well situated for frequent trains into Venice which are priced at just 1.80euro each way per person. The room we had was plenty large enough, had air conditioning, (a must in summer months), and was generally very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent and the staff extremely friendly. Having been told how expensive Venice is, I thought at first that the rate quoted for 4 nights was the night rate and was very pleasantly surprised to find it was the rate for bed and breakfast for the 4 nights. Excellent value for money, I would recommend this hotel. BUT, ask for one of the quiet rooms on the side of the hotel. The rooms adjacent to the Square to the front of the hotel are affected by noise from the bar in the same Square.
79. This hotel is on the north side of the island and right off the main canal. It is directly behind the Museum of Natural History. The water taxi dropped us off from the airport and it was less than 1/2 a block to the front door. We took the Red Family room that is pictured on their site and it was really lovely. Our girls (11 and 14) thought it was magical. The bathroom is newly renovated and very clean and functional. The hotel is very quiet and it is easy to get where you want to go either by Vaparetto or walking. Breakfast included freshly baked pastries that hit you by nose before you are fully awake......YUM! Good service, helpful staff and free internet. Loved our stay here and loved Venice!
80. We spent 4 nights in this hotels. we arrived from Milan on 7Nov, a lousy day :the water bus was on strike and raining heavily, St Marco was flooded. We walk about 10 min following the instruction on the web, up and down the bridge with 3 pieces of luggages in the rain. and it was easily located and the reception was warm and friendly. We have booked a superior room and was given a superior room just behind the reception on ground floor, what a relief. though it may look a bit different from the picture. But it is spacious and well equipped. we even do our laundry everyday and clothing were dry the next morning because of the heater in the bathroom. Though this is a small hotel, but easily access to all places, and away from the bustle and hustle and the crowd. Staff were very friendly and helpful to show us the direction to places of interest and restaurants. Overall, great hotel and service.
81. The hotel was beautiful, just like the pictures. The service was fantastic. The family room was perfect and accommodated a family consisting of 2 adults and 2 young adults. We fell in love with Venice and cannot wait to return. The city did not smell during our visit and was cleaner than Rome or Florence.
82. The hotel is located in a very quiet part of Venice, about a 15-minute walk from the train station and a 15 to 20 minute walk to Plaza San Marco. We were given a room on the ground floor behind the reception desk. The room had a small window facing the street, and being at ground level, the view was not very good. You may want to inquire if this is the only standard room available. The people working at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Upon check-in, the person at the reception desk gave us a map and really took the time to instruct us on the location of the hotel, how to get to various sites of interest, and how to take the water bus. This guy deserves a pay raise. I can confirm the reviews on this website about the quality of the rooms. Our room was clean and richly decorated. The bathroom is large and for the price, I was pleasantly surprised to find free disposable bath products, unlike other hotels in Europe. The shiny marble tiles add to the aesthetic appeal. For a wonderful stay in lovely Venice, book your room at this cozy hotel now.
83. Hotel is modern and well appointed with free wi-fi and computer (great for downloading photos from camera memory card to our external hard drive). Iâ€™d say the hotel is more 4 stars than 3. DELUXE FAMILY ROOM - Very large modern and luxurious bathroom, massive bedroom with couch and small writing table. Beautiful dÃ©cor. BREAKFAST â€“ Very generous choices and all tasted great - cold meats, cheeses, cereals, different pastries/sweets, yogurt, tea/coffee, juices.. LOCATION â€“ From train station - 10min walk (with luggage), including steps at 1 main bridge plus 2 small bridges. No hassle for us (30 years old). From St Markâ€™s Square â€“ They say its 30mins but it feels less and we strolled it and looked at lots of shops and scenery on the way. We felt the hotel recommendations for restaurants, gondola, and glass blowing, where because the hotel receives commission/kick-backs. although having said that, we had a good experiences at them all. The only thing we would mention to be mindful of is that if you arenâ€™t one for sales people and sales situation, donâ€™t go to their glass blowing experience on Murano island. The glass blowing demonstration was max. 10mins long then we spent the rest of the time trying to politely escape their sales people who really wanted to sell us a vase for 1,000 euro because I was silly enough to ask a question about it. It was a funny experience and we donâ€™t regret doing it (especially because we got a private water taxi out to the Island, all included in the 8 euro price). Overall, definitely recommend this hotel.
84. My daughter & I stayed here for one night in July 2011. We arrived by train and found the hotel without getting lost. It was very clean and well appointed. Room was very large. The only thing was, our bathroom was up two flights of stairs and down a service corridor. It was clean and well equipped etc., just not as convenient as having the bathroom adjoining your room. If I were to stay here again, I would make sure I had an ensuited room. Otherwise, vaporetto stop fairly close by and well located. We were leaving for Venice on the overnight train which didn't leave till 9pm, and the hotel allowed us to leave our bags there all day after we had checked out, which was appreciated.
85. This is a pleasant, clean and well run hotel, within 10 minutes walk of St Lucia station, with some good sized rooms, and some very small ones. The small ones are really only just enough to fit the bed in. It is close to a pontoon on the grand canal for private water taxis. It is not in a noisy part of the city, but convenient enough to vaporetto stops to get about easily. Prices are alright (for Venice), but I would not take their recommendations for restaurants too seriously. The one we tried was only average quality and very expensive.
86. After reading lots of reviews of this hotel i deceided to book it as i wanted something special for my wedding anniversary. On the day of departure we went to pay for our bill but for some unknown reason the travel card i had wasn't working. I kept putting my pin in but it kept refusing. The manager there was not helpful. She was rude & just kept talking over me. Because of her rudeness i had to walk away & so i deceided to phone the card people up to find out why it wasn't working. They informed me that i only had â‚¬415 instead of â‚¬545. I knew what was wrong. The hotel had blocked â‚¬125 from the card as a cancellation fee in case we didn't turn up so the amount i thought was on there wasn't & this was down to the hotel. The manager tried to hide it from us trying to steal money from us. As a manager they should know this & it's there duty to inform the customers of this which the manager of this hotel never. I will not be returning to this hotel again. If you go all i can say is watch your pennies!
87. Hotel has such attention to detail. We stayed in a Superior Room and it was fantastic. Clean and lovely, just a little dark though, but otherwise we couldn't fault it. There are also beautiful chandeliers all over the hotel. Service was great, especially the coffee & milk jugs at breakfast! Loved it, deserves much more than 3 stars.
88. We stayed in one of the 'red premium' rooms for one night in early July. It was one of the nicest hotel rooms we ever stayed in, complete with upholstered walls! The bathroom was very nice as well. The air conditioning was excellent, and while the wi-fi connection was inconsistent at times (they turn the wi-fi off at 8am on the day of checkout), this wasn't a major issue. The staff is very helpful and the breakfast was amazing. If you're familiar with Venice, you'll appreciate that this hotel is closer to the train station, and if you're willing to walk to San Marco (approx. 25 minutes) or pay a few bucks and travel on the water, you'll appreciate not lugging your bags all around Venice. Great hotel overall! Highly recommended!
89. Pretty little boutique hotel. Situated very close to the train station (1 waterbus stop away). A fantastic restaurant right around the corner from it as well. The furnishing are a bit weathered, mirrors were rusty but that wasn't a problem for us. The bed was comfortable and we had a good night sleep.
90. We loved this hotel. In a two-week trip through Italy which included some very pretty places, this was absolutely our favorite. It is a renovated duke's palace, open since May 2010 & they did an outstanding job of it, with upholstered walls, spacious glamorous bathroom, a marvelously comfortable bed, Venetian chandelier, and large rooms. Ours had a sofa, a desk, a king bed, & another table. Service was excellent; we got tips on where to go & how to get there. It was in a neighborhood, out of the way of the Rialto/St Mark's bustle, so it was very quiet at night. We ate one breakfast there, which was good but not included in price of stay & wasn't anything out of the ordinary. We were able to order an omelette though. Wonderful places to eat right around there, or take a water taxi anywhere. Can't say enough about this hotel, it was just incredibly beautiful & in the perfect location for us. We didn't do any business things so not sure if there is a computer for our use. I don't recall if they have wi-fi. Parking not an issue since cars are not allowed in Venice.
91. Beautiful hotel with beautiful rooms! We stayed at this hotel after seeing the great tripadvisor reviews, and were not disappointed! We had one of the gold rooms and it was very classy and clean. The hotel is not near the touristy areas, but since Venice is so small, it is so easy to walk everywhere. The staff were very nice, helpful, and always answered our questions. The service at breakfast was prompt and the food was good. We were in Venice during a heatwave, and the air conditioning was so good that we turned it off often! There are small restaurants steps away, and a grocery store just around the corner for essentials. My husband and I highly recommend.
92. My husband and I went to Venice after finishing a cruise. We stayed at this hotel and the staff were so friendly and helpful, especially Michelle. I have attached photos of the wheelchair accessible room and though not the standard we are used to in North America, it was pretty good after our experience in Barcelona. The hotel is very clean and in a good location by the Museum of Natural History (Museaodi Storia Nautrale) and very quiet. They offer a delicious breakfast in the morning, which is a great way to start your day before riding around on the water taxis (free if you are in a wheelchair). Of course our room on Holland America's Nieuw Amsterdam gave us much comfort to see parts of Europe, it was welcoming to have a hotel like this to finish our trip. Venice is VERY difficult in a wheelchair because of all the bridges being steep and staired. It was a real challenge to get around and we would not return to here because of those issues. The most accessible place we found in Venice was the Island of Lace (Burano) as it was very flat with many options of getting around and not so many staired bridges.
93. I cannot say enough about this small boutique hotel....and Katerina and the efficient staff that maintain this hotel. The location is outstanding.....in a real neighborhood, close to the first vaparetto stop, near the train station, but away from all the tourists. The hotel is newly renovated and has every ammenity. I originally tried to book a room in a hotel near the San Marco Plaza, but believe me you will love the quiet neighborhood, away from all the throngs and tourist action. All the tour books told us to get lost in the back streets, and that is exactly what we did...just headed generally for the main Rialto bridge....you will find your way, and a beautiful surprise around every corner. Do not even think of any other accomodation.
94. An 8 minute walk from the train station (P. Roma) following the "yellow signs" for the Natural History Museum gets you easily to this beautiful 300+ year old hotel. It's small (22 rooms) but elegant. We stayed in the very roomy Gold Tone Superior room with a shower. It had a very comfortable King Bed with a Murano Chandelier and very old wood parquait floors. The bathroom was recently remodelled with new fixtures and marble counters. It was very quiet since it's in the middle of a neighborhood. It's steps away from both a Vaporetto stop and a Traghetto and a 8 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge. You can walk anywhere in Venice from this hotel in 30 minutes or less! The breakfasts were good (especially the blood oranges, the prosciutto, and the pastries) . There is a great restaurant that is 1-2 minutes away (La Zucca) and a wonderful little grocery store with good inexpensive wines, gelato, and a great tiramisu for only 2.5 euro (It's called Majer). Highly Recommended!
95. There's a reason this is one of the top hotels on TripAdvisor - it deserves to be there. We stayed here for 2 nights early January, the first night in a Superior room, the second in the Classic room. Both were nice, but if you can, I would pay the extra and get the more spacious, lavishly decorated Superior room (pictured). Pros: EXCELLENT SERVICE! New, clean and elegantly decorated rooms. Free internet in your room (Ethernet cable provided). Very spacious in the Superior room. The continental breakfast was great - pastries, croissants, cereal, cheese, individual jars of jam ect. Excellent value for money. Cons: The hotel is small so there is no room service but that's about all I can fault. We would like to thank Caterina for being such an accommodating and helpful host. We had such a wonderful stay and will definitely be returning.
96. This is the hotel you are searching for. Very nice personel, very pretty hotel and so a very nice stay. We were here with two children (8) en (14) in a familyroom. Wifi worked very well. Left a big tip for the cleaninglady.
97. A group of 10 adults traveling together and we were all able to get rooms at this wonderful hotel; reserve early or it will be sold out! The hotel is beautifully decorated as well as the individual rooms. We asked that all our rooms were in the hotel and not in the adjoining building where they have an apartment. We all thought the location was perfect and enjoyed walking and getting lost (it's Venice!). It is near the train station and was an easy walk with luggage (only 1 or 2 bridges to get over). The breakfast was also nice and they made it especially for us since we were all leaving on an early train. Great service!
98. really great place for family, couples, friends, business everything. very good value for price, really pretty rooms. clean n staff was always very friendly and helpful. good location. good amenities except only 2/3 tv channels n like all hotels we stayed at in italy the tvs were like 8 inches! breakfast was ok. no fitness center or spa. its highlights were mainly its decorations n great staff n location.
99. Just a quick note to thank all the staff there for a very enjoyable stay â€“ particularly the young woman on reception who gave us much valuable information regarding things to do and where to eat. We stayed for 4 nights and the staff could not be more helpful. We stayed on one of the 3rd floor rooms, and whilst I would agree that the slanted ceiling in the bathroom could be challenging for taller guests, it posed fewer problems for us shorter people! Room was very comfortable and the air-conditioning was most welcome !! All in all I would recommend it for anyone wanting a "venice-reasonable" priced hotel, in a good location for exploring Venice on foot or via the waterboat.
100. Lovely small newly renovated hotel with clean room in a quiet neighborhood which suited us perfectly. The rooms had a classic decorations made it felt very special comparing to standard hotel room. The hotel can be easily accessed by 15min walk from Rialto bridge (airport link) or 5min from the St. Stae stop.There is a Traghetto (â‚¬ 0.5) crossing just next to the hotel, which we recommend to try.
