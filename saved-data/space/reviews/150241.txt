1. While planning our trip to Puerto Rico, I was shocked by how expensive most of the "nice" hotels were, even in low season (we went first week of April). This hotel lured me to book with it with its relatively lower price, nice photos, and good reviews. It turns out that the hotel IS pretty great. The front-desk staff was pleasant and helpful (we had to store our luggage with them for a day after checking out and there were no problems), the lobby was gorgeous, the breakfast was top notch (and free! ), and our room was perfect, with silky smooth bedsheets, a clean bathroom, and ample space. The only problem is when you step outside to use the pool and hottub - the swim-up bar is cute and the hamburger fare offered there is good (albeit a bit too salty), but every ten minutes it sounded like an airplane was about to crash-land on your head. I could not believe how noisy it was, and I've lived near LGA airport all my life. It was literally like the planes were landing next door (and I guess they sort of were). Fortunately, the hotel itself is well insulated, so the noise doesn't affect you at all when you're inside. If it weren't for the noisy pool, the hotel would be an easy A+ (and probably cost a lot more). As it is, I give it an A-.
2. My husband and I flew down to San Juan for our friends' wedding this past weekend. Since we knew we couldn't make this trip any sort of vacation, and to call it a getaway was pushing it, we wanted to stay somewhere clean, comfortable and efficient. We got that and so much more! The location was perfect. It's right across the street from the El San Juan hotel (site of the wedding), a Walgreens and Lupi's, a Mexican restaurant recommended to us (it did not disappoint). Plus, the value is the best I've seen in a long time. There's the free breakfast (not gourmet or cooked to order, but there were plenty of options and everything tasted good), the lovely pool area with swim-up bar and grill with burgers so juicy they rival those at In-N-Out and Five Guys, the comfy bed, the flatscreen TV with all the channels of home as well as a plethora of Spanish-speaking ones, the business center and the efficiency of check-in and check-out that could not be beat. Obviously it's not the best choice if you want a luxurious, long-term vacation. This is because it's not on the beach (but it's a block away), and if you want a poolside cocktail, you need to get up and get it yourself rather than have a waiter bring it to you. But I'd recommend this hotel to folks who either are in town briefly for an event or who need a place to stay before or after a cruise. Although, I must say we're tempted to stay here even for a full-on vacation after reading the horrible reviews about the cleanliness and service at the El San Juan hotel. The El San Juan is THE place to be for dancing and partying (and weddings -- the wedding we attending was fabulous), no doubt, but even we noticed dirty couches and an overall indifference of the staff when it came to actually doing their jobs.
3. I stayed with my bf. The bedroom is big & clean, the bed is super comfortable & king size, have a very good size TV, the bathroom was ok, but the bathtub was a bit small. The beach is 5 minute walk & you can find various fast foods near the place so you dont have to waste money. Overall, I had a lovely, fun & romantic experience. Can't wait to go back. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!
4. We just needed a place to stay for one night between getting back from Vieques and flying out of San Juan. This was a great place for that. The room was lovely and was air conditioned and had a TV with cable, which was nice after being in various locations around PR for 10 days. It was more of a suite than a room, with a living room area with a wet bar and then a separate room that was a bedroom. Both rooms had tvs. It was very close to the airport and the breakfast was nice and included with the room. We would definitely stay here again to be close to the airport, though if this is the only place you stay in PR, you are missing the best part.
5. This hotel was very nice and clean and the staff was very nice. However, the Isla Verde area is quite dumpy and I felt nervous walking around it. Also, the airplanes are way too loud and ruin the atmosphere. I was with my sister and our children and we were hit on more than once by some shady looking guys which made me really uncomfortable with our young children around. The beach in Isla Verde was dirty and stinky. We didn't even get wet. We stayed at this hotel because we had an early morning flight. I would only recommend staying there if you need to be close to the airport. We also stayed 4 days at the Carbie Hilton, which was very nice. If they could move the hotel to a nice part of town, I'd stay there again.
6. One of our better choices without breaking our budget . Clean and modern facility which even included breakfasts. We would have a quick breakfast and be gone all day seeing the island. Often didn't return to our room till late at night and were never disapponted with the hotel. Great facilty for familes - kids always were in the pool having fun.
7. This is a very nice hotel, We love ti, is very private, Front Desk all the agents there are very nice and friendly specially Dianna, she's always wealling to help. Housekeeping is excellent! Maintenance is great! this hotel is very clean, smells good, the pool is very confortable, the rooms are very nice, very clean and the beds are awesome! This hotel is very nice, confortable and customer service is great!
8. We stayed at Hampton Inn for one night pre-cruise. It was a quick 10 minute ride from the airport and about 20 minute drive to the Pan Am cruise pier. The morning of checkout we found an employee outside who was helping guests get cabs and we had no trouble finding one immediately. The rooms were quiet, in spite of the proximity to the airport. There are many restaurants within walking distance. We walked across the street and were on a beautiful beach within just a few minutes, where we enjoyed pleasant walk, then into the casino of the El San Juan Hotel for a little gambling in their casino. Then into the pool and hot tub for more evening relaxation. The Hampton staff could not have been more friendly and helpful! When we asked a question, they would respond and always add "...is there anything else I can do for you?" The breakfast buffet was excellent and plentiful, with lots of seating area and tables for everyone. Hampton exceeded my expectations and I would definitely stay there in the future.
9. Have stayed at this hotel twice pre cruise and loved it. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms a clean and comfortable. Location is very good 5 minutes from airport and a short walk to the beach. We find this hotel to be the best value for your dollar and have it booked again this year pre and post cruise, which we are very much looking forward to.
10. We were here for one night post cruise just to relax and we were delighted with the service and amenities. Wireless internet is a plus after being without for a week. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The location was decent just a two block walk to the beach and the main street. The beach was very nice. Would stay here again especially for the price booked with hotwire.
11. This is a fine location for a quick stopover in San Juan. The clean, nicely furnished hotel is in the Isla Verde tourist district immediately adjacent to the airport, close to several casinos and numerous eateries. People sensitive to noise should try to avoid rooms in Tower A, which is closest to the airport runways and immediately next to a cock fighting arena whose combatants greet the dawn collectively.
12. This is a great place to stay. Although there is airplane noise out at the pool, it was rarely heard inside. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The breakfast is great. The pool is wonderful and well kept. There are lots of good restaurants at the big hotels nearby but be prepared..they are pricey! all in all, we really enjoyed our stay here!! !
13. Prior to going to this hotel I did read a negative review about bedbugs; and the first thing I did when I got into the room was check for them--nothing! But what I will say is this, the hotel was very clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful; and the breakfast was excellent. Each morning we were up at 6 am, and at breakfast by 7:30 am. ; it was empty, quiet, and a pleasure. I grew up with parents who always left the hotel maid a tip, and I am no different, but I was really surprised that my maid, (her name is Blanca) did not take my tip; and I was curious why? Unfortunately, she didn't work on the weekends! Walgreens is right across the street, and also on that side of the street you can keep straight, veer off to your left, and you are on the beach. Its a beautiful beach, and is great for early morning risers and rising sun seekers. Loved it, and its really less than a 5 minute walk, at best. We also rented a car with Alamo, and the hotel charged only $5 a day for parking. Overall, it was a good hotel to stay at.
14. I took my two college age kids for a Chrismtas vacation and this hotel was very adequate and priced great. The beach is a few blocks away and there area ton of shops and restaurants close as well as a supermarket a few blocks away. It was a very safe area and i would recommend if you have a tight budget to stay here.
15. I think this is the nicest Hampton Inn we have stayed at. We paid in the mid 250s because everything was booked Presidents's Day weekend, but we were totally pleased with the hotel. I had previously stayed at the Hilton Caribe and really liked that - its a better location for getting to Old Town - but the Hampton is opposite the street from the Ritz and other hotels, allowing more access to restaurants, casinos, etc. The hotel is very clean (far more so than the four star El Conquistador Resort, for example!) and the beds are as good as the best Westin beds. The breakfast is an actual hot breakfast, plus so many other choices of cereals, juices, breads, and bagels, fruit, yogurt, granola, etc. - better than most Hampton Inns. The rooms were quite, the pool looked nice (we did not use) and the staff were helpful. I highly recommend this hotel over many four star establishments in Puerto Rico!
16. We just came back from beautiful San Juan and I have to tell you guys the hotel was almost perfect...buffet breakfast,reasonable price,kind and charming staff,pleasant pull (little bit dirty though ) good location...but....bed bugs!!!! I can't stop scratching my self!! So now you know, and I believe not every bed is infected ,but mine was...:( and yes internet was impossible to use cause it was too slow.
17. We stayed at the Hamtpon Inn & Suites for spring break and had a wonderful experience! It's a great hotel for the price, not to mention in a good location. The staff was very nice and offered lots of suggestions for places to eat and have fun; they also had answers to all our questions. The Business Center with free internet and printing was a nice surprise, and there was also wireless in the room. The hotel overall is well-kept and clean and the beds are small but comfortable. When I go back to Puerto Rico, I will definitely book at the Hampton Inn!
18. We got stuck in San Juan after being bumped off our flights all day long. We fly stand by, so we're not eligible to have our hotel paid for by the airline. We had just spent 4 days at the Embassy Suites Dorado del Mar, and had been at the airport since 5 AM. The last flight left at 7:45 PM without us on it and so we called around to find a hotel. We got to the Hampton Inn & Suites around 9 PM. We were exhausted. Since we are a family of 5, a room with 2 beds doesn't accomodate us. After explaning our situation with being stranded and having sat with 3 kids at the airport all day, I asked for a roll away and was told it was going to be another $20 or we could switch the room type and have a pull out couch for an additonal $40. The room rate was already pretty steep. Our rate for a suite at the Embassy Suites in Dorado which included 2 beds and a pull out couch on a beautiful resort property was less before these additonal charges even! We declined both and took the standard (overpriced) room. Our teenager slept on the floor. The room was nice, but a little worn. The walls had scuff marks on them everywhere and the furniture is pretty banged up. Also, the room is pretty cramped. The pool and the pool bar were right out side of our window, so it was a little noisy. We went back downstairs and asked if there was anywhere to eat. The front desk employees were friendly and helpful and gave us a lot of options of places we could walk to for dinner. We returned and went to sleep and checked out the next morning at 5 AM. This hotel is nice, but definitely overpriced.
19. We stayed at this hotel for one night. We booked through travelocity. We were delayed one night and travelocity said the hotel would not refund us our money for the night, so oh well, live and learn. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The room itself was pretty clean except for some black marks on the walls. I didn't complain because I was so exhausted from sleeping at the (ATL)airport the night before. I would stay here again for one night but if I was planning a longer stay in San Juan, I would pay the extra money for a four or five star resort.
20. This hotel has to be a sleeper. We have stayed in San Juan on 4 previous occasions over the past 10 years prior to cruising and this is by far and away the best hotel we have experienced. Not only is it less expensive than where we stayed in the past, the rooms (suites?) are larger - about 500 sq ft if you choose a poolview room - the entire hotel is spotless, it's within walking distance from many restaurants, other hotels, car rental agencies, and the beach which incidentally we don't think is that good. The modest comp breakfast satisfies, the burgers at the pool bar are super and the airport noise is a non issue in the rooms due to excellent double paned windows. Forget the over pricing at the hotels with casinos on the beach, you can walk to 3 of them from the Hampton and it's more comfortable.
21. We stayed at this place for 2 days...really a nice place to stay and is very near to airport aswell Old san Juan...checked in real quick..and the receptionist was very helpful in giving the maps and directions to Old San Juan...there was WIFI in the room...room service was good ..the only issue was the noise from the AC was not sure was this the problem with all the rooms or only with that of ours..:( and served the continental breakfast.The area nearby was gud for wandering..all together a nice place to stay...
22. We stayed here last Sunday for one overnight after disembarking from a 7 day cruise. This was our second stay here and it met our needs perfectly. We arrived at the hotel at about 8:30am and no surprise, there was no room ready for us. That was okay because we then took a ride (we rented a car from Avis after getting off the ship) to El Yunque rain forest and explored for a couple of hours. When we returned, the room was ready and we hung out at the pool for a while. We did plan to take advantage of the poolside grill for dinner, but when I walked up and ordered two burgers I was told that it would be at least an hour wait. Hmmm...we went to plan "B" and walked down to the beach/pier and went to a nice little restaurant instead - "La Playita." Our flight home was at 10:30am Monday so we had a leisurely morning to finish packing and have breakfast before the 5 minute ride to the airport. We had none of the problems listed in some of the prior reviews. I did not give it 5 stars because it is not a 5 star hotel. It's clean with a friendly staff and typical Hampton Inn amenities. We paid $190 US for this night. Staying that one extra night saved us about $400 on airfare, and twist my arm, I had to stay in Puerto Rico for one more night. It was a great addition to a wonderful vacation week.
23. Although this hotel costs more than I usually pay for Hampton, it is worth it. It is modern and clean as a pin. The location is excellent. It is a few steps from the beach and near many restaurants. The rooms have large flat screen tvs with adequate cable. There is free wifi and wired internet. They have a good breakfast with some hot items changing daily. What really makes this place special is the people running it. Although there is no conscierge, the front desk fills in admirably. They are anxious to make your stay pleasant and productive.
24. Perfect stop pre-approved by the flight crews! Stayed one night, Oct 6. Arrived early enough to enjoy the clean pool and tasty poolside grilled lunch of cheeseburgers and fries prepared to perfection, a bargain at $8. No South Beach diet, but we were on vacation. True, during the day the jets landing on the adjacent runway will momentarily shake your bones, but they don't fly at night. Took a cab to the fabulous (by any standard) Plaza las Americas Mall for the highest quality shops we've seen anywhere in the continental U.S., with better prices, too. The Hampton Inn rooms are spacious, safe and clean with very comfortable beds and all bedclothes are washed daily. Windows are double-paned to reduce noise, but I would request a room on the left wing as you face Reception farther from the runways if you want to nap during the day. Really, at night the noise is not a problem. The airlines would not put their crews there unless it was clean, safe and quiet and a good price close to the airport. Also, 2 blocks away is a fabulous, free, white powder sand beach with gentle waves, possibly the best beach we've ever enjoyed. This place could be a destination unto itself. Lots of good restaurants within safe walking distance. Prefer this to Old San Juan any day.
25. I have had several extended trips to San Juan this year, and I will only stay at the Hampton Inn & Suites on busy Isla Verde Avenue. It is close to the airport, where I was working, but also close to the beach and several restaurants, all within walking distance. There are also several other shops nearby for the everyday conveniences. Most nights I didn't even leave the hotel since there is a poolside bar and grill outside. Even though I was there on business, my evenings felt like a vacation. This hotel has all the Hampton Inn conveniences while maintaining the lad back Caribbean vibe.
26. Nice and clean, friendly staff, beautiful decor with a tropical theme through out the place. Pool was abit small and loud from the planes, but we wanted to be near the airport. The poolside bar and grill was fantastic thier burgers were nice and juicy with lots of flavor- only 6.50$( came with a side dish) No problems getting a reasonable cab to the airport. A short walk away you can go to the beach.
27. We had decided that we wanted to stay an extra night in Puerto Rico to visit more of the island after we completed our Carribean cruise. We found this hotel through hotels.com and carefully read the reviews before we left. Since the overall rating was good, we decided to book. And we were happy to see that we had made the right pick. Check in was fairly quick even though there was a long line-up upon arrival. Parking cost less than $6 tax in for guests.The room was beautifully furnished with top notch furniture and comfortable bedding. The business center had three computers with complimentary internet access (very slow though at times). Complimentary breakfast offered waffles, eggs, sausage, all types of breads, coffee cakes, cereals, fresh fruit, orange juice, and good coffee. Everything was delicious except for the sausage which looked really dry and not too apetizing. Great location, 5 minutes walk from beach and about 15 minutes from airport. Hotel has a beautiful jacuzzi and outdoor pool with pool bar. Pool towels are provided even when we went to the beach. The pool bar also prepared barbecued food and we absolutely LOVED their baby-back ribs made by Jay. Remember that name, cause he is the guy you want behind the grill and who will make the difference in your appreciation of this meal. He is such a pro at this and trust me you won't eat any other ones like these! Chicken burger was also very tasty and juicy as well as their hamburgers. Salad side dish was not very generous, so we ommitted the chips and asked for more greens, which they happily did. Drinks are very cheap. We stayed at a different hotel when we arrived in Puerto Rico the day before our cruise and we were very disappointed, even though the cost was very comparable. So this one is definitely a keeper!
28. Clean rooms, wonderful front desk staff, great breakfast buffets. I had one small problem with my phone and one of the maintenance personnel overhead my comment. Next thing I know, he's upstairs fixing the phone! What service! Very personable staff - always friendly and polite. I can't say enough about them. The Tuesday night buffets are okay - get there early because the food does run out! The food by the pool area is good. As with everything in Puerto Rico, make sure you allow plenty of time - it's definitely NOT fast food! Close to the airport, but you can't hear the noise unless you're by the pool. You really can't go wrong here!
29. My wife and I went on a cruise and stayed at the Hampton Inn for a few days beforehand so we could see San Juan. The inside of the hotel, especially the rooms, are beautiful. It is a nice looking place and service was good. The breakfast was so-so, not bad, but definitely not great either. My primary reservation with the hotel was the price: 1) Nothing says class like a cock fighting arena outside your window. 2) Going to the beach is a 10 minute walk and once you get there, it is not automatic that you will find a beach chair. 3) A taxi to Old San Juan is $20 each way. We took the public bus for $0.75 each, but it took roughly 50 minutes each way. 4) When at the pool, you could almost feel the wind from the jet engines. None of these are deal-breakers, but I thought the price of $200 a night was a little high (it felt like a $120 hotel). I talked with someone in a nearby restaurant who was at the Courtyard about 5 minutes away, and he paid $20 less a night and was on the beach. If I did this again, I think I would definitely try this next.
30. I stayed here for three nights, April 20th to 23rd, 2010. I stayed in room # 333. I paid $ 135 USD per night. This hotel belongs to the Hilton family of hotels. I really enjoyed my stay. My room was a one King bed room. Great bed, clean linen. The room was very clean. I had free WiFi internet in the room. Free breakfast was included in the price. I have read that other guest's paid $ 5 USD for parking. I had a rental car, and, the front desk always validated my parking ticket, everytime I wanted to depart the hotel. I don't think the front desk makes this function known, and, those other guest's probably never asked. The palapa bar out by the swimming pool, is a great place to un-wind every night. They do grill up some nice meals there for you, along with refreshing drinks. The only planes I ever heard taking off or landing, was when I was out at the palapa bar. When in my room, I never heard any jet noises at all. I definately recommend this hotel to everybody. On my future visits to Puerto Rico, I will be booking this hotel again.
31. Room is good. (King suite facing pool). Average condition, few amenities (no bar, restaurant, etc...except pool bar w/food outside). Quiet...except for some airport noise and loud voices from adjoining room through closed doors. Typical free Hampton breakfast buffet. However, lousy neighborhood. Run down, dirty streets and buildings. Nearby beach is dirty with piles of sea weed. Next time I would pay the extra for Condado area resort hotel or stay in Old San Juan. It's $50 round trip cab, incl tip to Old San Juan, where all the city's character is. Spend a day touring Old San Juan, impressive castles/forts, neat streets and shops. $19 plus tip to Pan American cruise ship dock from this hotel.
32. My wife and I spent a long weekend in Puerto Rico to visit with our son who had been working here for the last several months and to get a break from the cold. We chose the Hampton Inn after reading the reviews here. I have to say that this hotel exceeded my expectations. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast in the lobby each morning was just right, it saved time and money. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. I don't know if I would recommend this someone who was looking for more of a resort stay. I think if you came to Puerto Rico and only stayed in the vicinity of the hotel, you would miss a lot of the charm and beauty of the island. We used this as a base to operate from and traveled all over the island. There is a lot at the hotel though; Walgreen's across the street and several restaurants in walking distance. A two block walk to the beach was not a problem. When we went to that beach I noticed a resort with umbrellas and lounge chairs approximately 100 yards from where we set up our towels. I walked over to get a better look and discovered that it was the Ritz-Carlton. I'm certain that none of the people there paid $179 a night to get to that beach. The pool, hot tub and swim up bar at the hotel were great. You could spend your vacation there and have a great time. On Monday we took the 75 cent bus trip to Old San Juan and explored. The desk clerk gave us excellent advise on which bus to take and also told us to take the free trolley to the farthest point out once we arrived at the bus station. That way we could work our way back through the city going downhill. That worked out great. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
33. We stayed here for just one night after a late arrival into San Juan. The cab ride from the airport to the hotel was $12-$15. The room was a little small for a Hampton Inn, but still very comfy. We had enough room with our baby's travel crib to use the desk and lounge chair all at the same time. Very comfy bed, great water pressure, & nice continental breakfast. The pool area with bar looked really nice, but we didn't stay long enough to try it. The price was reasonable compared to the other options in the area.
34. Stayed here mid Nov and loved it. The outside pool bar has great. The food is outstanding and the drinks were reasonably priced. Room was clean and quiet. Great location walk to beach, walgreens, restaurants. Safe neighborhood. Hotel parking $10 a night
35. We have stayed at the Hampton Inn a few times before, and it was always only for a night or two before a cruise. The hotel is nice, but I wouldn't want to stay for longer than a few nights, seeing as there's not a ton to do. The location is pretty good, there are some nice restaurants and a beach nearby. The pool is good. You can get food, like burgers and grilled cheese, from the bar near the pool. There's a hot tub too and lots of chairs to sit on. The rooms are pretty good. They have a good amount of space, we could fit our whole family of five in one room, which had two queen beds and we had a rollaway as well. The first time we stayed here we had a nice view of the pool, the second time we had an ugly view of the parking lot, but we didn't mind much. Breakfast is great. It's free and a buffet is set up so you can get your breakfast in the lobby. They have coffee, cereal and fruit as well as some hot food like sausage and eggs, as well as toast. For other meals you have to eat at the bar by the pool or go to a nearby restaurant. The location was good here, because it was just a short walk to the beach and many restaurants, however it was very close to the airport as well, which is both good and bad. Good because it doesn't take long to get to the hotel, but bad because there are always planes passing by so it's quite noisy. I would recommend this hotel if you need somewhere to stay for a short amount of time before a cruise, or if you don't plan to do much on your vacation.
36. Stayed here in March, 2006 The Good: Overall itâ€™s a nice hotel, although its far from a new property. The breakfast ins included and they do a nice job- choice of coffees and tea, fruit, a hot item, cereals, yogurt etc. The business center is a nice plus and offers free printing. The pool is on the small side- but never looked crowded. The people are friendly The not so good: The hotel has suites and standard rooms- I was in a standard room. The furniture is newer, but the rooms themselves are kind of beat up ( some mildew on the over calked bath tub, â€œblackâ€� material coming from the piper in the tub, etc.). The hotel is very close to the airport and if you have the windows open you feel like you are sleeping on a run way. As with most Hamptons â€“ this location offers no room service or restaurant- there is however a snack area at the pool- but it closes fairly early. Summary- stay there if the price is right but compare the Marriott Price and Availability first
37. I've stayed at dozens of properties throughout the Hilton family, ranging from high-end Waldorf Astoria properties in New York or the Conrad in the Maldives, to not-so-stellar places such as airport Hampton Inns. Because this property was so close to San Juan airport, I was assuming it'd be like your typical airport budget hotel...but was surprised and delighted to see it was not. This property is great --good location, great staff, and nice interiors/rooms --definitely the best Hampton Inn I've stayed at.... and generally nicer than more than 70% of Hilton Hotels I've stayed at. The lobby featured new/modern decor...as did the room. The bed/furnishings were high quality....and the materials in the bathroom (granites and beautiful tile) were too. The room was quiet and very clean --I remarked at how "fresh" the room smelled when I first walked in. They provided the typical Hampton Inn breakfast, which included fruits, cereals, carbs, and some hot options which included cheese omelets, bacon, and make-your-own waffles. There was plenty of self-dispensed juice to drink too in addition to coffee. You can eat at table seating, bartop seating, or outdoors by the pool. The pool was nice --large and clean, and featured a swim-up bar to a bar/grill in the rear of the property. The food at the pool bar/grill was top-notch; I was shocked I was eating in a Hampton Inn and shocked I was eating at a pool bar/grill with the type of quality I was enjoying. Bar/grill staff were very friendly. Front desk staff was cheery and helpful. There was an error on my folio at check-out that they promptly fixed. The location is good; a short 2-3 minute walk across the street brings you to the Ritz Carlton, other nearby casinos, or the beach. I felt safe in and around the hotel. Overall, a great stay in a great property with great service. So much so the hotel should bear a more upscale brand than "Hampton Inn."
38. I travel to PR several times a year and always stay at the Hampton Inn in Isla Verde. I always have a wonderful experience - the staff are very friendly and helpful (will always point you to a great restaurant or book a local tour), the rooms are large and clean, and the location is excellent. You have a short walk to the beach, a ton of restaurants, and bars. There are several other large hotels nearby (on the beach) that are extremely overpriced and stuffy. I have stayed in a variety of these hotels as well and always have a poor experience. I highly recommend the Hampton Inn!
39. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The whole hotel is clean and pleasant to be in. Parking is an extra $5 a day but that us fair compared to other locations in the area. Breakfast is included but if your kids like cereal ask for it. For those who keep kosher, Chabad is a five minute walk from the hotel.
40. Just returned from a quick trip to PR with mom to celebrate her 60th. Love the place and the people. We took a jr. suite facing the pool. We had 2 double cloud 9 beds and a large tv in the bedroom. A nice kitchen area with sink, coffee maker, microwave, and mini frig. We also had a living room with couch, chair, desk/table with 2 side chairs and a large tv. All was clean and very nice. Continental breakfasts w/ 2 hot items (eggs/sausage) were provided until 10 am and coffee/tea provided 24 hours. The breakfast made it easy to get our day started without figuring anything out. Pool and jacuzzi are nice with fluffy towels provided. Staff is friendly - recommending buses, restaurants and even having a few menus on hand. Location is very convenient to the airport and you can walk to the beach in a few minutes (ask staff where best beach is since access is limited due to private bldgs and homes). If you take public bus route A5 into Old San Jan as we did expect at least a 1/2 hour ride with a close up experience to PR and its wonderful and warm people. Great restaurant deli across the street - I know it looks like a diner but it is good. Metropol on the other side of the cockfighting arena next door had wonderful cuban fare and drums located in the Isle Verdre mall (2 o'clock from the Hampton front door) had a wonderful red snapper special as well as PR appetizers.
41. This hotel - I think - is supposed to be a business hotel. As a business hotel, it's got some very nice features: 2 minutes from the airport, decent internet bandwidth, a nice business center with 4 HP towers and a laser printer, quick dry-cleaning, in-house coin laundry, quick in-and-out parking, and very close to restaurants. However, the hotel is 2 blocks from the beach. As a result, the clientele is a bit skeevy. Small children in wet bathing suits running wild in the hallways, screaming to all hours. Teen baseball teams creating long lines, noise, and chaos at breakfast. To me, businessmen and vacationers do not make a good mix. But the hotel staff were perfectly bi-lingual (surprisingly rare in Puerto Rico), very cordial and helpful, and I would have to say overall my experience at this hotel was a good one. I think next time I will stay at the Doubletree, which is not near the beach and seems a bit more business-oriented.
42. I recently spent 30 days at this hotel. The staff was very accomodating to every need a long term client can have. Great rooms with essentials to survive away from home. Did not use most of the facilities but they all looked clean and inviting. Highly recommended and it is now part of the Hilton family for those of us that like to get points for our stays.
43. We had never been to the Isla Verde area but decided to stay there overnight so we would be close to the airport for an early morning flight. We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel's location which was within walking distance to upscale restaurants and casinos. The area felt very safe also. The hotel was very clean, staff very helpful and we chose a King suite overlooking the pool which was fantastic. We did not get a chance to use the pool but it looked very nice. They had a manager's reception in the early evening with drinks and opportunities to talk to the other guests and staff - very nice touch. The breakfast was good and as an added bonus we were at the airport within 15 minutes.
44. The staff is great. The rooms are clean and well kept. The breakfast is excellent. The swim up bar and grill is pretty awesome too! If you don't want to pay Old San Juan prices, but want to be close to all the activities this is a great option. The Isla Verde area is great! You are only a 5 minute walk to the beach, a 10 minute drive to the airport, and a 15 minute drive to Old San Juan, plus there are tons or shops and restaurants just a few steps from the hotel. We will certainly be back!
45. My wife and I stayed here for one night prior to boarding a cruise. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms spacious and well appointed, and there was plenty to keep us busy on site/nearby (pool, fitness center, beach nearby, plenty of restaurants within walking distance, casinos, shopping, etc). Pool and hot tub were both well maintained and there was a swim-up bar that served drinks and food. The free hot breakfast in the morning was stocked with everything you could imagine for breakfast. Free WiFi too. Only two negatives and both were minor. First, it was right next to the airport and so the noise of planes taking off during the day was a bit distracting. Also, we had no HOT water (lukewarm only) in the morning for showers.
46. I am a Hilton HHonors Diamond Member with more than 100 stays per year at the Hilton Hotels, this hotel was the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at, the place seemed like it was from the 1960's, the beds were horrible, the staff's attitude was very conflictive, this hotel should be priced at around $59 per night and not at $189. What a disgrace to Conrad Hilton; the pool, the carpet, the paint, the beds; were all dilapidated. My family and I decided that after a few days, it was time to move on, at which point we advised the hotel and they were insulting by saying "Well, guess its time to go home, because Puerto Rico is expensive," and I responded with "NO, we are moving to a real hotel, like the Embassy Suites; once we arrived at the Embassy Suites, the hotel manager personally took care of us and gave us the Diamond Member treatment. For a difference of only $20, our family was able to recuperate from the dreadful mistake of staying at the "Worst Hampton in All of the America's." This hotel is probably ok for the flying crew; as they are only in for a night, but not for families. My kids had a wonderful time at the Embassy Suites with a Cascading Waterfall and water toys to pass several hours; also the breakfast and food was far superior to anything served at the Hampton. At the Hampton, the cafeteria or area serving food, closed at around 9p.m., what a disappointment. No more stays at Hampton Inns, neither in Puerto Rico nor anywhere else.
47. I chose this hotel because of the location - close to the airport and the beach area. We stayed after our cruise and really lucked out with this place. It was very clean, had friendly and helpful staff, and a great hot breakfast! The pool patio was very clean and inviting, with a hot tub and bar in the same area. Our room was large with two comfortable queen size beds, and the bathroom was also very large and clean. They also provide free internet from either your room or the computer room off the foyer. They are close to a number of restaurants and bars for either local cuisine or your standard North American chains. We two women felt quite safe walking around outside (however, I wouldn't venture down to the beach at night), with many police patrols visible. It's only a $20 taxi ride to downtown Old San Juan. Highly recommended! !
48. We stayed here after our first hotel overbooked and sent us to a dump we refused to stay in- I called this hotel and asked if they had any availability. They had one room to offer and we snatched it up to get out of where we were. We only stayed one night but would stay again. Nice area, comfortable to walk around in at night- rooms were nice, breakfast was good. We didn't spend a lot of time here (late arrival and left San Juan the next morning for Luquillo) but it was a nice hotel.
49. We visited this hotel on May 9, 2009. We stayed there because we were taking the Royal Carribean cruise which left the next day. This hotel was beautiful!! It is very clean and the complimentary breakfast was excellent. The staff was very professional and helpful to us. We were very pleased with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
50. I've stayed at the Hampton several times over the years on business, as well as some of the fancy hotels nearby on Isla Verde. For a clean and nice place to sleep, as well as a friendly staff, cheap parking and free internet this is the only place in the San Juan metro area that I can recommend. Sure other places are right on the beach, have a fancy pool with $7 cokes and bottles of water, so leave that to the tourists. Lots of flight crews stay here, as well as people coming in early or staying an extra day after a cruise or caribbean vacation while waiting on a flight at the airport (literally right behind the hotel). The staff is extremely friendly and the entire property is very clean, which is a luxury in and of itself in PR. If you are looking for the fancy hotel lobbys, restaurants and expensive restaurants they are all within a 5 minute (or less) walk from the front door. The beach is also 2 blocks away. Just take the side street next to the Walgreens and it drops you right on the same strech of sand used by the Ritz Carlton. This is one of the best Hampton Inns in North America. I'll be back.
51. My coworker/friend met me at this hotel to finish the last leg of my solo vacation so I was anxious to have some company. My coworker is a younger person who has limited finances so I was hoping that everything was up to par so that she can enjoy her vacation. We were not disappointed with this hotel. The location was very close to the airport, taxi to the hotel was $12. The hotel staff are very nice and helpful. The hotel, room and grounds are very clean and comfortable. Not on the beach but close enough. Free breakfast was acceptable and satisfying to start the day. Plenty of food places close by. I arrived at 9am and was immediately checked in - no waiting till 3pm. I sure didn't want to haul my luggage around until 3pm. The beds are comfortable and the pillows the best. Free wi-fi either in the hotel or your room
52. I was in San Juan for a week for business so I wasn't going to be spending a lot of time at the hotel. I just wanted a clean, comfortable room in a convenient location. The Hampton Inn was perfect. There's plenty of parking which was a big plus and for only $5 a day. The room has a nice big flat screen tv and a refrigerator which is nice as I like to keep cold water and some beer in the room. The desk staff was very helpful in recommending places to eat. The pool area is very nice and very clean. There is a swim-up bar and grill which has very good food. If I go back to Puerto Rico for busniness I'll definitely stay here again.
53. It's no 5 star resort if that's what you are looking for. It's intended purpose is that of a typical airport inn and you will find several pilots, flight attendants, and business people staying there. However, it was quite inpressive for the money. The prices are low and for that price the rooms are comfortable, clean and updated, the lobby is nice, nice pool, great location, and friendly staff. My 2 friends and I stayed there for a vacation trip and were very happy. It's a short walk to the beach, restaurants, bars, clubs and casino's. I would stay there again if returning to San Juan.
54. Would highly recommend this hotel. We stayed the last night our vacation to be near the airport. The rooms are wonderful, beds are very comfortable, pool area is great. The price was reasonable and the complimentary breakfast is very good. There are restaurants across the street. We only heard the airplanes when we were outside.
55. I stayed at the Hampton with my wife, my son and his wife the night before our cruise left port. Other than the double beds being a bit cozy, we had a good stay here. The breakfast in the morning was good and the front desk personel were very friendly and helpful.
56. We came in a couple days before a cruise and stayed here. Someone in our group had been there before and recommended it. The rooms were nice and our stay there was pleasant. There was free breakfast in the morning that was very sufficient. One night a neighboring room was having a fight in the middle of the night. We called security and it was taken care of very quickly. There is a Walgreen's within walking distance if you need to buy a few last minute items before cruising.
57. I recently stayed here with friends for a bachelorette party. THE GOOD: Rooms are clean, the hotel staff was nice (talk to Omar at the front desk). THE BAD: It is not a beachfront property, so you have to walk 2 blocks to the beach (not bad). The beach within walking distance is dirty (cigerette butts everywhere). I recommend researching where the cleaner beaches are on the island. Additionally, go early for breakfast (they stop replenshing the hot breakfast after 9). THE UGLY: The pool is absolutely disgusting. You cannot even see the bottom on the 3 foot side. There are things floating in there, that make you want to vomit. OTHER TIPS: Cabs are very expensive, so rent a car. You can rent one at the Ritz down the street. Go to El San Juan Hotel & Casino to party / drinks. Their lobby is very lively. Lupi's is the only 24/7 eatery around, its not good, but if you gotta eat, you gotta eat! Definitely go to Old San Juan - the restaurant "Mira Buena" is delicious! And also, for authentic local PR food, go check out the food Kiosks on the east tip of the island (30 min drive). I recommend Kiosk #38.
58. We stayed the last night of our vacation here. It was very clean and comfortable. A breakfast is included in your rate (cheese omelet ,sausage,bagels,cereal,yogurt,etc.). There was some airport noise due to how close the hotel is to it. Only a 5 min taxi ride away . Also, a 5 min walk to the Isla Verde beach. I would recommend this hotel.
59. Second time in 12 months at this hotel and another outstanding stay. Obviously many people want an "on the beach" resort, but if you are willing to walk across the street, your savings and satisfaction will be met here! Inexpensive parking, the most friendly front desk staff available, a fantastic poolside grill, clean rooms, linens and comfy beds. This is a fantastic hotel. Breakfast is unbeatable and they change it up daily. The pool grill has fantastic food at a very affordable price for families. Your walk across the street can take you to the Pine Grove area of Isla Verde....go right toward the Ritz resort or the western side near the El San Juan - you must try both sides.......so fun! We can't say enough positive about the Hampton and it's staff.
60. This hotel was perfect for what we needed for a pre-cruise stay of one night. After a very long day including 2 flights and lost luggage we were beat. The hotel is close to the airport, there is a pharmacy across the street and a great pool area. It was clean and safe and staff was friendly. The little grill by the pool was awesome and the burgers were delicious. We expected very limited choices but their menu was a lot broader than we expected, including chicken and even, I think, steak. Breakfast was larger than your usual continental type and more than what we needed. We would stay here again.
61. The best feature of this hotel is the pool and the breakfast. The pool has a swim up bar but was rarely seen being used during our 10 day stay. The pool area is clean but the lounge chair cushons could be taken better care. The hot breakfast was nice but could offer a few options. The fresh waffles that were offered daily were a nice addition. The fruit was quite sour and the eggs were a bit dry but can't complain too much as there is a larger variety than what Ive had at other hotels. The rooms were clean and housekeeping was there first thing in the morning. The staff was very courteous and professional. I would stay here again.
62. Very nice hotel, breakfast buffet included and only $5/day parking. Close to Pueblo supermarket, airport and various restaurants. Good service by the front desk: when I had a problem with the wifi internet, they brought me a regular wired modem. Can be busy at weekends: there was a very long queue at the front desk to check out when we were checking in early.
63. Before we were ready to take off on first cruise, we stayed at the Hampton Inn & Suites in Isla Verde. It is well located, being about 15 minutes from the airport and in walking distance to key places in Isla Verde. The front desk staff was very friendly from the first point we arrived. I liked how they had free drinks all day. The interior of the property was nice, but the room was worn around the edges. It was obvious that the lobby and other areas of the hotel were refurbished while the rooms were a bit neglected. However, the room was spacious, and the beds were comfortable. We had a nice view of pool. The free breakfast was a plus and helped to save time since we had a tour of El Yunque rainforest the next morning. On our first day, I really wanted to try the infamous El Churry sandwich, which has three types of meats served from a food truck on Isla Verde street where we where staying. It was a long walk from the hotel through rain and way at the other end. Sadly, when we got there around 4 p.m., the truck was closed. However, that night we walked across the street to another Hilton property, El San Juan Resort & Casino, and caught a free concert featuring the Gypsy Kings. Overall, it was a nice stay at the Hampton Inn and in Puerto Rico.
64. Stayed here for a night while connecting flights. Friendly, nice pool where we hung out with the kids, breakfast was good, good pool food at the grill, took the family suite which was perfect for us (we're four). Convenient to get to the airport. Supermarket nearby (walking distance). Old San Juan is lovely to visit. Recommend
65. Went to the Heineken Jazz Fest and choose to stay here for the good price. Hotel is in a excellent location with Denny's and a CVS across the street. The food from the pool bar was grilled and great. The only complaint I have was that the maid came early in the morning twice and opened the door with a fast knock while we were sleeping. The 2nd time she came back I told her to come back in a half hour. When I left the room all of the clean ladies where in the hallway still working and said hi to us. When we came back to the room 4 hours later the room wasn't cleaned. We had to call the front desk for soap and clean towels. The next day was our check out day and the maid still came knocking on the door early in the morning. Other than that the staff was very friendly! The room we had (453) had water stains on the wall by the door from an apparent leak from the ceiling, but it didn't effect our stay at all.
66. We stayed at Hampton Inn for one night pre-cruise. After arriving on a "red eye" from the west coast, we were fairly tired and ready to relax a bit. Even though it was only 11AM, the hotel staff was kind enough to allow us to check in early and gave us our keys right away. The hotel was clean and while this is no "resort", it has everything you could need for a short stay of 1 or 2 nights. The pool is small but nice and even has a swim up bar at one end. The bar cooks burgers, hot dogs and few other local items. It's a great little area just just relax and enjoy the tropics after a long flight. The rooms are fairly well kept and the bedding was clean. Even though it's located pretty close to the airport, noise was not a factor while inside. While at the pool, the planes could still be heard, but it's a momentary distraction at best. The hotel has a couple of other nice features like a business center that had 5 computers (great for emailing friends/family and gloating that you have arrived in the Caribbean) and also a self-serve breakfast in the morning. Breakfast alone probably saved the three of us $40. While the hotel is not located very close to Old San Juan (about 15 minutes away), taxi service was easily available. Also, since Hampton is close to the airport, the taxi from the airport was not overly expensive. There are plenty of restaurants and casinos nearby. Our only wish would be that the hotel had an airport shuttle. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here and it's perfect for pre or post cruise nights. Hampton Inn is a good choice for keeping your budget in check, but still getting a few perks.
67. Having stayed at this hotel a few years back and having a positive experience, we booked a pre-cruise overnight for this trip. Again, we were not disappointed. The hotel is clean, has a nice pool with a swim-up bar, free wi-fi, and a great complimentary breakfast. It is within walking distance of the beach, casinos, restaraunts, and various stores. It is about 5 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from the cruise port.
68. This is a very good hotel and an incredible value. Traveling with hungry teens, the breakfast bar was great for stretching our meal budget. We stayed in a two room suite which was great for a week long stay, so we would not tripping over one another. The beds were incredible... crisp and clean with two choices of pillows (soft & firm). The overall hotel (both interior and exterior)was nicely decorated and the pool area was lovely (especially at night). The hamburgers at the poolside grill were delicious ( a big hit with my teens) and convenient. The hotel is within walking distance of the beach, a Walgreens, a city bus stop, and literally dozens of resturants. We ate at several of the local ones, and never had a bad meal. Only a few details kept this hotel from getting a perfect mark...First, we had water leak from the room above us (in the shower) but someone came up right away to address it and clean up, but it was still a small annoyance and the plumbing needs to be addressed before it becomes a regular occurance....they could stand to vaccum the hallways/rooms and pool a little more often, and they should paint the interior room doors (they were off-white) and refinish the bathtubs. As these areas need some attention, overall though this is a solid establishment.
69. My husband and I just arrived home after a wonderful week at the Hampton Inn & Suites in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This hotel is absolutely the best we have stayed at. Its very cozy and has a home feeling. The customer service staff is the greatest! We miss it already and if you're looking for a nice place to stay, please try the Hampton Inn. Thank you to all the ladies in customer service. They are the best!
70. We stayed for one night pre-cruise and used points to pay for the room so the price was right. Otherwise it would have run us about $250 for the night. The front desk staff was very helpful, the room was nice and clean and there were many places to walk out for dinner. The pool area is attractive - decent sized pool, small hot tub, comfy loungers and a good bar/grill (I also agree the hamburger is excellent). You do hear noise from the airport when the planes take off (rendering conversation impossible for 30 seconds at a time), but it's no big deal.
71. This was our third stay at the Hampton Inn this year and my second review. I had to take one star off of the previous review due to a backslide in the housekeeping department. Upon first checking in for this stay we were assigned a room upstairs. The room looked like it had been cleaned and made up properly but upon inspection, I noticed that one of the beds had small black hairs all over it. I went downstairs and they immediately assigned me another room, this one being on the first floor. All was well the first night but again the housekeeping showed signs of weakness. Two of the four nights we were there we did not receive any washcloths. One of the nights our clean bath towels were draped over the toilet tank instead of on the rack...disgusting. It was also obvious that our sheets were never changed for our four night stay. I find that unacceptable as well. We leave tips every day and are very tidy in our room because we do not like to be a burden on the staff but this was obviously not appreciated. Other than those issues, the hotel is still a good bet. They are under renovation right now but travelers are not inconvenienced by it at all. I believe the renovation is supposed to be completed by the end of November. The free breakfast has been moved from the lobby to a conference room down the hall. Parking is still a bargain at $5 a day. (Other hotels charge between $15 - $20.) The Wifi signal also seemed stronger than on my previous visit in June. I did not have any trouble connecting with my mobile device. This hotel is frequented by many business travelers and airline staff as well. It is not a resort but a solid hotel in the Isla Verde area. I hope they address the housekeeping issues.
72. I would like to inform you of our recent stay at the Hampton Inn Suites Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I reserved 3 suites. We had one suite reserved for 5-28-10 the suite was ready and my sister could immediately check in. We had a connecting suite for 5-29-10. When my wife and I arrived we learned that one of our suites were accidentally booked the prior day. We spoke with the Manager, who apologized for the mishap and advised that she would do her best to accommodate us. Not only did she do her best she went above and beyond and we just wanted to let everyone know that we had a wonderful time at the hotel, we were very satisfied with the rooms, the staff was great, the free breakfast was an added treat, the food at pool side was fantastic. We look forward to our vacation there next year. I am so glad my wife booked reservations at this hotel. A few of our family and friends stayed at some of the pricier hotels and they informed us that the service was not that great. Again, I would like to thank the staff at the Hampton Inn & Suites for their exceptional hospitality.
73. We came into Peurto Rico late and had previously booked another hotel. The hotel we had chosen was not going to work so we called a travel agent and she booked us at the Hampton. The first three nights our air was not working and we had someone come and fix it however it did not work. The phone in our room was also out of order. They had attempted to fix it but that did not work. We had a wedding to attend and we called again about the air and someone from the front desk came up to see that it was very warm and went ahead and switched us to a new room. We were late to our wedding due to switching rooms 2 hours prior to the wedding. The pool was a beautiful place to be. The airplanes were loud but tollerable. However people were constantly having to ask for towels. The bar by the pool had wonderful burgers available all day. On our third day the bar ran out of Corona, Nanchos, limes, and Medalla. This to me was frusturating. Some people go on vacation to sight see and others go to lay pool side and soak up the sun and just be free of a schedule and with these luxuries missing that is not easliy accomplished. The hotel was a very nice place to stay and I would recommend it. I feel that they really need to be more orgainized and on top of things after all you are not spending $1900.00 for two beds and a nice shower. We were compt one night and a rollaway bed. To me that is just not right when they clearly say Hampton Inn 100% Gurantee.
74. We stayed here prior to a cruise as we had last year.Following our earlier stay I gave a generally positive review of this hotel (on February 13, 2006) except for the malfunctioning air conditioning unit for which we were given a suitable adjustment (we were compted). No such problem this time as every thing was fine, No airport noise in the room, the pool was great, the area has a lot to offer as far as restaurants etc. This is not a fancy hotel , but a Hampton INN and one of the better ones at that. One criticism I have is the price of ALL of the hotels in San Juan which have been creeping upward in each of the past 5 years I have been visiting San Juan. I believe an AARP rate of $200 is too expensive for this hotel just as the $300-$500 rates are too expensive for the fancier hotels nereby that were in the $200 plus range only a few years ago..
75. Before I even begin to review this hotel, I have to commend the staff at this hotel. Let's be honest, we all well know that Hampton Inns are in the lower spectrum of the Hilton chain. That is no secret, and this hotel does not deviate from the obvious. So, what separates one chain from another is its staff and the little things that people do to make your stay memorable, comfortable and in this case (with hurricane Irene in tow) bearable. With more than a million people in Puerto Rico without electricity and some even without water, the Hampton Inn in San Juan, kept its composure and more importantly, electricity, water, food, entertainment and surprisingly enough, internet service as well. People were fed, attended to and serviced with a smile. Rooms were clean and everything in my room was in perfect order. Remember that the people who work at the hotel are residents of the island and them too, had no power or water. They showed up and displayed their best. The hotel offered a very nice breakfast, had DVD movies showing at the lobby and kept the small but adequate fitness room operating so that people would have a choice and avoid "cabin fever". The hotel is relatively a short walk to the beach which normally I would had checked out. I hope this comment gets to everyone at the hotel and most importantly, to the powers to be and recognize these wonderful people that pulled it together in the face of adversity.
76. We stayed here for 2 nights after a trip to Culebra before flying back to Florida. We found the hotel to be very helpful, allowing us to check in early and giving various directions when needed. The room was spotlessly clean and we paid $127 a night. We got a ground floor room which had TV with cable(BBC World News was nice for us Brits), huge bed, free WI FI, coffee maker but no fridge or microwave. The breakfast was very good and there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance. There's a bus stop opposite the hotel where 75 cents gets you to old San Juan and the beach is a 5 minute walk away. Overall, very nice with no problems encountered.
77. We stayed at the Hampton Inn on Isla Verde for 7 nights. The suite was a little smaller than Hampton Inns we've stayed at in the states, but they provided us with two cribs for our baby and toddler and everyone fit fine. The pool was great, we couldve spent our whole vacation there, and only crossed the street to go to the beach once. There is a lot of shopping in walking distance for the needs of a family- Walgreens, grocery stores. The free breakfast at the hotel was wonderful, the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms clean. The nearby airport was very loud though, and the hotel is located on a very busy street.
78. After reading many good reviews, we used Honors points for a free night before a flight back to Texas. This was the best decision we could have made. The front desk staff were all wonderful. When we checked in, we asked for a room with 2 beds rather than one. Not only were we given this change, but we were also upgraded to a suite. The room was immaculate and had every ammenity anyone could want. We used our room towels for the pool & upon heading back to our room, we asked for more towels. The towels arrived immediately after we got to our room. The pool was nice as was the pool swim up bar. We decided to go to Metrapol for dinner (good choice) but we were told by 3 other guests that the hamburgers were the best they had ever had....no exceptions. One guest said that he had been there 3 days and had eaten hamburgers at the pool bar 4 times! We heard a plane when we were in the pool. It did require that we stop our conversation for about 15 to 20 seconds. We did not consider this a major inconvenience. We never heard anything when we were in our room.
79. Stayed at the Hampton Inn one night pre-boarding Royal Caribbean. Quick $10 cab ride (+ $1/bag) to hotel. Then $19 cab ride to Pan American pier. Dropped our bags off at ship and took another cab to Old San Juan for $15. Wish we had more time in San Juan to visit more attractions. Cabs are zoned and accessible
80. My boyfriend and I booked the Hampton Inn for 2 nights pre-cruise. We were very happy with this hotel. The price was much cheaper than most other hotels in the area. Though the area is expensive as a whole. The hotel was clean, the bed was very comfortable, the breakfast was better than adequate, the pool bar area & grill were very nice also. The burgers are huge and juicy. We walked about a block or 2 to Isla Verde beach which was very nice. We also took the bus into Old San Juan. You catch it out front for .75 cents. I would not suggest it. Pay the extra money and take the cab. The bus was packed wall to wall people and the driver had people flying all over the place because he drove crazy. It also took triple the time as the cab ride home. We waited at least 30-40 minutes for the bus to pick us up also and the locals told us that is the norm because the drivers get paid either way so have no incentive to be on time. We did not have any problems with air conditioning in our room. Ours worked very well. It was freezing in the room. We also had no problems getting pool towels. They had an area at the pool whee u get get towels/dispose of towels. The grill outside does run out of things (certain beer,etc) but we just chose something else then. All in all we had a very good time here and would stay at the Hampton Inn again.
81. The location of this hotel is very good (assuming you have a car) and parking is $5.00/night which is very good. However, the rooms are worn down and not very clean. The sheets look old and with stains. It has a free breakfast, but it is clearly food that is tailored to the American tourist (e.g. Bagel with cheese/bacon/pizza souce on top, Muffins, etc... (thought it had fruits, which was good). In general, this hotel it's simply too expensive for what it is.
82. I have stayed at many Hilton-owned San Juan Hotels and I was so pleased to find that this Hilton run Hampton Inn has the same high Hilton standards. Wonderful staff, clean rooms, plentiful breakfast and most of all, a really nice crowd of people! I love that this is a non-Casino hotel, but there are many casino's nearby if that's your thing. I found it easy to take the bus to/from Old San Juan from here and it's literally across the street from the beach but their pool was a quiet beautiful spot. I will definitely return!!! Book a room here without hesitation, you'll be pleased! Thank you Front Desk, Bell staff, Housekeeping and Breakfast staff --you are really doing a great job!! !
83. I stayed here several times. It is far the best hotel in the Isla Verde area. The airport is right behind the hotel. The only blemish. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is really good. I will absouletly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in the San Juan
84. Would definitely stay here again. Great linens and bed! You can eat your complimentary (nice, large selection of items) breakfast outside by the pool if you like. Fairly expensive, but all the hotels are. A selection of restaurants within a few blocks that you can walk to. Good beach also within walking distance. You can walk to a bustop that will take you to Old San Juan (about 45 minutes) for $.75 exact change. Taxi to airport was about $16.00+ - seem to have a standard rate, same each way.
85. We were able to get a great rate on a king suite back in November. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The room had two HDTVs and separate sleeping and living/dining areas. Parking was free since the gate was malfunctioning. Breakfast was okay, but was for gringos. Our only real incident was that or toilet got backed up one afternoon, but maintenance and housekeeping dealt with it right away.
86. The staff at the hotel was great! Anytime we needed directions or suggestions they were happy to help. The room was clean and updated, more then we expected. The breakfast every morning was definitly a plus. Safe and fun. Will definitly stay agian.
87. Our room had a water leak and they moved us down the hall.The breakfast was OK but on the way back to room, a large roach crossed in front of me.The location was good but it rained and the water flooded the exit of parking lot.Pool was very small,no hot tub.
88. This is a nice hotel and is currently undergoing some renovation/improvements (as of 10/2011) so it should be even nicer, BUT that won't change the fact that this hotel is in a strange, cramped, and less than "resort like" neighborhood. Right next to a cock fighting arena, it is difficult to see unless you know exactly what you are looking for. I had gone to the Hampton website numerous times before our trip, but when driving in the neighborhood of the hotel I missed it twice while driving right past it. The hotel does not offer a shuttle so you will pay $10 for a taxi from the airport. The breakfast was great. The pool is nice but VERY busy.
89. Visited San Juan this past weekend and I must say that this hotel is awesome. It was very clean, affordable, attractive and the staff was professional. Room was nicely decorated, always filled with fresh towels and linen. The bed was sooooo comfy!!! The pool bar is the best. The price of food and drinks at the poolside bar is definetely affordable and great. (Try the grilled chicken breast and the prime ribs). The computer lab is clean, nice and free with internet. The staff was always attentive to every need, friendly and professional. It is centrally convienient to restarants, walgreens, a supermarket, casino's and most all 2 blocks away from the beach!!!! The breakfast was not the greatest, but was ok. Consider Dennys for breakfast which is located across the street on the second day of your stay or wait until lunch time and get food at the pool bar... The only thing i would recommend is The walls in the bedrooms just need a lil touch up with painting. Improve the breakfast choices.
90. Recently stayed here for a week, and had a very good time. We arrived early in the morning, and they were very accommodating, letting us check in early. We had a suite with a king bed, and it was very comfortable, had very good sleeps. Every time we went down to the front desk to ask about a restaurant or something, they were very helpful and sure to make sure we had everything we needed.The continental breakfast was good too. Overall we had an excellent stay! !
91. We stayed at this Hotel after we came back from our cruise and this place was very nice. When we got there the rooms were not ready (2 rooms) but it wasn't a very long wait for our rooms. While we waited they stored our luggage for us and told us we could use all the facilities, pool etc. It has a beautiful pool area with a swim up pool bar & grill you can eat at. The prices were a bit high but the food was good. The rooms were nice, clean and fresh. The staff was very friendly and helpful. This Hotel is across the street from the beach but you just have to walk across the street to the beach and it is handy to the airport, just a few minutes away. There is a Walgreens across the street and just up the street of course is Chili's. Very good place to eat. The Hampton has a continental breakfast but we didn't get a chance to try it because our flight left early in the morning. All in all this was a nice place and I would definitly stay there again. Wish we had booked here before the cruise instead of the ESJ.
92. I stayed at the Hampton inn for 7 nights & I loved it! It was nice, quite, & relaxing. The hotel was VERY clean & the rooms were huge. The hotel is positioned in a good spot on the strip so you can walk to different local places. As for the airport noise, you only hear it by the pool & not in your room..BUT you will hear that same noise at any other hotel on that same strip! Trust me, I went visited other hotels. Bottom line, stay here! The food is good, the staff are nice & accomadating, & it's a lovely place. I will stay there again.
93. Stay at the Hampton Inn for 4 days and 3 nights. My husband and I went to PR for his 30th birthday. Arrived at the airport 1 hour before the Hotel staff kindly allowed us to check-in early. The Hotel is modern and I think the the atomosphere is very relaxing. The hallway on the floor that we stayed on was never loud it was quiet. Breakfast was excellent and the staff their made sure your needs were met at breakfast time. The pool and hot tub are clean and fun. Towel were provided in the pool area. The beach is a short walk away. DO NOT get a rental car because everything is nearby. The bus is safe and it cost $0.75 to get to Old San Juan and $0.75 back. Very cheap compared to $20 the taxi cost one way. The Casino was modest size and I got luck while there. The night club with the EL San Juan Hotel and Casino is upscale and very nice $20 to get in. Prefect location everything is withing walking distance. Will only stay at this Hampton Inn Next time I travel.
94. On arrival, we were warmly welcomed by Naomi at the Front Desk, who was very attentive and helpful. She quickly browsed the system and offered us two options for accommodation and gave a summary of an excellent special that was currently on for the King room which had a sitting area as well. Excellent upsell because the room was very spacious and clean for just an additional US$10. Naomi knew her stuff - in both English and Spanish! The facilities were very well kept and the Housekeeping was outstanding. The room was ready right away, which is always a plus. The complimentary breakfast was good and other bonuses like newspapers were readily available. It would be an excellent choice for business travellers, but is equally suitable for couples and families. Excellent surroundings, helpful and well-informed team members and good location make this hotel an excellent choice in Puerto Rico.
95. Three friends & myself stayed for 1 comfortable night prior to our Princess Cruise. The staff were very friendly & helpful. The location is excellent . Across the road is a pharmacy , grocery shop & a couple of blocks away is the beach although the pool was just fine. We enjoyed a typical Puerto Rican & reasonably priced meal restaurant in a strip mall across from the extremely expensive Intercontinental Hotel . Then we went next door to our restaurant for Ice Cream. The queen beds were definitely comfortable & we slept well .
96. Hotel stay was good till a storm came which knocked out the cable and forced me, my wife and 7 month old son to stay in the room and do nothing, not even internet, they say high speed online but your better off not even using it. Was forced to go to the hotel up the street were family was staying (by the way they had no problems during the 3 day storm, cough cough Embassy Suits), so we could actually keep track of the wether (found out a tornado had passed threw). On the 3rd day (today) with no cable or "internet" I asked if we could be compensated at all, their answer was they have dvd's. I know no one wants a storm to pass through and mess things up, but come on are you really not going to compensate me paying $130 a night for half a room, take some money off at lease. But thats ok I'll be calling the higher ups in the morning.
97. My family stayed overnight before our cruise the next day. This hotel is bigger than the usual Hampton Inns we have here in mainland. The lobby is spacious. And the staff were smiling and willing to help. The room I chose was the suite since there were 3 of us. I was suprised when we entered as the room looked like that of the Embassy Suites. It was just refreshing. The casinos, Walgreens, and restaurants are just across the street. The neighborhood was safe to walk around 9 pm. It is very close to the airport. But there is no shuttle service. I like this hotel and I don't mind coming back.
98. I was really surprised. This is not your ordinary Hampton Inn. For instance, there's a big pool, with a pool side bar and grill (open to at least 21:00). They serve real drinks, and grill big burgers, skirt steaks, and prepare other full meals. The place seemed more like a small resort than a "room only" hotel. This Hampton is located on a good street, with lots of outside restaurants and bars, all within walking distance. It's close to the airport as well. I would be happy using this hotel for a longer stay.
99. We flew from Vieques to San Juan the day before our flight home to the US and stayed in the Hampton Inn while in San Juan. The hotel was great!! The room was clean and comfy, the breakfast and dining area was lovely and the pool was fantastic! Also having the pool bar and grill was a nice relaxing end to our vacation before an early flight home the next day. It is close to SJU airport so you do hear the planes when outside but not from the rooms. I slept great! Also is very close to everything so we walked to dinner and around downtown. Will absolutely stay here again.
100. Our family stayed here pre-cruise and post-cruise. It was quite convenient and close to the airport and port. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast had a lot of choices, as are Hampton Inn breakfasts. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and well maintained. The pool area is nice. I used the business center, has updated computers and free use of the printers which I used to print boarding passes. However, I was very disappointed with the rooms, they were not clean, dark and had a musty odor. The bathrooms were not clean as one would expect. We stayed in a suite and the wet bar area was very unclean. The tiles on the bathroom had mold. I felt disgusted while showering. Both times I stayed there, I felt the same way. The airplane noise was not a problem, could not hear it in the rooms. I was very disappointed with this Hampton Inn solely due to the accommodations, after all that is the most important part of the stay. I will not stay there again. If you are looking for a pre-cruise stay I suggest you stay in Old Town San Juan. The beach across the hotel and down a street was nothing to write home about.
