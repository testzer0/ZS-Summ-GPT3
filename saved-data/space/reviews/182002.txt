1. The Primrose is a good hotel for people who plan on staying just a few dates in Toronto and plan on only sleeping there. I stayed there for one night with three friends. It was in a good location on Carlton/College Ave. It was only a few blocks east of Yonge St. The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV. The room are clean. The bathroom needed a little work but it was good enough for my needs. The non-free continental breakfast is a joke. I would just find breakfast somewhere else. In all, I would stay there again if I plan on going to Toronto to have fun.
2. My stay was for three days at the Primrose and I found it to be a fine hotel. I attempted to stay there on a subsequent visit to Toronto but found it fully booked unfortunately. For my next visit to Toronto I would hope to be able to stay at the Primrose again. The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage. I instead parked a block away because the garage was full upon my checking in. Other than that I had a pleasurable stay. I would suggest this hotel if coming to visit the Church Street Village for nightlife and if you wish to visit the rest of the city a subway station is within easy walking distance. The staff were friendly, helpful and the view of the Toronto skyline I had from my room was great.
3. Came for 1 night to see a concert and stayed at the Primrose Hotel since it was close to the club. Was a good stay. Room was clean and quite and the bed was really confortable. Loved the Tim Hortons in the Lobby the next morning. Would stay there again as price was great and location perfect.
4. Had a stop over for the night in Toronto and instead of staying at the airport where there is nothing to do, decided to go downtown and look around. Got a room without a reservation at the Primrose Hotel which was right beside an underground train stop. The price was good and they had a room with a king bed open. The place was in a good location and I was able to walk to a huge mall and what I guess is Torontoâ€™s equivalent of Times Square. There was a great Thai restaurant too called Jasmine Gardenâ€™s if anyone out there is into Thai food. Staff was friendly and room was good. Large for downtown (what I would call a suite if I was staying in NYC). There is also a coffee shop in the lobby which was open late so that was convenient. Was able to get a taxi back to the airport the next morning no problem. Would like to spend more time in the city, and when I do decide to go back would check back with hotel to see if they have rooms.
5. My experience at this hotel was the worst I've ever experience within the service industry. It is obvious that Customer Service is not a priority for this hotel. All they want is money. The front desk is rude and inexperienced. Being from out of town, we drove to Toronto to spend a nice week-end. The first impression we got from the Primrose Best Western was rudeness. Before checking in, they rudely told us that the parking space we had requested had been given to someone else and that we were to go down the street to public parking lot. THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS. When we tried to call them asking for clarification as they had given us wrong directions, the women on the phone began yelling at us, denying that they gave us wrong directions and continuously transferred our call. It took 10 minutes before another hotel representative came on to give us proper directions. We were lost in a city we HAD never been in for 10 mintues during the night. Then came the room. We specficially asked for a king size bed with no kitchenette. When we got to our room, we got 2 separate beds and a kitchentte. What made it worse was we asked for a non-smoking floor and throughout the whole week-end all we could smell was cigarette smoke. They NEVER once apologized for their mix-ups and behaviours. I cannot begin to explain how awful this hotel is. It may be cheaper than other hotels, but the abuse you experience is not worth it. In my entire life, I have never been treated in such a rude, disrespecting manner. I would not reccomend this place to even my worst ennemies.
6. Don't stay at this hotel unless you like slow (and possibly unsafe) elevators, flaky wireless Internet, and poor customer service. The elevators are extremely slow, sometimes taking 5 minutes just to get an elevator if you are on an upper floor. And if that elevator is full then good luck waiting for another. It shouldn't be too bad if you're on a lower floor and you like taking the stairs. You might also get stuck in the elevator, though the manager said that it happens all the time. And if you're lucky the alarm button in the elevator will have been fixed by then. The wireless Internet, while free, is not even worth that price. It was built using cheap consumer-grade access points instead of business grade ones that are more reliable and can be centrally managed. You'll get on for a couple minutes and then it will flake out and you'll spend the next 10 minutes trying to reconnect. The manager, Jeff, needs to learn a thing or two about customer service. When I complained about the elevators and wireless he just stood there with no apology or good explanation other than it would be too expensive to fix the elevators and it was all the guests' fault anyway for the elevator getting stuck since there were 8 people in the elevator (it's rated for 12 people). And when Rowena at the front desk gave us the wrong room (a double room instead of the king we had reserved 6 months before) the first thing she said when we immediately came back down was "did you take anything out of the room?" as if we were going steal the shampoo bottles. She kept asking us this for some reason and changed us to a king room without even an apology for the wrong room. You should also be aware that there are no fire sprinklers in the guest areas of the hotel. This is especially important now that they are installing kitchenettes in some of the rooms.
7. Stayed here for weekend away to Toronto with wife and 13 yr old daughter. Drop off point for luggage check in is pretty small so if anyone is in front of you good luck accessing the hotel front door. We waited 25 minutes for a car to move and had to find management to clear it so we could proceed! The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot! It was full when I got there and had to get a "pass" to park in the employees parking lot in the back alley! This cost $15 a night! The staff member at the desk told us there were "other options" if we didnt want to pay the fee; but didnt let us in on the secret as to where they might be! The laundry left something to be desired. A pillow case had a blood stain on it(I think! ), and the the bath towels had yellow stains and smelled "funky"! There was popcorn on the room floor when we arrived? Bath tub water kept leaking out when trying to have a bath. The front desk person was very abrupt and had a serious attitude problem. The room itself was "OK" and the only redeeming factor was the location; which is within walking distance of all major attractions. I would not stay there again.
8. We chose to stay here because our daughter was staying in the student accommodation here as well. It's only a two and a half star hotel so you can't expect all the luxuries of a 4 or 5 star and as a result it was well priced. The room had 2 double beds and was reasonably spacious. No fridge or electric jug but I think that is normal for a standard room in any hotel in North America. The beds were comfortable and the sheets good quality but the furniture is pretty dated and the bathroom very tired looking. It did have nice white towels and a good selection of toiletries. A four cup coffee maker and supplies and complementary wi-fi were useful. Â The carpet wasn't as well vacuumed as one would expect with the corners and edges not done for a while. The window looking at a fantastic view north was so grimy it was hard to see through (finger and nose prints all over it) We just kept the net curtains closed so we couldn't see them and enjoyed the night lights instead. We didn't complain as we had already made ourselves at home & strewn all our belongings around the room and it would have been a bother to move. The location is good being a short walk into town and is close to the new Loblaws food emporium at Maple Leaf Gardens.
9. My wife and I recently took a trip to Toronto for our 35th wedding anniversary and booked in at the Primrose Hotel. It was close to the theatre we were going to and the price was affordable. We were extremely impressed with both the hotel and the service. We mentioned on check in that it was our anniversary and were immediately upgraded from our room with 1 double to a king room on the highest floor with a wonderful view of the city. They were also kind enough to recommend and make reservations at a lovely restaurant called Ruth Chris (pricey but well worth it if you are a steak lover). The hotel was in a great location and we walked to a charming area called Yorkville. The room itself was very spacious and clean. I saw some work being done in the lobby and wonder if they also did the rooms as our furniture looked to be new and had no damage or wear you normally see. The only issue I did not like was that the fan in the bathroom automatically turns on when you turn on the light, and usually my wife likes to sleep with the bathroom light on, but we didnâ€™t as the fan would be running. Other than that, we were most pleased with the hotel and hope to return again on our 40th.
10. I recently went to Toronto and reserved into the Primrose Best Western Hotel on Carlton St. I was given a discount as I was a senior so the price ended up being very reasonable. The hotel was in a good location and was close to restaurants and a wonderful greenhouse which I toured for an entire afternoon. The ladies at the reception desk were very pleasant and always smiling and very helpful in giving us directions. The room I was given had 1 bed and a small sitting area. It was very clean and comfortable and had very nice artwork on the walls. I did have breakfast in the morning in the restaurant beside the lobby area and was pleased with the level of service from the waiter and while he did make a small mistake on my order (he gave me potatoes when I asked for no potatoes), it was quickly rectified, and he continued to provide attentive service. My only complaint would have been that they have a lovely grand piano in the lobby and while I was trying to enjoy my breakfast there was a child playing around on it. I was impressed however that after voicing my concerns, the manager spoke with the parents and the child stopped playing. My stay was a pleasant one, and I would not hesitate to call them for a seniorâ€™s rate again when I next need a place to stay. We really liked this hotel!
11. Went to the Primrose with my g/f for a romantic getaway and stayed at the Primrose Hotel since it was close to the restaurant and theatre. Was a nice place. Got a room on the 22nd floor with 1 king bed and a great view. The room was nice, although I wish they had room service. They even were able to get some roses put in the room before we arrived as a surprise. The staff were really cool and the place was in a good location. We didnâ€™t use the restaurant as there was a place next door which served an all day breakfast for cheap so we slept in and went there one morning. Pool was good â€“ it was outside so able to get some sun tanning in too. It was a great weekend and my g/f was really surprised. I would probably go back again. Nice Hotel.
12. After much searching for a decent hotel at a cheap rate in downtown Toronto, we finally settled on the Primrose Hotel. From the map it looked like it was pretty much in the middle of the downtown area and the rate was cheaper than some of the other hotels. I guess in general we were pleased with the stay. The rooms were large and clean which was all we really needed. They had a restaurant but we didnâ€™t use it and opted for a quick coffee and muffin at the coffee shop beside the lobby. The staff were nice and helpful. We didnâ€™t run into any problems at the hotel, but unfortunately our trip ended on a sour note as my wifeâ€™s wallet was pickpocketed while we were outside the CN Tower. A tip to all travelers â€“ doesnâ€™t matter where you go or where you stay, there are people out there who are thieves..any traveling we will do now will ensure that our valuables are left in the hotel safe and we wear a money belt. I am thankful however to the manager of the hotel, who when he heard our plight, assisted us with contacting the local police and filing a report.
13. I stayed here for one night to watch the Rogers Cup. First impression, it was in a decent area, not too far from the central part of downtown with all the restaurants and I thought ok, not too bad. We then checked in and were told that the parking garage was full and that I could park on the street. For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not. Finally, we came back to the hotel at around midnight after seeing the tennis match and having dinner and come to find out that there were hookers on almost every corner surrounding the hotel. After circling the hotel trying to find a parking spot which I eventually did about 1/4 mile from the hotel (on the street), a bum waited in front of my car asking for money. Also, when I booked the hotel I was told that there were only smoking rooms left which was fine because I too smoke, but the smell was almost unbearable. It could have been febreezed, at least. For the price of this hotel, I would imagine a much nicer place in a better area. I do not recommend staying here.
14. My daughter and I just returned from a weekend in Toronto and stayed at the Primrose. i was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews but we were very pleased with the hotel. The rooms were very updated and the beds were very comfortable! we stayed on the 15th floor but accidentally went to the 18 floor one day and it was stinky! : smoking floor. As far as the location goes, it was close to everything with maybe a couple of extra short blocks of walking which we didn't mind at all. we did see a couple of homeless guys but they did not bother us. we were joking about not seeing the 'ladies of the night' that we had read about but that was because we were in so early. we did get a craving for some calamari at 12:30 at night so we went out for a walk and saw three girls of the night between our hotel over to Younge. not a big deal. i did not feel threatened at all because of the 'shady area' which was mentioned in some reviews. the subway is just up the street . Bankok Garden on Elm st. is wonderful for Thai. the girl who checked us in was very nice but there was a cranky woman on the next day. the concierge had little knowlege of the restaurants which should be a big part of his job but we made out ok. there are so many wonderful restaurants in toronto including a Korean Grill we went to where you bbq your own meat/fish. it is right on Younge down near Dundas. we will definitely stay here again considering we saved around $100 a night compared to the Delta which we tried to get into but was booked.
15. My latest trip to Toronto my office booked me into the primrose hotel which was close to the meeting I had to attend. I was pleased with the hotel in general and it had all the amenities I needed. The staff were pleasant and assisted in getting taxis for me when needed. Only small issue was when I went to iron my pants the iron was broken. It was quickley rectified and someone brought me a new iron within minuets. The two main things I did apprieciate was, the free wireless internet, and the fact there was a Tim hortons right in the lobby. Many places I visit charge ridicules rates for internet so the fact it was free was great. Connection was fast and I had no issues. It was a nice hotel and I will stay here again. Thanks.
16. As other reviewers are saying, the place needs a facelift fast. Some hospitality training for the staff wouldn't be too much to ask either. A couple of my friends and I stayed there for a weekend of fun and it was awful from the start. Mind you, we were all college age guys, not too concerned about what the place looked like. But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it. The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner). Reading some of the good reviews posted it seems we stayed at different hotels. But if you're thinking of staying at this one, pass it up.
17. Our room was good, the bed very good - but it was disappointing to find that the "new and exciting Primrose Restaurant and Bar where no expense had been spared" (according to their brochure) was CLOSED except for breakfast time. It was the middle of winter with temperatures around minus-10 to minus-20 degrees and we had to trudge the streets to find places to eat. The Wi-Fi service in the room was undependable, the 40+ kgb reception would suddenly drop to 1Kgb and unuseable, then it would flip up to perhaps 18 kbs and back to 1 kgb. Very frustrating. However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!
18. I Stayed at the BW Primrose in early october. Stayed in a king bed room on the 17th floor. Room was large and clean, bathroom was nice, looks like it was newly renovated. Our room had a south view of the city with a fantistic view of downtown and the lake. The staff was really nice and helpful and directed me to the nearest tourist attractions. The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there. The Internet was complimentary(wireless) made it convienent to check my email from my room. Overall, a great place to stay because the rooms were clean, staff was friendly and helpful, many attractions and great restaurants are walking distance from the hotel. If your looking to come to Toronto leave the Car at home. The Hotel is in walking distance to most major attractions and the public transportation is easily accessible.
19. The yearly family vacation happened in Toronto this time. My wife and I really enjoy this time we have to spend with the kids while they still think these trips are "cool". We have used Best Western before once on a trip to Michigan and had a miserable stay so very reluctantly we booked the Primrose. The staff at checkin was quick to notice our children were a little fussy and provided crayons and coloring books that calmed them right down, The room was huge complete with microwave and small fridge so we could warm up left over which is always important travelling with kids. Overall we were very pleased with the quality of the hotel and the service. We recommened this hotel for families and we will certainly be coming back. The coffee shop Tim Hortons in the lobby has wonderful baked goods not good for the wasteline buttasted great, Thanks Primrose.
20. I/we have stayed at the Primrose Hotel 2 â€“ 3 times. We choose the hotel for its proximity to the Gay Village in Toronto (Church and Wellesley area). It is handy to shopping and night life â€“ but so are many other hotels from which to choose. Each time weâ€™ve stayed I have always had the impression that the place needs a good cleaning. It was a little worn down at the edges and maybe has undergone a serious facelift since last we were there. Lord knows that it needed to be done. It appeared to be a well managed facility. Several of the rooms appeared to be rented by students, either from Ryerson or the National Ballet School, both of which are very close. The one good thing that came about from our stays at this hotel was finding The Golden Greek Restaurant which is in the lower part of the building next door. It is a small, friendly, family own/operated business. This restaurant has a loyal group of customers. As someone who visits maybe once every year they remember you â€“ canâ€™t beat that for customer service. The food they serve is good as well. As Iâ€™ve said in the past of other facilities, if you compare this hotel to others of similar value in the same general area, you would choose another establishment. We tried this hotel and will pass on it in the future.
21. So this family vacation was a short stop in Toronto and then onto Niagara falls. We stayed in Toronto at the Primrose hotel which was great cuz it was right downtown. The kids had a blast in the pool and the lifeguard there was amazing. The hotel has everything we needed and the room was clean and large for the family. The restaurant was also a great deal since our kids ate free from the buffet since they are younger. Hotel also was able to give us a crib for the 2 year old which was good as my wife was worried he would fall out of bed. Was a great start to our mini vacation and looking forward now to seeing the falls.
22. I just want to add my comments here. I was just on a business trip and because of circumstances had to stay at the Primrose for one night before I came back to the States. It was gay pride week so very few rooms were available and I had to take a smoking room here at this God-awful place. I've stayed in many places around the world but this was the worst. You felt as if you needed a shower just being in the hotel. It is very worn and in a terrible area of town. Nothing in the room felt clean and I agree with one reviewer that the bed "crunched". I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump. Heed this warning stay away from this crappy place, you'll be glad you did.
23. Our church group recently stayed at the Primrose Hotel. We had chosen this hotel as it was downtown and they were able to give us a discounted group rate as we had 17 rooms in total. Everything went very smoothly. All the guests were checked- in in advance so no one had to line up at the front desk. The doorman assisted everyone with their luggage and picked it up when we left and brought it to the bus. The group in general was pleased with the rooms. We had a mixture of rooms with 1 bed and some with 2 beds. The service was great and we had a breakfast arranged in a private dining room which everyone enjoyed. I was pleased with the service I received from the staff both when arranging the tour and during the stay. We plan to make this an annual trip and will check back first with the Primrose before looking elsewhere for rooms.
24. On the way up to my room - I got stuck in an elevator. This was a good indication of how my stay was going to be at the hotel. The rooms are old, the bathroom smelled, we had a view of air conditioners and the gym was a joke. No working treadmills and a couple of out of date machines. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!
25. My travels landed me in Toronto and I booked in at the Primrose Best Western hotel. It is in a great location and was able to walk to some great restaurants and shopping places. The room was great, and I was given room 1705 which had a king bed and a fantastic view. It was really clean, and the housekeeping lady was very friendly and always asking if I needed any additional toiletries or coffee. The front desk staff were superb and went out of their way to help with one girl at the front desk loaning me her personal umbrella so I could go to the shops without getting soaked. The price was great, and the rooms large. This place is a definite choice when I return to the city.
26. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever with a hotel room that cost $160 a night. The elevators were very scary and one was constantly being repaired. When at the restaurant, they gave me catchup that was so rancid it bubbled. There was brown stuff on the walls of the bathroom, and the room was very shabby. It was either too hot or too cold. For $10 extra I could have stayed at the Sheraton!
27. So we went to Toronto for some girl time and had a fantabulous time. We got 2 rooms at the Primrose Hotel as they were able to give us rooms with a connecting door. We spent the whole weekend shopping, clubbing and eating. The hotel was totally cool. The people who work there are great and seem to know all the cool places to hang out at. The room was wickedly huge and we had tons of space. The maid lady was also super nice and gave us extras of everything like towels, shampoo and soaps and stuff. Was an amazing time and absolutely LOVE Toronto.
28. I Stayed here for 11 nights in July 2011 with my boyfriend. We had previously booked a guesthouse which turned out to be awful so we where in a bit of a panic to get somewhere nice and affordable. The lady in reception was very helpful and kind, she got us a very good room at a reasonable price. We got a room on the 16th floor with great views of the city , Our room had a big comfortable double bed. Tv,mircowave, fridge,cooker,coffee maker, climate control,couch desk ,hairdryer and toiletries and wi fi access. Everyday Our bed was made up with fresh sheets ,the was rubbish emptied and clean towels were provided. There was also a business room where you could enjoy free internet and use of the fax and printer. Also to our delight there was a fitness centre, swimming pool and a sauna. The hotel had very alert security staff also there was a safety deposit boxes behind reception to keep your valuables safe . We have never been to Canada before or to a huge city like Toronto, we found it very easy to get around, Primrose hotel is an excellent location as the subway is only 5min walk way .There is a lot of restaurants , bars, stores ,drugmarts and shops within walking distance also Dundas sq , Eaton centre &hockey Hall of Fame are close by. Whenever we wanted to go somewhere and were'nt sure the consirge in the hotel would tell us how and provided handy little maps. All in all I would definately recommend this hotel. If I ever return to Toronto I will be staying there again. In a nutshell it was affordable clean comfortable, the staff where friendly .. we felt safe here and the stay was very pleasant!
29. The day before I checked in to this Best Western I read the reviews on here and freaked out! I was actually scared to the point I told my boss I didn't want to stay there. I would have switched hotels but a co-worker was already there. When I checked in I didn't see anything that put me off that much? Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!). I did notice the elevators seemed dated and in need of an update, but given that I was on high alert, this wasn't a big deal. When I got to my room I was impressed. Large room, with really nice and comfy duvets, and overall much nicer than I've seen from most hotels in Toronto in this price range. Room and furnishings were in good shape and overall I was very impressed given I was expecting a horror show. Housekeeping and front desk staff were all very nice and friendly. Found my room and the hotel in general very clean and well kept. Hotel has free wireless internet that I used in my room and in the Lobby that worked well. The hotel is was a 15min. walk to the Eaton Center. One of the nicest Best Western's I've been to. I'll be back. Took some pics on my cam phone of our two rooms and the lobby.
30. I stayed at the Primrose last weekend with a buddy for the Grey Cup and had a blast. The hotel was great and the people at the front desk were awesome. We were a little late getting up after the game and they let us stay longer past check out time without getting charged extra. The room was alot bigger then most hotels i have stayed in and I liked the fact that they had duvets instead of the typical stiff sheets most places do. The parking garage was a little tight to drive around in, but other than that, I would definately go back for another weekend with the guys. Everyone was really nice and helpful when we needed to get directions. Overall it was a great experience.
31. I was booked in here as part of a city break package, while visiting friends in the Toronto area. On checking in, I found that my reservation had been cancelled as my flight had been delayed for 24 hrs due to bad weather in Amsterdam. An annoyance rather than trouble really. I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous. The staff were very friendly & efficient, & sorted the booking problem immediately. I was surprised to find that the area itself was a bit seedy. There were several `ladies of indeterminate occupation` on duty outside the front door most of the day & night. However, they were very pleasant & always said hello whenever I passed! The room was a pleasant surprise, considering it was a budget hotel. Big, clean, with 2 large double beds. The view was great. I`ve never been on the 18th floor of anywhere before. Considering that a lot of rooms are let out to students, it was pretty quiet. My mate came into town on my last night & there was no extra charge for the room share, which was cool. The only gripe I had really, was that the bar shut very early & we couldn`t get a beer when we returned after our night on the town. The `Tim Horton`s` coffee shop in the reception was a bonus. great coffee & doughnuts in the mornings! The general location was very close to the downtown area. great for shopping, dining & partying. I was surprised to find what amounted to an underground shopping city that stretched all the way down to the waterfront. If I was going back, I`d definitely stay here again.
32. East Lothian Scotland. We stayed here for 6 nights.Before we arrived we read previous reviews and were a bit apprehensive. However on arriving found the hotel room to be very spacious, clean and very comfortable. We were on the 22nd floor and the view was to die for. The maid came in everyday to clean and leave fresh towels. There was also always plenty of hot water for Baths/showers. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Also the hotel was in a very good location for all attractions.
33. Never seem to have luck when traveling with the kids at hotels. Usually there is some issue which leads to either screaming kids or hassles during the stay. Last weekendâ€™s trip to Toronto seemed to have broken my run of bad luck. We booked in at the Primrose Best Western Hotel after finding a decent rate online. The check in process was quick which was appreciated when the kids were tired and cranky from driving. The room was great and large with 2 queen beds. While the room didnâ€™t have a fridge in it which I thought was pretty standard for a hotel, they did send one up for us and install it so we could store some stuff for the kids. Our time there was good and we didnâ€™t run into any problems which was a first for us!. Was a good trip, especially our visit to the Hockey Hall of Fame (definitely the place to go if you have sons who live and breathe hockey) and the staff were great. Gets my vote for the next trip we take to Toronto.
34. While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went. From the time we got our parking permit until the time we checked out we had nothing but polite staff. The parking attendant was pleasant, the check in went smoothly,the room and the view was terrific. The sheets and the bathroom were impeccable and the stay was great. The restaurant buffet for breakfast was good, the wait staff was very pleasant. At check out the couple ahead of me had a bad experience with the management but the young fellow at the desk handled it with such grace that I wanted to applaud him. Everything on our bill was as it should be and the checkout went smoothly. It's not in the best part of Toronto but for the price and amenities it was a great value. My family has said that we should return at some other time.
35. I got this reservation off ratestogo.com, for last minute hotel deals. I got it for 90$CAN, so already I was pretty happy for Downtown Toronto. The rooms were great, we were on the 6th floor, beds were comfortable and room was quite clean. Windows opened and we were two smokers so it cleared the air. Walking distance to the Blue Jays game (25 min.). All in all, I`d highly recommend it to anyone looking to catch a baseball weekend, or shop at the Eaton Center and such.
36. the hotel is centrally located and is very comfortable with a nice bed and rooms cleaned daily. The hotel however seems to be ageing with the air con unit making a loud grinding noise and shower water sometimes talking hours to drain from the bath tub due to a blockage. Overall, not perfect but good value for money. would stay again.
37. This was certainly not the greatest hotel I have ever stayed in. I picked it because it was three stars, had internet access, and was stumbling distance from the concert two of us were attending. I booked a single room with two beds for the four of us and it was acceptable. Well, with the exception of the bathroom. It was small and not very clean. The staff were rude and quite useless, they just seemed annoyed and unwilling to help no matter how polite we were. Which made it easy to stumble through the lobby drunk and singing at 1:00 a.m. There was a 'restaurant' that never did open the three days, two nights we stayed and no room service. None of the 'perks' of the hotel were available-pool, steam room, gym, and the TV was old and hardly worked. The room we payed for with internet access, didn't have internet access. They at least lent us an external wifi card but it still didn't work. And they never did give us any form of refund for that either. There were 'ladies of the night' out front of the hotel, but they were harmless and didn't hassle us at all. I had a great time, as did my other friend. But that was due to the amount of rum we consumed and an amazing concert. I don't feel our two friends enjoyed the stay as much as we did. I would not stay there again.
38. I stayed at the Primrose in Toronto several years ago, on an all-guys expedition to Canada. We found it to be a fine hotel, there were 7 of us total, and we had 2 rooms connected. The rooms were spacious with queen sized beds, nice bathrooms, the view was decent out of our 5th floor rooms, and we had no real issues at all as far as the hotel went. There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach. We found some fun local Canadian girls who showed us around, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The only thing I might mention is the fact that the hotel seems to be located right in the midst of a very prominent gay section of Toronto, and for 7 straight males, some of whom are not particularly tolerant, this could potentially have been problematic. I think everyone of us was taken aback by how open things were in Canada, compared to the States. But it ended up being fine, no issues. Oh I must also add that there is a Tim Horton's donut shop, second only to Dunkin Donuts in quality (although Canadians might argue that point), located right inside the front entrance, so that was a great option for breakfast! All in all, a great place to go for some fun times in Toronto!
39. Played Hotwire roulette and thought that we lost when we were assigned to the Best Western. This hotel was not bad at all, check-in was very quick. The man at the desk even helped us plan out a walk to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Very helpful at the front desk. We were assigned two double beds and told that a King was not available. This is sometimes how hotwire works, so we understand that. The room was very clean and well appointed. Free internet access worked fine, but not fast. Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back. We needed a special hotel key for the parking lot elevator, the one we were given for the elevator did not work, so we had to ask the front desk. The only thing I did not like about this property is the lack of a indoor swimming pool or even a hot tub. Every other hotel in the area in this class level has one. The best western has a seasonal outdoor pool only, which is no good in December.
40. On booking a touring holiday with a well known company I wondered what the various hotels would be like. I can honestly say the Best Western Primrose Hotel, Toronto Downtown was one of the very best I have had the pleasure of staying in. Everything was spotlessly clean and comfortable and the staff were very helpful and polite. I would certainly recommend this hotel to all.
41. We spent a night in Toronto on our way to Montreal and booked in at the Primrose Hotel. We did not have a room reserved and were happy they were able to take us without a reservation. We were pleased with the choice, and the location was perfect. The hotel was close to some of the places we visited (Hockey Hall of Fame the clear winner with the kids). The room was large and had 2 queen beds in it. The staff were very friendly and cheery and the kids also liked the Tim Hortons in the lobby for the donuts. The price was also quite reasonable. The entire hotel was very bright and the rooms were very clean. It was a great last minute choice and would definitely stay there again.
42. I booked the â€œPrimroseâ€� Best Western, downtown Toronto a few days ago for a trip that we had planned. We arrived at 3:00 in the morning, and drove through the night to arrive to the filthiest hotel we have ever seen! Not knowing much about hotels in Toronto, and trusting the name â€œBest Westernâ€�, we decided to save a few dollars and book online. While taking an elevator to our room, we noted the bottom of the elevator was being held together with a piece of plywood. Exhausted, we walked into our room, and experienced the most overwhelming foul smells, I canâ€™t even describe! My husband laughed when he saw the conditions of the bathroom. A bathtub so filthy I wouldnâ€™t dare stand to take a shower. Weâ€™ve travelled to some very poor countries in our lives, but weâ€™ve never seen such dirty conditions! The room was so filthy, we decided to leave, and find another hotel. We didnâ€™t realize that the Primrose Best Western hotel was in the middle of a large prostitution area, until we left and noticed the building was surrounded by dozens of prostitutes. When we arrived at the Hilton (which we really couldnâ€™t afford, but were tired and in desperate need of a clean place to stay), staff noted that â€œThe Primroseâ€� Best Western was know for their bedbugs!!! Sure enough, when we returned to Ottawa, a Google search revealed that they indeed they had bedbug problems years ago!!! I am a nurse from Ottawa, and basic cleanliness is my only must for a hotel. PLEASE, save yourself the bother, spend the extra few dollars, and go to a reputable hotel!!! Please see bedbugs: [--]
43. I had a conference to go to that was in this hotel. We got an excellent rate because we were doing business in the hotel. The room was very large but made for a small bathroom. Very big comfortable bed. There are a lot of students there so it made the elevators very slow at meal times. But all the students I met were very nice and respectful. The underground parking is horribly laid out. We had many people coming for this conference that had scratched their cars or some that cracked their exhaust pipe. I would stay here again but I would park elsewhere.
44. Went to Toronto for a weekend â€œstaycationâ€� and got a cheap room online at the Primrose Hotel. I was happy overall with the hotel and had no real complaints. The staff were friendly and helpful. There was a bit of a wait for the elevators but a group had just checked in, so had to wait a few extra minutes while the 50 plus ppl all went up. No big deal though. The room itself was nice. Had a room with 1 king bed which was comfortable. It was clean, and the housekeeper who came the next morning was friendly. The hotel itself is in a good location. While we werenâ€™t right on the main street (Yonge Street), it was literally only 2 blocks away, and took less then 3 minutes to get there. Lots of good restaurants in the area too. Not a bad place to spend a weekend.
45. We just came back from this hotel. The property was much better then I expected. The staff was very polite, rooms were clean, and the hotel has a great location. We listened to advices from previous reviews and asked for a room on one of the higher floors. We were given a room on the 12th floor with a south view so we had a view of downtown, CN Tower, and Lake Ontario. As I mentioned before, the room was clean. Very comfortable bed, a small kitchenette in the room (coffee maker, microwave oven, and a refrigerator). The location of the hotel is not too far away from the College Subway station. It comes very useful if you don't want to drive in downtown. The station is about 300 yards west of the hotel. Since I metioned driving, I must mention parking in the hotel. By the time we arrived, all parking spots at the hotel were taken. We were advised to park our car about 2 blocks away where there were no "in and out" priviledges. This is why we used subway frequently. Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway. Another inconvenience to us was Tim Hortons located on the hotel premises. This is not to complain about Tim Hortons in any way, but were were dissapointed of the "limited" menu they have had there. We are huge fans of their breakfast menu but there were only a few choices available- very few muffins and bagels. No Breakfast sandwiches for meat lovers like myself. Again, this is in no way to complain about the quality of service or Tim Hortons, just heads up for fellow travellers. The elevators are a little slow as some other reviews indicated. It was not a big problem going up but it took us about 5 minutes or so when we wanted to go down.
46. Recently went to Toronto to meet up with some friends and got a room for cheap at the Primrose hotel. The location was good, right where I needed to be, and the price was great for downtown and I only paid $89 with a corporate discount. The staff were great, and let me check in early (and I mean early as in 10:30am!!!). I was given a room on the 3rd floor since I donâ€™t like elevators very much and it was easy to use the stairs to get to the room. It was a decent sized room and had a desk and a couch in it. It was clean and comfortable. Wouldnâ€™t hesitate to go back there.
47. My friends and I decided to stay at this hotel for two nights because the price was so good. The hotel was dirty. The shower was disgusting and there were marks all over the walls and carpet. The hallways were also very dim and can be scary at night. The elevators took forever! Be prepared to wait at least five minutes, and the doors sensors do not work, which was very annoying. The staff treatment was alright. They weren't that friendly. I had called down to front desk to ask for some extra towels and they were giving me a hard time. We had also asked the concierge for directions to certain areas in Toronto and he wasn't helpful. I guess this hotel would be ok for people who are looking to party. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a nice weekend getaway or a family looking for a vacation. Spend the extra money and stay somewhere clean with friendly service.
48. Location a few blocks from Yonge street where all the shops and restaurants are. Swimming pool only open when lifeguard is there from 10a to 9p. Musty smell, but pretty clean in the room. Hallways dingy, but staff is nice and helpful. Relatively safe neighborhood in the "gay" area, but there were a few crazies walking the streets and some just high on drugs. Several blocks walking to Eaton Center, the shopping mall nearby. Great beef swarma pita sandwiches nearby esp. the one across the street from the "Made in China" chinese restaurant, which was decent cheap eats on it's own! Free soda with meal at "Made in China" and dinner specials from $5.99! Close to CN tower too!
49. Stayed here for one night on business. The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot. If you have a van or larger vehicle forget parking here. The ramps are very steep, the spots are narrow and the driving room is almost non-existent. You have to drive very slow and carefully to make sure you don't damage your car. The elevators are very small, it is cramped with 4 people with luggage. To get to the parking lot from the guest floors you will need to use an access card in the elevators; if you are not quick enough, or your card doesn't work properly, you will find that you are called to another floor. If you get on an elevator that is packed, forget about getting to the card reader. The room rates are high considering the age/look of the hotel.
50. Went to Toronto to celebrate the big 3-0 with some friends and found a room online at the Primrose Hotel. This was my first trip to Toronto so didnâ€™t know what to expect or where anything was. The lady at the front desk was amazing and not only gave me free maps, but also spent a lot of time giving us tips on where the best clubs / bars etc were and even told us how to get on list so we didnâ€™t have to wait in line. The room we had was on the 20th floor and had 2 huge bedsâ€¦..definitely not a standard double bed I am used to in hotel rooms. Room was clean and the lady who cleaned the room was nice enough to give us triple the towels in the room. My suggestion for the hotel though is try to get a room away from the elevator. We were beside the elevator and at one point someone in the elevator kept hitting the alarm button and we could hear it. Weekend was a blast and I LOVE Toronto and cant wait to go back.
51. Had to go to Toronto for a series of training seminars which were being held at the Convention Centre. Had planned to stay at the Royal York since it was across the street, but ended up at the Primrose Hotel since the rate was about $60 cheaper a night. Even with the $20 round trip taxi ride to the meeting and back I still saved money. My other reason for choosing this hotel was the fact that they have free wireless internet access which was much needed. The room itself was very nice and quite large by normal hotel standards. The staff were friendly and helpful in arranging my daily taxis to the convention centre. An added convenience is a Tim Hortonâ€™s in the lobby which opens an hour earlier than their restaurant. I was pleased with my stay overall and would have no reservations in staying again on my next trip.
52. for what this place costs I definitely recommend this hotel. it's clearly aging, but on the plus side, this means large rooms that were impeccably clean on check-in and throughout my week-long stay. i ended up in a two double beds room near the top floor. the beds were fantastic. i slept wonderfully. there's an in-house tim hortons in case you don't want the very affordable breakfast buffet. the pool area is scarily dirty, full with pigeons, so you might want to skip this offering to stay well. the gym is located in two adjacent rooms, and for the price category of this hotel is nothing to complain about. the helpful general manager had broken equipment really repaired over night. i didn't expect this! three cheers to him! cable tv is a nuisance, there's no international news channel to be had (unless you think CNN America is). there's free - and mostly slow but functional - wireless internet access included in the room rate. great stuff, not one of those sneaky hotels that tries to sell you this sort of thing at extortionate rates after you booked. in case you like gay nightlife, church street is just around the corner :). to those folks who complain so bitterly about this hotel... perhaps try the fairmont and pay several times what you paid. i suspect then you'd have reason to complain. to those who compla
53. My husband and I stayed at the hotel the last week in August. We were very pleased with our choice. It's close to the subway and one day we walked to the CN tower - didn't realize it was that close. If you are in good shape, walking will get you to all the downtown attractions. The room was nice and very comfortable. I found the hotel staff very friendly and accomodating. One thing to mention - there are a number of prostitutes that work between the hotel and the subway station, so if you walk home at night you will run across them. But really that was not a big problem, they minded their own business.
54. Regardless of being on the fringes of a very "colorful" community, there was one incident that soured our stay at the Primrose. We accidently left a piece of jewelry in the room. Despite our best efforts to convey how irreplaceable it was, housekeeping claimed not to have seen it. We are heartbroken and will never recommend this hotel to anyone.
55. My wife and I have been staying at the Primrose Hotel for years. Simply put Its a clean, well run hotel, with excellent service at the front desk and very large rooms that look great. We are working people with three kids and we dont have a lot of quality time to spend together so when we get the chance we come to the Primrose and here is why: 1) Our favorite room is reserved without us having to ask for it. 2) Our favorite bottle of wine is waiting for us in the room 3) Reservations are made at our favorite restauraunt 4) Staff know us by our first names 5) My wife gets a birthday email on her birthday 6) The staff truly feels like family TRY THIS hOTEL you wont be disapointed! !
56. I stayed at the Primrose for ten days and I did like the beds as well as the location of the hotel. Just a couple of blocks away from Yonge & Dundas Square. It is a great location to explore the city by foot. The room itself was spacious with a king size bed, a sofa, desk, coffee maker (which I did not use), and a chair. I would describe it as typical Best Western standard 3 star hotel quality, nothing special and no frills. What did bother me though was the cleanliness. I did speak to housekeeping and the reception but the somehow they managed not to get the room clean thoroughly. The dust built up in the bathroom and on the carpet was substantial, seriously dust bunnies. Also which was bothersome was the wifi. It was so slow it was practically useless. I did ask if I just could use maybe a land line but no luck.
57. We were tipped off that the lifts in this hotel are terrible before our arrival as we were on a tour. But we didnt realise they were as bad as they were, on the 3rd time of using them we got stuck!! Afterwards the Manager acknowledged that the lifts are in need of urgent replacement but due to the cost this has yet to be authorised. In the meantime people get stuck very often in seems. Indeed afterwards we saw on many occasions out of order signs on the doors at various times. We never used the lifts again after being moved to a lower floor. Atleast the manger moved us promptly but he's probably used to this request by now. Other than the hotel is OK, but far from great. The rooms are tired with many defects (both my rooms had faults including bulbs out, loose headboard and loose bathroom fittings. Breakfast was fairly average too. PS The hotel is right next to the redlight district too!
58. My wife and I just returned after a 5 day trip to Toronto. We stayed at this hotel throughout our stay in Canada. We got a large room with two double beds and a coffee maker. The best thing about the room was its view. We had a breathtaking view of downtown Toronto second only to the CN Tower view. We arrived late well past the check-in time and were worried about getting a good room. The hotel staff were very courteous and even asked if we needed a smoking or a non smoking room and a room with two double beds or one. We picked a non smoking room with two double beds.There are several restaurants in this area. The College St subway stop is only a few blocks away. Dunbar Sq is within walking distance. Several churches of different denominations are dotted around Allan Park that is across the street. And when you are at the park don't forget to visit the Greenhouse. It is free. For the price we paid for this hotel and the round trip airfare booked through Travelocity, it was a steal. Joe Daniel, New York, NY
59. Recently spent a night in Toronto to do some shopping and stayed overnight at the Primrose Hotel after finding a good price online. Was happy with the hotel overall. The room was good and had a nice view. The location was perfect as I walked to the Eaton Centre which was about 10 minutes away, and then the cab ride back only cost $8 including a tip. Staff were nice, and the bellman (Carlo I believe??) helped me carry my shopping up to my room. Was a good night, and would go back again.
60. Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again. Â Â Â
61. My husband myself and 13 year old son stayed here June 10-13. We stayed in their studio which consisted of 2 beds refrigeraror microwave eating area. It was a very large room for a great price. The hotel was very clean and centrally located. There was a restraunt in the hotel but we never eat there. There is also an outdoor pool on the 3rd floor. We were very pleased with our stay here and would definetly return! !
62. #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour. One front desk was outright rude and unhelpful for several requests which had to be handled by a morning person who was confused why the evening staff wouldn't help me until I told her the staff name and she rolled her eyes and suggested I speak with management. Director of Operations heard my complaints @ check-out but I did not feel acknowledged. Even after survey completion I did not hear back from them. #3) Sauna listed as an immenity. Don't bother walking down to that. Go in your clothes because it never heats up and this was in the winter. #4) Gave me coupons for the free continental breakfast. 1st time I have ever witnessed that. This gives me concerns as they do not know who their guests are and who isn't. #5) A dead give away that there would be issues is the sign on the building towering over the city is half burnt out. Upkeep issues alarm is sounding and the red flags start coming out. Not of Best western quality. #6) they love running the vacuum cleaner by your room with a quiet sign up before 9:00 am.#7) They own the parking and they ding you for that extra as well and it is in their very own basement. #8) Prostitution active within two block radius Positives: The guys on consierge are kind and most helpful and were the saving grace of this hotel. One even apologized for the front desk staff's negative behaviour over the 3 night's stay. Either of these two gentlemen should be the manager. surrounded by great restauants and a healthy walking distance to shops, Air Canada Centre, CN Tower. Good luck!
63. So we went to Toronto for a girlâ€™s weekend out and booked 2 rooms at the Primrose Hotel online after finding a good deal on Hotwire. We were able to get adjoining rooms which was perfect and each had 2 beds in them. The hotel was in a good location and it was easy to get a cab just outside the hotel to the clubs. The staff were really nice. We had a small issue on check out as a long distance call which we did not place (we didnâ€™t know anyone in Seattle) got accidently added to our bill, but they reversed the charge so it wasnâ€™t a major issue. If you are staying here be warned about the parking though. Its really tight down there, but there is also a public lot outside which you can use. I drive a smaller car so had no issues, but I think someone in a mini van might have trouble. We had a fantastic weekend out, and the hotel was perfect for what we needed.
64. Rude appearing staff. No smiles in any of the faces. Looks very disgruntled employees they have got. Could not sleep the very first night, A/C making too much of rattling noise. A/C not cooling enough. Almost decided to move to another hotel, but didn't because didn't want to go in hassle of moving the luggage with kids, etc. Reported the problem to staff, they say it is very common, not to worry. Not enough lighting. Gloomy room. No freshness feeling at all. Despite it being a kitchenette, it was a joke to have a little stove, no cutleries provided unless asked. Even provided ones were not washed by staff.
65. This is a decent hotel, but factor in the low prices, great location and little perks like free wi-fi, and I'd say that it's one of the best I've stayed in. Not a luxury hotel by any means, but great value for the price. The room was big, clean and quite nice, the bed was very comfortable, there was plenty of hot water... the basics were covered. I found the staff to be helpful and courteous as well. A few very minor complaints - the bathroom was very small and a bit cold, since the only heat was from a small baseboard heater. The TV had something wrong with it and made a loud buzzing noise the whole time it was on, but since I wasn't there to watch TV that wasn't a big deal. I didn't eat at the restaurant, so can't comment on that. Overall, a good experience and I would definitely stay there again.
66. Wound up staying at this hotel by mistake (my wife booked the wrong hotel online). Was a little worried given that it wasn't one of the higher end chains, but we were pleasantly surprised. Staff was extra friendly, room was large and clean, had a great view of the city and we were walking distance to just about everything. It's not a highend hotel, but it's great value for the price. Stan.
67. I am participating in the student residence program and my first thought was that it would be awsome living in a hotel. Well I was wrong. My room connects with another room and you can hear the neighbour's television blasting and their conversations. One night I had the unfortunateness of hearing my neighbour's "good time" if you get my drift. The food is god awful, my stomach had to get used to it. The laundry facilitys are in poor quality. There are only four washers and one is always "out of service". A woman at the front desk is the rudest person i have ever met. The elevators are super slow. I do not recomemnd taking the elevators in the morning if you are only a few flights from the main floor because people are sardined in the elevator please take the stairs. Also I think there is a private school also staying in the hotel because there are little kids in uniforms screaming about. The bathroom has mold on the ceiling and the toilet paper is like tissue paper. There are stains on my bed and it's literally sleeping on a gym mat in student residence. The room thermostat doesn't stay the same temperature. When you turn it down and gradually goes up and if you can sleep only when it's a cool temperature you are going to have to wake up in the middle of the night to turn down the thermostat again. So if you are coming to Primose hotel I would recommend coming during may through august because that's when all the college students and noise is gone. I think they should use the money that they have ripped off people and take some time to fix up their hotel. Also,if you are planing to stay here for student residence don't make it your first choice, please look around maybe stay in a dorm or something.
68. What is wrong with people? This is a good hotel we had no problems with our stay or room. The room was clean there were no stains anywhere, nice bed and dÃ©cor was good. People stay in hotels and expect them to be newly decorated for them rooms have to be used and accommodating. We use many hotels and in our stays, at Best Westerns all over the world have not had a bad one in the chain. Reception staff were polite and respected us, if you give staff respect we always find they give respect back, if you treat staff without respect what do you expect in return? Even housekeeping spoke to us in a morning and passed the time of day. The porterage was efficient and the bell boys were polite. We stayed with a tour on 9/10 September and would have no hesitation at staying or recommending this hotel again. My partner has worked in hotels for over 30 years and a lot of it in management and he would know a bad one as soon as he walked in. We normally take pictures of the rooms we stay in but unforunately did not on this occassion, if had they would have been put on here good or bad.
69. They did not allow us to use the laundry because we were not students (no sense to me). I request early check in and they said we had to pay extra day rate. hair bath front desk staff unhappy and helpless. I would never step into that hotel.
70. 1) Rude staff at the front desk (only one of the employees we dealt with were nice); 2) Restaurant only open part of the time; 3) They DID give us a bigger and cheaper parking space out behind the building because our SUV wouldn't fit in the underground parking, but there were junkies hanging around at that parking lot; 3) FOUND A BEDBUG IN THE BATHROOM SINK (ALIVE) -- 'NUFF SAID!
71. Great location, close to CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Yonge Street, Hockey Hall of Fame. Subway is within walking distance. Tim Hortons onsite. Staff friendly and helpful. Room serviced daily. Only problem was the carpark was too small. (Coming off the street, the turns were tight and narrow.)
72. My firm booked me into the Primrose Hotel for a conference I had to attend in the city. I was pleased with service of the hotel and appreciated the free internet connection. The hotel was very nice, and looks like they are doing renovations. I thought the hotel was in a good location and I found it was easy to walk to restaurants at night. The Tim Hortons in the lobby was also convenient for a late night coffee. All in all, I had a good stay and would recommend this hotel to others looking for good service, clean rooms and reasonable room rates.
73. Checked in early and a King room was not ready yet. Was offered a double (no thanks!) and waited about 10 min until our room was ready. Clean accomodations, location was less than 10 minute walk to subway station. Across the street from the old Maple Leaf Gardens, and it looks like a new grocery store is about to open up there soon. Tim Hortons right in the lobby which was very convenient. It appears this hotel also serves as a university residence, but there was no noise issue with that. My only real complaint is that the elevators were very slow and the computers in the business centre were slow as well. Also disappointed that pool was only outdoor/seasonal. However, sauna looked nice and clean although did not use it.
74. I had to stay an extra night in Toronto and found that my existing hotel (Sheraton Centre) was sold out for the Monday so I had to make a last minute reservation at another hotel. As Toronto was heavily booked up for the evening, I had to stay at the Best Western Primrose, and I was happy it was only for a single night. The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area. I did not trust the underground parking facilities so made sure to bring all my bags and valuables up to my room. The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service. Check in went smoothly and there was no valet on duty to help with our bags, so we brought them up ourselves using one of the baggage carts. The elevators are very small, so getting a cart and two bodies into the tight space was a difficult. The room is pretty much the same quality as the rest of the hotel and was definately a 1 to 2 star experience. We slept soundly and checked out early the next morning. There is a decent diner to the left of the hotel and a great little Thai restaurant on the other side and around the corner. The hotel had a restaurant but it looked to be closed when we went to eat. The rest of the area I would not trust to walk alone at night and there is not a great deal to do other than take a taxi west where the true city begins.
75. We've stayed at the Primrose several times over the last few months, and have had generally good experiences. The rooms are reasonably clean, the beds fairly comfortable, and the staff mostly helpful. It is worth noting that the parking garage has very little clearance, and some of the tightest turns I have ever had to negotiate. If you're claustrophobic, you may want to avoid it! The hotel books a lot of bus tours, and some mornings it can take a very long time to get an elevator, because they are being monopolized by the bus tourists, who are all trying to leave at once. Although the front desk staff can be curt, the management are very helpful and accommodating. Very good value for your money, in a very good location.
76. The hotel is in a nice location, within walking distance of everything touristy. The price is very good and the rooms are large, the only issue with the hotel is its very dated and could do with a revamp. I stayed just under two weeks and I'd use them again.
77. The Hotel is located fairly close to the centre of Toronto. We arrived to find the Hotel underging a refurbishment,which we were not advised of at the time of booking or through the Hotel website. We we awoken with the sound of drills and banging which was not good. We complained and was moved to a room a few floors below,that had already been refurbed. I do not understand why the hotel website did not advise of the works,and the management didnt seem to have an answer either. The Hotel was half full with students. Which although a little unusual did not cause us any problems.
78. This was my first time travelling to Toronto and I must say this hotel ruined it for me. I booked this hotel, because I expected a certain cleanliness that comes with Best Western franchise's. My first room had a window that would not close, so I did not have much time to look around, I went to the front desk and asked to have my room switched. The front desk operator made me feel like it was a nuicence for him to switch my room. My second room also had a window that would not close, there were beer caps scattered throughout the room, there was hair in the tub and on the toilet seat, and the room smelt like an ashtray. I would never ever stay at this hotel again, and may never stay at a best western again.
79. This was my second stay at the Best Western Primrose in the past year and I would have no hestitation in staying again. I booked a smoking room with a king-size bed. It was a business class room, which I didn't really need, but I had anticipated having someone else come along on this trip. The room also included a sofa bed. The room was spacious and clean with an extremely comfortable bed. Is the hotel showing signs of wear? Sure, it's not a new hotel. If I looked closely I could see where the wallpaper had been patched in a spot near the bed's headboard. It wasn't obvious and I only noticed it because I was accessing a wall plug behind the bedside table. The carpet could use replacing for staining, but it wasn't dirty, just old. The lobby was clean, as was the elevator. Checking in and out was very quick. The staff were friendly and efficient. The location is great. Close enough to walk to the Eaton Centre. Close to good restaurants. The subway station is only a few blocks away and the street car passes right in front of the hotel.
80. Great hotel and great price. Went on Bestwestern.com and booked the room online for $89.00 a night. Very clean and the beds were VERY comfortable. You also got two pillows each without asking. Also very quite and it was spring break. The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car. Don't know how some of the vans got down there! Was very safe and you could only access the parking lot with a hotel key. A Cora's breakfast and Starbucks was two blocks away. There was a Tim Hortons in the lobby too. Didn't try the restaurant....got there late! We are going to stay there again for sure next time we visit Toronto.
81. Went to Toronto for a conference which was being held at another hotel close by. Although it would have been more convenient for me to stay at the hotel the meeting was in, their prices were far too expensive for my budget. I got a room at the Best Western Primrose for a very reasonable rate. Even with the cost of the taxi to and from the conference, it was still much cheaper then the other room rate. The hotel was great, and I was pleased with the room. I thought the rooms were very well kept and the bedding looked new. I was also glad that the hotel had free internet access as I had to spend a great deal of time working, and not having to lug everything to a computer room instead of working from my bedroom was very convenient. The staff were friendly and helpful in arranging for taxiâ€™s for me, and always greeted me with a smile. When traveling on business again, I would not hesitate to use this hotel in the future.
82. After reading several of the other reviews, I was apprehensive about staying there. The room was clean, and had a great view. The staff was friendly. The rooms are in need of a remodel. The bathrooms are dated. If you are looking for an expensive four or five star hotel, don't stay here. This hotel is near everything; subway, restaurants, shopping. It offers a good value and excellent location. I parked my car in the garage for two days and took the subway.
83. I stayed at the Best Western Primrose for one night, mid-week. The price was amazing ($90 CAD) and parking was typical at $23/day/in & out privileges. Check-in was fast and friendly. We had a King bed which was comfy and the pillows were great. The room was dated and the bathroom was the same. The furnishings, lighting, and carpets were nothing fancy. No problems in the bathroom, although the toiletries were pretty cheap. There was a nice sitting area and free wireless access. The pool was closed as it is outdoor and opens in the spring. The only problem was that even with 4 elevators, it was common to wait for a full minute for one. They moved very slow but at least they are undergoing renovation. One of the lifts was renovated and looked great, although it was still as slow as the others. All in all, it was a pleasant stay and offered amazing winter prices. For the low rate, I would return, but if it was any higher I'd probably choose a 4-star hotel instead.
84. Had a stop over in Toronto on my way to Montreal and wound up at the Best Western Primrose Hotel (on Carltone St) Much larger Best Western than I've ever stayed at. Nice lobby. Freindly Staff. Large comfortable room & bed. Great wi-fi service too. Excellent breakfast in the AM as well. Staff was friendly, but not all that sure of area attractions. Location is very central. Wasn't expecting much, but will be going back with the wife next month now.
85. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for several nights in June, and were very disappointed. We had made our travel arrangements through Orbitz and didn't know how to cancel part-way through the stay, which is the only reason we didn't check out early. The first night there was no parking garage spot available, so we parked were the hotel recommended. Our car was broken into. The next day when we moved into the garage the attendant said we should never have parked in the previous location because everyone should know that your car would be a target there. The front desk staff were very unfriendly and always seemed to make matters overly complicated. They also didn't all have the same procedures. For instance one staff member refused to believe that another staff member had run our credit card through for a $300.00 account hold for incidentals until I showed him a copy of the receipt. He argued with me that they would only have gotten a $100.00 hold because that was their policy. They also tried to charge me with an extra night's garage parking and I had to get a manager involved to avoid the extra night's charge. I couldn't believe they were trying to stick me for a charge when I hadn't been able to park in the garage, the spot was supposed to be free, the spot was recommended by the hotel staff, AND my car was broken into while parked there. Also, the hotel is a high rise with only a few elevators which the staff also use. The elevators are VERY SLOW and we routinely spent several minutes waiting for them. The staff made no effort to give guests priority on them, either.
86. My husband had a meeting in the city and we were planning on continuing on to Ottawa the next day for more meetings but as it ran late, we decided to stay in Toronto as we lost the last plane to Ottawa. We didn’t have a reservation anywhere, but the Primrose Hotel was the closest hotel and so we were able to get a room without at reservation. We really didn’t need much other than a place that was close to a restaurant and internet access, both of which they had (internet was free too unlike other places I have been to). The room was clean and comfortable. No problems with check out and overall found it to be a nice place.
87. I wan't expecting much from this hotel and that's what I got. The general feeling of this hotel was tired and run down. We had to switch rooms the first night due to plumbing issues (shower didn't work, toilet leaked). Only good thing was that it was a few blocks from the subway.
88. I would like to advise anyone staying at this hotel not to use their front counter safety deposit boxes. They have a rather primitive system of giving you a box without a key for you to put your valuables into and hand back to the front desk clerk. The clerk then places your box under the counter and then hands you a key which supposedly is the only key to that box. The problem is you do not see where your box is being placed and how it is secured. $2000.00 was stolen for me last weekend because I trusted this obviously poor safety deposit system. Be warned.
89. Met some long time friends in toronto for the weekend, I decided to come into town last minuet and found the primrose cause the delta gave my room away? The hotel is older but the room was huge and had a view all the way to the lake. Staff was pleasant enough and made a point to call after i checked in to see how i was. My friends and I enjoyed the weekend it was fun. I will come back to Primrose.
90. Came into Toronto to meet up with some friends for a concert, booked a room on Hotwire looking for a good deal. Wasn't familiar with this Best Western, but I was hoping it wasn't like a few I had stated at on a trip to Florida last year. Luckily it wasn't like any Best Western I had ever been to - this is a large full service hotel. First thing I noticed was they had a Tim Horton's in the lobby, sweet! Ultra friendly staff at the desk - they let me check in a couple of hours early. Room was BIG, bed was comfy, had an a good size fridge in it too and it's the first hotel I've been to in a while where the internet was free and fast. Area was pretty cool too, lots of little restaurants in walking distance (great Chinese place right across the street.) And just like my stay out at the airport, I made the mistake of not paying attention to the breakfast prices before I started ordering. What is it with $20 hotel breakfasts in Toronto? Anyway, I saw a sign for a breakfast place right next door that said $4.99 bacon & eqqs - I'll know for next time. Highly recommended for the price!
91. This was my 4th trip to Toronto and my second time staying at the Primrose Hotel. I stayed there for a conference in 2006 and was surprised at all the changes. They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting. I also noticed lots of changes in the rooms. Last time I stayed I made mention of the sheets being very startchy and now they have very comfortable duvets which are much softer. The location is good and it was close to a great Thai food restaurant which I would recommend if you like Thai. The service was good and everyone seemed very friendly and helpful. I would have no problems recommending this hotel to my friends.
92. We decided to surprise our kids and took them to Toronto for a few days for some family time last Christmas holidays. We booked a room online at the Primrose Hotel as we are familiar with the brand and the standards they adhere to. We had an absolutely fabulous time. The hotel is in a great location and we were close to the CN Tower, the museum and the Hockey Hall of Fame. The only attraction we had to drive to was the Science Centre, but it was only about 20 minutes from downtown, and the front desk lady was nice enough to give us a map and write out the driving instructions for us so we made it without getting lost. The room was perfect for us, and had 2 queen beds and a great view of the lake (we were on the 20th floor). It also had kids movies which was great for calming the kids down at the end of the day. There were lots of restaurants around, and found the area and city in general to be very family friendly. It was a great mini vacation and something we plan to do again in the summer.
93. I've travelled to Toronto before and this hotel, I would consider to be below average. Although most of the staff were nice, the rooms were dated and could use some renovation. There aren't many facilities and the internet in my room cut out once in a while. Overall, a good central location for the price I paid, but I choose another hotel if given the choic again.
94. On the upside this place is reasonable priced and the rooms are clean, quiet, and with comfortable beds. The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out. The staff while not rude are not as friendly as one would expect. Beware of what looks like a continental breakfast as it is not nor are there any signs indicating charge. The breakfast is $12.95 for pre cooked eggs, bacon,etc. There are much better deals just down the street. Or grab a coffee and bagel at the Tim Hortons right next door. As a solo female traveler I would not walk around the area at night so if you are travelling on your own other hotels near restaurants and services might be a better idea.
95. My company recently booked a training session at the Primrose Hotel in Toronto. We were very pleased with the service and the meeting space. We occupied the Starlight room on the 23rd floor and found the room to be ideal for our training sessions. Because of the windows we were able to have natural light which helped keep people alert and didnâ€™t feel like we were stuck in a closed off room all day. We did order food and beverage and were pleased with the variety of choices available for lunches. The food was good and arrived on time and hot. The service was excellent and the session went without a hitch. Several of the attendees also stayed at the hotel and were able to get a discounted rate as part of the session. Overall our event went well and we do plan to hold our next meeting in the same room.
96. Booked this Hotel for a three night stay at the beginning of my holiday to Canada, and was very pleased with my choice. Room was spacious, spotlessly clean and I had a great view of the Toronto skyline from the 19th floor. All the staff I encountered were friendly and couldn't have been more helpful, which I found very reassuring as a lone female traveller on her first trip to Canada. Shame they couldn't have arranged the weather!! The hotel is within an easy walk to many attractions and shops, with a subway station close by for venturing further afield. Thank you very much Best Western Primrose. All
97. We travelled to Toronto for medical reasons which required a 12 night stay. After doing much research, I found this to be an acceptable hotel. We had one of their kitchenette rooms that had a microwave, small fridge, coffee maker and counter/sink area; complete with utensils, although I brought my own disposable ones. The beds/pillows are by far the best feature. They are comfortable with nice bedding. The bathroom was average. The view overlooked the downtown area and was close to hospitals if you were up for a brisk walk. The biggest disappointments were: -Elevators (being "updated", bumpy ride, not reliable-ended up on a floor we didn't know we could access!) -Restaurant (Was not regularly opened. Had daily continental or hot breakfast for an unreasonable cost for the 'menu' - try the local restaurants or delivery) Overall, reasonable cost for duration; comfortable, quiet, clean rooms; and you receive Best Western Club points or Airmiles for your stay.
98. My wife and I recently attended a wedding in Toronto and stayed at the Primrose Hotel as it was close to the reception. We were pleased with the service we received. We were given room 1904 which had a large king bed and sitting area. The room was clean and well decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable. I found however that the room was a little dark at night though as there were several lamps but only an overhead light by the door. The staff were very pleasant and we had no issues with them. We did not use the restaurant in the hotel but did enjoy the Tim Hortons coffee shop beside the check in area. We had a good time in the city and would use the Primrose Hotel again.
99. Hotel staff were very friendly and accomadating. Vicky at the front desk was very nice and made us feel welcome. The hotel is situated in a good area and walking distance to Eaton Centre and many other attractions. We were there for a Chicago concert at Massey Hall and it was about a ten minute walk. We also experienced the subway and found it was very easy to get around. Over all our hotel was clean and we had a newly renovated room. I would stay here again!
100. I used the sales department at the hotel to make a booking for a block of rooms coming to Toronto for a family wedding. I was very pleased with the arrangements made, and since we werenâ€™t exactly sure how many rooms we needed, the hotel allowed us to reserve 15 rooms, and provided we told them a few weeks in advance, didnâ€™t charge us for the rooms which we didnâ€™t need. They were also able to give us rooms all on the same floor which made things much easier to get ready on the morning of the wedding. We ended up with 12 rooms in total and no one in our group had any problems or complaints. I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking. We all really enjoyed our stay, and hope that sometime in the future, we will be able to return to Toronto and explore the city more since we really didnâ€™t get much time to look around.
