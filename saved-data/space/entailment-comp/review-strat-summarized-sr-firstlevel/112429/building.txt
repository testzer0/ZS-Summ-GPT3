[0.9814548492431641] the lobby is sort of lackluster but the rooms were tasfully updated and very clean.
[0.8173675537109375] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[0.3558387756347656] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.
