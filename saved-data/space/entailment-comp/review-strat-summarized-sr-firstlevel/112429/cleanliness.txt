[0.0667877197265625] It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.
[-0.00637054443359375] I ended up with a very early morning arrival flight, and hoped that the hotel would hold my bags until check in since I had a meeting at 11am... they let me check into my room at 9:30am!
[-0.010471343994140625] We then called down to have our car retrieved from the valet upon checking out.
[-0.015125274658203125] The Dragonfish Sushi is right in the hotel downstairs.
[-0.016918182373046875] Hotel concierge, Tom, provided us with valuable information on how to save lots of money by taking light rail from the airport to the hotel, only 2 blocks from light rail station.
