[0.00927734375] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.

[0.3505439758300781] We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased.
[0.34113311767578125] Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9879288673400879] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.9835071563720703] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[-0.97930908203125] To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.
[-0.9646234512329102] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).

[0.025214195251464844] We needed a hotel near the airport for just one night, and selected the Doubletree.
[0.016597747802734375] I was then given another "Hilton Honors" room.
[0.0117340087890625] Decided to stay one night by the airport and used priceline to get a room and ended up with the doubletree at a good rate!
[0.010303497314453125] The hotel is pretty big but the location next to the airport is great.
[0.007556915283203125] Upgrade to King Corner Room or Penthouse to really treat yourself, balcony are amazing in these rooms.

[-0.4005851745605469] (For the discounted price) The room was very large, faced the airport, but was still quiet.
[-0.2980194091796875] We explored the other areas of this large hotel complex and noticed some rooms were actually are on a small lake, and others overlook the attractive outdoor pool.
[-0.2220001220703125] There is no complimentary breakfast; there is a coffee shop and an espresso bar that also sells yogurt, bagels and pastries.

[0.747283935546875] The wing hallways had a damp smell.
[0.02092742919921875] But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected.

[0.48688507080078125] We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied.
[0.4755363464355469] We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac.
[0.42945098876953125] Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport.
[0.3505439758300781] We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased.
[0.34113311767578125] Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9879288673400879] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.9835071563720703] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[-0.97930908203125] To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.
[-0.9646234512329102] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).

[0.131805419921875] Lovely spacious Doubletree, with gift shop and a very good restaurant inside it.
[0.1197509765625] The rooms in the wings are larger than those in the tower and if you get wings 2 or 3 closer than walking to the tower wing plus no elevator hassle.
[0.07135009765625] Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.
[0.07074546813964844] The rooms are a good size, which is a bonus for me as I was traveling with my husband and two large teenaged sons in one room.
[0.063385009765625] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
