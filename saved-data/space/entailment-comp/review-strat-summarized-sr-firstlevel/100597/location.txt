[0.9813327789306641] Staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are decent, and it's very close to the airport.
[0.9809427261352539] --Location is very convenient to the airport, and pretty quick access to I-5.
[0.9784622192382812] The good news - the hotel is very close to the airport with a 24hr shuttle to the airport.
[0.9738168716430664] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.

[-0.8992710113525391] We were told we had a great view of the "lake" from our room.
[-0.799560546875] This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking.
[-0.5726356506347656] Our room was connected to the main lobby by a skyway; we were in building 5 -- it wasn't very close.
[-0.47556304931640625] I understand charging when leaving the car consecutive days when not using the hotel, but there shouldn't be a charge at a suburban hotel for guests for one night.
[-0.45855712890625] I can see paying parking for a downtown hotel - but for a hotel at Sea-Tac it seemed absurd to have to pay parking.
