[0.44722747802734375] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[0.3937530517578125] *The art in the rooms are old and are of Delta, why not GI?
[0.3008880615234375] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[0.013092041015625] Nothing a little renovation couldn't quickly take care of.
[0.00225830078125] The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.

[-0.16436767578125] While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
[-0.1616363525390625] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
