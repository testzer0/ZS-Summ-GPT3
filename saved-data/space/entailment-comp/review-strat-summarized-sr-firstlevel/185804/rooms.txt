[-0.9947090148925781] That being said, my room was only okay.
[-0.9901332855224609] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.9900321960449219] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.9807806015014648] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.9069938659667969] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!

[-0.9430465698242188] My rating would have been 5 stars, except the room was quite small for two people 5 days, and the only view was over a roof and hvac unit.
[-0.7111673355102539] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.702728271484375] The only drawback could be room size as ours was only just adequate and the view was rather restricted.

[0.612152099609375] We were initially worried as our room was adjacent to the patio and we feared lots of noise, but it was quiet after 10 pm, the beds were great and we both a great sleep, and really enjoyed visiting the market before we left for Kelowna.

[-0.8815345764160156] While at the hotel we hosted a dinner for 30 people in the Dockside and everybody that I spoke with raved about the dinner,even the locals who had never been there are very keen to come back.
[-0.8436660766601562] Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc.
[-0.825836181640625] Bathrooms are super-luxorious.
[-0.8061676025390625] We especially loved the modern shower with rainfall, massage, and regular options.
[-0.7161788940429688] Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling.

[-0.2135028839111328] We only have two comments - we were planning on a "nightcap" when we got back from the theatre on a Saturday night at 10:30 - only to discover that both the dining room and the lounge were closed at this early hour.
