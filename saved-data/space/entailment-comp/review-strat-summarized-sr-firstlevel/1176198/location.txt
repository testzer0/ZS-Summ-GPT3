[0.0809326171875] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended
[0.076019287109375] We were on the 9th floor facing West and the view was so-so, but to be honest I wasn't there for the view anyway.
[0.07073974609375] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.

[0.6566276550292969] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.5635223388671875] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.220855712890625] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.

[0.9787964820861816] The nightclub next door is noisy.
Parent: There is a nightclub next door which can be noisy at night.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9787964820861816] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.
[0.9425640106201172] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.8513851165771484] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.7391128540039062] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.
[0.08230209350585938] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.

[-0.841954231262207] There was an event on at the nightclub one night and I never heard anything.
[-0.5168857574462891] Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.
[-0.33745574951171875] It is convenient to a nearby Shopper's Drug Mart (to pick up some in room snacks) and a large LCBO with a rather big Vintages section for some excellent wine for the room.
[-0.2433624267578125] They don't keep change in the restaurant!!!
[-0.2171344757080078] Close to lots of restaurants, a Whole Foods and two streetcar lines making it easy to get around.

[0.7121467590332031] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.00899505615234375] Three of us stayed for two nights on a hectic trip, arriving on an overnight flight from the States.

Parent: Parking is expensive.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9610214233398438] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[0.9555997848510742] Parking rates are high as you will find in all major cities around the world.
[0.933837890625] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.
[0.8350334167480469] It was worth the cost of the parking just to have their assistance.
[0.8265781402587891] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
