[0.02301025390625] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.

[-0.8575019836425781] It is clear this hotel has no loading dock or alley because while I was eating dinner at the award winning restaurant downstairs (Charlie Palmer's) I had big trucks pulling up within 10 ft of my table loading and unloading big crates of towels (I learned they outsource their linens) and other large pieces of equipment.
[-0.514862060546875] My wife and I celebrated our anniversary this weekend.
[-0.4717369079589844] Charlie Palmer (the Joule's in house restaurant) is whole other raving review waiting to happen.

[-0.9568557739257812] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9330501556396484] This hotel has a very cramped feel.
[-0.9254074096679688] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[-0.9155654907226562] It was very crowded, you could barely move, but the drinks were very good.
[-0.7973251342773438] So, one word of caution; empty your car entirely when parking in their valet lot.
