[0.49169921875] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[0.13086700439453125] My only complaint about our room was that one side faced east and the bathroom window was not adequately covered so the morning sun lit up the whole room.

[-0.7640724182128906] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.5167922973632812] Well it started off BAD within 10 mins we had went to the pool where we find about 5 young ladies workin and just stood there looking like we where not even there, so I was like excuse me can I get a drink.
[-0.3562202453613281] It was almost as if the hotel lobby and elevators were wearing cologne and it was a good scent but I am a little sensitive to scents so it was a little strong for me but was nice when walking in from the street.
[-0.329193115234375] All I can say is.....AMAZING.
[-0.28619384765625] The gym is in desperate need of an upgrade.

[-0.9639987945556641] I wasn't crazy about the way the bathroom is a bit open to the room.
[-0.9050140380859375] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.8738555908203125] My only complaint about our room was that one side faced east and the bathroom window was not adequately covered so the morning sun lit up the whole room.
[-0.8028564453125] The rooms are awesome except for the lack of privacy in the toilets that others have mentioned.
[-0.7997245788574219] other than that the bathroom is not very private so if you want to preserve the "romance" factor you'll need to make a trip to the lobby because the ballroom level restroom is kept locked.

[0.360595703125] The master bedroom was beautiful, comfortable and had great views of downtown Dallas.
[0.16497802734375] The roof top pool area is so romatic and the bartenders keep your glasses full.
[0.132080078125] The roof top pool was like a spa and even though it was 102 degrees, it felt very comfortable because of the fans and the misting system.
[0.100189208984375] The POOL scene is incredible on the roof!

[-0.9255962371826172] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.

[-0.7813072204589844] The gym is okay, but somewhat small.

[0.04052734375] An Infinity pool hangs over Main Street providing for a unique panorama of downtown Dallas.
[0.035511016845703125] I will hopefully be back -- as the revitalized Main St. has a lot of action on the weekends and this hotel sits right in the middle!
[0.0250244140625] It was a salt water pool on the 12th floor that juts out over Main Street in Dallas.
[0.02392578125] The pool with the inifinty edge over Main St was an added attraction, great place to hang out and people watch!
