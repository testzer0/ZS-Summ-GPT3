[0.7240123748779297] Would stay there again as price was great and location perfect.

[0.8420209884643555] We mentioned on check in that it was our anniversary and were immediately upgraded from our room with 1 double to a king room on the highest floor with a wonderful view of the city.
[0.775665283203125] The best thing about the room was its view.
[0.7366485595703125] We were on the 22nd floor and the view was to die for.
[0.6561679840087891] The view overlooked the downtown area and was close to hospitals if you were up for a brisk walk.
[0.6333398818969727] Our room had a south view of the city with a fantistic view of downtown and the lake.

[0.8064556121826172] The hotel was in a good location and it was easy to get a cab just outside the hotel to the clubs.
[0.7405891418457031] The Hotel is in walking distance to most major attractions and the public transportation is easily accessible.
[0.7325229644775391] The hotel is within an easy walk to many attractions and shops, with a subway station close by for venturing further afield.

[0.9818487167358398] The hotel has a parking garage.
Parent: The only complaints were about the parking garage being hard to manoevre and the hotel being located near a subway station.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9818487167358398] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.9563789367675781] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.9383430480957031] For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not.
[0.8831863403320312] I couldn't believe they were trying to stick me for a charge when I hadn't been able to park in the garage, the spot was supposed to be free, the spot was recommended by the hotel staff, AND my car was broken into while parked there.
[0.721527099609375] To get to the parking lot from the guest floors you will need to use an access card in the elevators; if you are not quick enough, or your card doesn't work properly, you will find that you are called to another floor.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8239517211914062] Before checking in, they rudely told us that the parking space we had requested had been given to someone else and that we were to go down the street to public parking lot.
[-0.6521186828613281] This restaurant has a loyal group of customers.
[-0.5797119140625] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[-0.5540943145751953] There was a restraunt in the hotel but we never eat there.

[-0.9253292083740234] Across the street from the old Maple Leaf Gardens, and it looks like a new grocery store is about to open up there soon.
[-0.8916397094726562] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).
[-0.845611572265625] the one across the street from the "Made in China" chinese restaurant, which was decent cheap eats on it's own!
[-0.8312149047851562] It was close to the theatre we were going to and the price was affordable.
[-0.7916374206542969] The hotel was in a good location and was close to restaurants and a wonderful greenhouse which I toured for an entire afternoon.
