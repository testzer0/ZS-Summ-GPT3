[0.9414701461791992] Breakfast was better than i have had in any other American hotel and the staff were always helpful and cheerful.
[0.9127616882324219] I am an early riser(6.30 to 7am) and so I had the breakfast area to myself but did get much busy later on.I found all staff to be very helpfull There are a few restaurants and fast food places within walking distance and a Walgreens not far away There is a shuttle bus to Epcot (you need to use Disney Transport to get to other parks) it leaves at 8.45am and about 1pm.
[0.8187408447265625] This is the 3rd time my family have stayed in this hotel & yes it does need a revamp & is a bit worn & tired but the staff are friendly & provide a good service.
[0.6107749938964844] This is passably the best deal in the WDW area I have been to WDW over 50 times staying everywhere from the Grand Floridian to the Gator Motel this is the best deal I have found the rooms were clean (they even steam cleaned the carpets mid week) we had a view of Expedition Everest from our room the housekeeping staff was thorough and friendly as well as the front desk attendants the continental breakfast was no more than doughnuts some muffins and toast juice, milk and coffee I was traveling with a 1 and a 3 year old and didn't have to worry about them crawling on the floor

[-0.9876241683959961] The staff was exteremly rude, rooms out dated and smelled!
[-0.9818782806396484] This hotel has a serious bed bug problem and they are not willing to take care of the issue.
[-0.9731235504150391] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.
[-0.5272579193115234] We left the next day after a nightmare night and overcrowded non eatable breakfast that you had to stay in line for half an hour.
[-0.47414398193359375] It was just kind of old/dated & grimy!

[-0.9751608371734619] Bottom line - do yourself a favor: NEVER STAY at this flea bag of a hotel.
[-0.9557790756225586] AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!
[-0.9381923675537109] A hidden treasure of small shops with amusement rides that I didn't even know about ( I only drove by it over a dozen times) and it's mostly free!
[-0.9139418601989746] I would not recommend this hotel really - it is very basic, so is the breakfast
[-0.8444480895996094] I especially enjoyed the quiet nights, even though it's next to a busy highway.
