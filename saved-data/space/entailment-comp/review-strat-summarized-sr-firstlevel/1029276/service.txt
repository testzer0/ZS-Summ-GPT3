[0.2835121154785156] Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls.
[0.029819488525390625] Coming from Europe, it takes some time to get used to the "rip me off at every corner" culture in the States, but this was just going too far.

[-0.9755005836486816] Staff lied that the bus system of Miami was very difficult to use when in fact it was more inexpensive and a lot easier than getting around w/ a taxi.
[-0.9427275657653809] I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
[-0.8740339279174805] Would honestly give 3.5 but 3 is a bit low.

[-0.9954729080200195] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
[-0.994938850402832] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.

[-0.9881973266601562] Due to on-site construction, elevator service was horrible.
[-0.9878225326538086] I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami.

[-0.893585205078125] They would leave dirty glasses and leave new ones and they did not change the sheets.
[-0.8651313781738281] The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in.
