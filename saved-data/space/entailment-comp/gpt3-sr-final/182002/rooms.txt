[0.6668148040771484] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
[0.5660972595214844] For the price we paid for this hotel and the round trip airfare booked through Travelocity, it was a steal.

[0.11639404296875] The only issue I did not like was that the fan in the bathroom automatically turns on when you turn on the light, and usually my wife likes to sleep with the bathroom light on, but we didnâ€™t as the fan would be running.
