[0.395294189453125] Relatively safe neighborhood in the "gay" area, but there were a few crazies walking the streets and some just high on drugs.
[0.0451202392578125] Several churches of different denominations are dotted around Allan Park that is across the street.
[0.02735137939453125] It appears this hotel also serves as a university residence, but there was no noise issue with that.
[0.016937255859375] There were lots of restaurants around, and found the area and city in general to be very family friendly.
[0.01396942138671875] I saw some work being done in the lobby and wonder if they also did the rooms as our furniture looked to be new and had no damage or wear you normally see.

[-0.6612472534179688] Our car was broken into.
[-0.62481689453125] If you get on an elevator that is packed, forget about getting to the card reader.
