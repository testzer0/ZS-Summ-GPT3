[0.4441070556640625] There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.

[-0.163330078125] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).

[0.9291877746582031] The parking is difficult.
Parent: Some reviewers also found the parking to be difficult and the street around the hotel to be unsafe.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9291877746582031] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.8915882110595703] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.8575210571289062] The parking garage was a little tight to drive around in, but other than that, I would definately go back for another weekend with the guys.
[0.8566646575927734] The underground parking is horribly laid out.
[0.8481712341308594] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.

[0.022182464599609375] The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out.
[0.00771331787109375] The rest of the area I would not trust to walk alone at night and there is not a great deal to do other than take a taxi west where the true city begins.
[0.0068607330322265625] The ramps are very steep, the spots are narrow and the driving room is almost non-existent.
