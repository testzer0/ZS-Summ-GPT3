[0.0206451416015625] We reserved a guest room which was beautiful and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast on the patio Saturday morning at Charlie Palmer's Restaurant.
[0.0155792236328125] I loved Charlie Palmer's.
[0.01433563232421875] Dinner at Charlie Palmer's was terrific and it finished with an anniversary card of sorts with a message spelled in chocolate at the top of our unbelievably rich Peanut Butter Bar - which btw, was practically a religious experience!
[0.0139007568359375] Additionally, if you want a quick bite while on the road - the bar at Charlie Palmer's offers a great menu for the solo diner.
[0.009738922119140625] Charlie Palmers is a wonderful restaurant and also supplys room service.

[-0.73883056640625] Also, it was very nice to be next door to Neiman Marcus.
[-0.4641599655151367] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[-0.27349853515625] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[-0.24506759643554688] There is a Neiman Marcus and a decent Mexican restaurant next door, but there's also a boarded up building.
[-0.21613502502441406] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.

[0.29831790924072266] The pool is amazing and the restaurant cuisine is outstanding.
[0.22869873046875] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.0044708251953125] Their nightclub, PM, manages the pool area.
[0.0038366317749023438] We were on the 10th floor which is where the Pool/Bar is located.
[0.0028600692749023438] I could not have had a more relaxing anniversary weekend.

[-0.26690673828125] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.
[-0.23374366760253906] Trip to this hotel started off VERY poorly with a bungled reservation.
[-0.19144439697265625] Only little tiny thing is the location ...
[-0.186737060546875] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[-0.14884662628173828] This hotel has a very cramped feel.

[0.5919532775878906] We wish the weather had been warmer so we could have tried out the pool.
[0.22249889373779297] Wish the weather had been nice enough to use the pool.
[0.06975936889648438] The only downside was that I was there in January, and the Poule was not open.
[0.00821685791015625] The guest who remained were forced to go across the street to a dive bar where the b-day girl began to cry uncontrollably over her ruined special evening.
[-0.0014801025390625] Had we been paying attention though, we could have asked for a room on the back side of the hotel when we made our reservation.
