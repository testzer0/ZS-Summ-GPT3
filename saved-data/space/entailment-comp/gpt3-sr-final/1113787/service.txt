[0.356170654296875] I have read some of the reviews that spoke of bad service.
[0.24524688720703125] However, Shawn at the bar, Scott the restaurant's executive chef, and Todd at the hotel bar have MORE than made up for the rough start.
[0.1399993896484375] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
