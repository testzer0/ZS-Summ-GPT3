[0.08607864379882812] First, the shuttle service they offered took us to the wrong theme park 40 minutes late without any explanation.
[0.0246734619140625] The wireless internet--somewhat annoying to have to go to the lobby, since it doesn't reach to the rooms.
[0.0140533447265625] Don't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney!
[0.010894775390625] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
