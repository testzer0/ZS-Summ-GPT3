Parent: Overall, reviewers were pleased with the rooms at the Marriott Eaton Centre.

----- Supporting -----

[0.4621105194091797] I recently stayed at Marriott Eaton Center and had a wonderful stay.
[0.36553955078125] The room was typically Marriott - very nice, great view of the Church and gardens in between the Eaton Centre.
[0.3087644577026367] We enjoyed our stay at the Marriott Eaton Centre with a few minor quibbles.
[0.2914295196533203] I stayed for three nights at the Marriott Eaton Centre, which I really enjoyed.
[0.2815685272216797] Just came back from a four night stay at the Marriott Downtown Eaton Centre, and I was completely satisfied with this hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8546237945556641] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
[-0.8487653732299805] During our recent trip we stayed in 5 hotels in Canada and this was by far the worst.
[-0.7933692932128906] It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.
[-0.7701797485351562] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.
[-0.7060279846191406] However, the rooms are very average (no safe, mini-bar for example).

[-0.9655303955078125] While the beds were comfy and we had plenty of room, the guest rooms are in need of a renovation.
[-0.9586524963378906] The toilet did not flush properly and the shower seemed to have only 2 temperatures: scalding hot or freezing cold.
[-0.94439697265625] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.
