[-0.5528488159179688] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[-0.10082626342773438] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[-0.0585784912109375] The location was good for us but it is definitely not the nicest area of town.
[-0.02862548828125] The Only drawback of this hotel is that usage of Business Center is a bit expensive and so is the Restauant in the hotel for the qulaity of food.
[-0.02257537841796875] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!
