[0.1768970489501953] Other food in the lounge was good (fruit, coffee).
[0.17108917236328125] The drinks and food are pricey in the hotel, but then again in Miami everything seems to be expensive.

[-0.9879086017608643] There is no food or entertainment around.
[-0.9828987121582031] Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
