[0.9204177856445312] Hotel was ideally located for the purpose of my business trip.
[0.9183778762817383] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
[0.914614200592041] Not right in South Beach, but this hotel still has a very good location near the Biscayne Bay with beautiful views!
[0.8644132614135742] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.
[0.7787666320800781] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!

[0.344696044921875] Location is walkable to the Arsht Center, American Airlines Arena, and Bayside, but you would need a taxi/car for anything else.
[0.3126220703125] The hotel is a three minute walk to the Metromover which will take you to Bayside in a couple of minutes where there is nightlife, shops, drinks, and restaurants.
[0.1614990234375] nearby the Bayside arena and a short drive to Miami Beach (art Deco).
[0.156890869140625] When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore.
