[-0.9808616638183594] Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.

[0.9793376922607422] Too bad considering the hotel facilities are lovely and the rooms are comfortable and spacious.

[0.9447669982910156] Even though the hotel was close to the airport, you couldn't haer the planes taking off, it was quiet and very relaxing.
[0.6812591552734375] This is a pretty rundown hotel.
[0.45703125] This Doubletree is very tired, and more like a 2 star property than a 3 star.
[0.3805122375488281] Room was quiet and the shuttle to the airport runs 24 hours.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.997227668762207] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[-0.9946918487548828] The hotel is big and busy, so it always feels like there is some commotion going on in the common areas.
[-0.9946508407592773] --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
[-0.9943780899047852] But the rooms are a great size, and we noticed large groups of flight attendants from various airlines staying there as well.
[-0.9908027648925781] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.

**********

[0.6513519287109375] The food prices are too high.
Parent: However, some guests have complained about the food prices and overall cost of the hotel.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6513519287109375] With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room.
[0.6351470947265625] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).
[0.04953765869140625] Overall, the room is nice, but could have a refrigerator in it for the price.
[0.00769805908203125] Priceline should be ASHAMED of rating it up with the Hilton SEATAC, where I was placed on the first night.
[0.0029439926147460938] Overall, if this were MY money, I would NOT stay here.
