[-0.9284324645996094] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[-0.8381996154785156] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.
[-0.8122920989990234] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!
[-0.7400627136230469] We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee.
