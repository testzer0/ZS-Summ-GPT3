[0.05126953125] Cheap toiletries, few towels.
[-0.010250091552734375] For those using the hotel to fly there are shuttles, flight info, and a kiosk to print out boarding passes (although it did not work for me).
[-0.011320114135742188] We found the Doubletree to be good for what we needed- a place to stay when our plane arrived late and we didn't want to start driving anywhere until the next day.
[-0.011722564697265625] Unfortunately there was no wifi and the parking was $16 per night - expensive for the area.
[-0.0138092041015625] The fitness room is small but the bedrooms are standard.
