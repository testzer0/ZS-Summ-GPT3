[0.042072296142578125] The valet man was excellent.
[0.03692626953125] The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the decor in good taste (lots of texture, neutral tone, and rich burgandy to soothe the spirit).
[0.009000778198242188] Lolita was great as well.
[0.005633831024169922] Getting my car from the valet took less than three minutes... My stay at the Paramount was a very pleasant and positive experience.
[0.005535125732421875] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).

[-0.9762191772460938] The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.
[-0.9143867492675781] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.
[-0.8985509872436523] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[-0.87811279296875] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.

[0.3602752685546875] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
