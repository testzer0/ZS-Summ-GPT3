[0.8059616088867188] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.
[0.011079788208007812] The elevator was marked and scuffed.
[0.007007598876953125] The lobby is warm and cozy with couches and a fireplace.
[0.00598907470703125] The furniture was comfortable.
[0.00274658203125] That was my only real complaint, that weird gappy window/air thing.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9743080139160156] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[-0.9449996948242188] the lobby is sort of lackluster but the rooms were tasfully updated and very clean.
[-0.3445281982421875] We nearly thought our car was stolen!
[-0.27739715576171875] Tons of construction in the neighborhood which starts at 6:30 am.
[-0.1452178955078125] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.
