[0.2776679992675781] I have stayed in many of the downtown hotels in Seattle and I have to say that the Paramount is one of the nicest hotels downtown.
[0.2563972473144531] We found the Paramount hotel an exceptional value for our purpose.
[0.2476959228515625] The hotel continues to impress and deliver an experience that is in-line with other major downtown Seattle chain hotels that charge a room rate that can be up to double what I pay at the Paramount.

[-0.8993148803710938] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.718017578125] The rooms for the price were not very good.
