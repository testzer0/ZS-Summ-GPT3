[0.035552978515625] The valet man was excellent.
[0.0274810791015625] The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the decor in good taste (lots of texture, neutral tone, and rich burgandy to soothe the spirit).
[0.022247314453125] The only aspect of the hotel that could be improved, in my opinion, is the fitness center -- it's in the basement and has older equipment.
[0.01595306396484375] The decor fits well with the holidays.
[0.0102996826171875] There is a coffee maker and an empty refrigerator.

[-0.9832925796508789] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.
[-0.9531211853027344] The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.
[-0.8943262100219727] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[-0.8279762268066406] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.
[-0.79766845703125] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.

[0.119659423828125] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
