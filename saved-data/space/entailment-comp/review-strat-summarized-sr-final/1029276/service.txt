[-0.96795654296875] I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami.

[0.9856762886047363] The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in.
[0.90411376953125] Downtown did not feel safe at all, and there were alot of unsavoury looks as we did walk 4 blocks from the Hotel.
[0.16438007354736328] Regardless of what you are told it is not safe for anyone.
[0.0684661865234375] If you don't know the system you will go around in circles and the cars are invested with local hoodlums and drunks.

[0.069427490234375] They also had a business center with free internet access for guests, so we were able to check our flight info, which was a big help.
[0.059326171875] On the upside the manager bought us dinner and drinks at the restaurant for our inconvenience at check-in and he was very apologetic and nice.
[0.0306396484375] In this case, it was the staff that made the event run smoothly.

[-0.58154296875] Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls.
[-0.469482421875] Watch out for the unfortuneates in our society.
[-0.40704345703125] As the hours wore on, I became increasingly agitated with United Airlines which could not confirm with certainty the location of my bag or when it would be delivered.
