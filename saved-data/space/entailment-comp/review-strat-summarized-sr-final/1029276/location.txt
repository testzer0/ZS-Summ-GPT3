[0.481781005859375] The accounts were mixed.
Parent: The accounts were mixed on the location of the hotel.

----- Supporting -----

[0.481781005859375] So even though there was a mix up with my bag which caused me some frustration and sleeplessness, the Hilton more than made up for it.
[0.2764892578125] Relaxing versus the 24 hour party going on at South Beach (though that was great as well).
[0.22467041015625] On-site restaurant was simply okay, surrounding neighborhood was very blah, and the staff was ambivalent.
[0.0958251953125] One other note..the restaurant in the hotel is nice but the waiters are drenched in cologne so that is all you smell and taste.
[0.0560302734375] Parking is super expensive, but that's Miami for you, at $28 per day.

[0.9279041290283203] Not right in South Beach, but this hotel still has a very good location near the Biscayne Bay with beautiful views!
[0.8852939605712891] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
[0.8693637847900391] Hotel was ideally located for the purpose of my business trip.
[0.7475509643554688] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.
[0.6395587921142578] Great meeting space adn overall a well managed Hilton.

[0.28449440002441406] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!
[0.2646331787109375] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.05706787109375] Im confident that given more time I could have found something more pleasing for the second half of our family vacation.
[0.023223876953125] I also told the front desk manager Christopher that it was a special trip as both my daughters had birthdays.

[-0.01576519012451172] Finally, despite the name, it's not really downtown per se, but a 5 minute drive from downtown.
[-0.01668548583984375] I'd suggest Hilton put a few dollars into a rehab.
[-0.017444610595703125] One more note parking is 28 per day, and internet 10 bucks for 24 hrs - again something expected in a downtown major city ..no real place to park otherwise, so this may be the only option, or cab it..
