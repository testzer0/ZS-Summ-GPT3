[-0.9683351516723633] There is no food or entertainment around.
[-0.961456298828125] There was one occasion in which we ordered from the menu, sadly it was a little disappointing because it was overcooked but we were taken care of almost immediately when we complained.
[-0.9535655975341797] Recommendation: eat elsewhere; even room service would probably have been better.
[-0.9294013977050781] Horrible club sandwich!
[-0.920562744140625] The first night our food orders took forever and tonight I never got my slice of pie and our second round of drinks never arrived.

[0.8152694702148438] Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
[0.2089080810546875] Cold fat soaked bacon, processed meats, and very expensive.
[0.1185455322265625] Though I found the hotel very pricey (for us) I'm sure you could get a much better rate on line.
[0.10974884033203125] We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.
[0.05144500732421875] Since we paid $210 for the night I thought we'd get free parking - we used the valet service for $28 (plus tips) which we found pricey also.

[-0.9844872951507568] Had a great internet deal we found on hilton.com for the website, so we were able to stay there for under $65 a night.
[-0.9687752723693848] I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
[-0.9518733024597168] My girlfriend and I got it for a great price.
[-0.472137451171875] Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.
[-0.33992862701416016] The hotel is very clean, the staff professional - and the food - simply amazing.

[0.017858505249023438] It was almost uneatable, but we were hungry.
[0.0034637451171875] Once coffee machine was used it was not replenished, even after a request to staff.
[0.0012664794921875] Breakfast was cold, room service was OK. As I'm writing this review, we've been without water - the entire hotel - for more than 3 hours.
[-0.0083465576171875] I could have spent less in the end and stayed somewhere else.
[-0.014509201049804688] On both nghts we have waited for 20 minutes or more for our drinks.
