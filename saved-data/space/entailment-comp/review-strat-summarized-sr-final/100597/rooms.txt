[0.368438720703125] Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.
[0.1703948974609375] Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room.
[0.04863739013671875] For an airport hotel, it was surprisingly quiet, rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared, and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous.
[0.034699440002441406] Plenty big, nicely kept bathrooms, bed was fairly comfy.
[0.03396034240722656] The beds were very comfortable, room large enough for wheelchair, and bathroom clean.

[-0.9635782241821289] Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.
[-0.9626636505126953] The crappy wings are old and the rooms smell musty.
[-0.9602012634277344] When we found our room we discovered that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and there were dirty towels lying around.
[-0.9557437896728516] Bathroom floors seems dirty and needed to be regrouted.

[0.131805419921875] Lovely spacious Doubletree, with gift shop and a very good restaurant inside it.
[0.1197509765625] The rooms in the wings are larger than those in the tower and if you get wings 2 or 3 closer than walking to the tower wing plus no elevator hassle.

[0.07074546813964844] The rooms are a good size, which is a bonus for me as I was traveling with my husband and two large teenaged sons in one room.
[0.063385009765625] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.

[-0.7197227478027344] Room was highly run down.
[-0.7081375122070312] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.

[-0.638092041015625] The tower rooms do have balconies but the space is shared with the room next door and divided by a set of austere looking bars--plus there is no furniture to sit on so the balconies are not really functional.

[0.026214599609375] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
