[0.8247451782226562] If you are coming late and/or leaving early at Sea-Tac, this is not a bad choice.
[0.2837867736816406] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[0.1568145751953125] Great location within view or shuttle ride from the airport.
[0.11602115631103516] This hotel was within a stone's throw of Sea-Tac airport and right next to the off-site Thrifty car rental lot, so for location, it was great.
[0.11371040344238281] When you need a hotel near the Sea Tac Airport, stay at the Doubletree and ride their shuttle.

[-0.19847488403320312] Have stayed at cheaper hotels with park n fly and they are always scary!

[0.802490234375] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.

[-0.886749267578125] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[-0.8392219543457031] ;) BAD: --YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PARK HERE.
[-0.791748046875] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!
[-0.7630233764648438] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.
[-0.7214221954345703] We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee.

[0.11895370483398438] This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking.

[0.3288402557373047] The only drawback was that the restaurant was a little on the pricey side for breakfast, but there are many places nearby to eat.

[-0.1415863037109375] The parking situation was a bit weird - we had a rental we needed to return and we were given 20 free minutes to unload and get the car out, but the rental return was next door, whcih was nice.
