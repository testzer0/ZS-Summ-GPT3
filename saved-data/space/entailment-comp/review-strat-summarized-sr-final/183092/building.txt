[0.8947982788085938] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[0.072662353515625] They also really need more than 1 elevator to the parking garage.

[-0.470916748046875] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[-0.2773017883300781] While there is a garbage strike going on, the city was still relatively clean and everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful.
[-0.23647308349609375] Everything was as expected, good check in, great location, nice room, good staff, etc....then about 11:00pm the fire alarms went off.
[-0.14165496826171875] Kensington Market and the Brewery District were the longest shlepps and those walks might not be for all, but we really enjoyed them and had fun detouring through the nearby neighborhoods.
[-0.11500930786132812] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!

[-0.995633602142334] We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.
