[0.3499755859375] The location was not great.
Parent: The reviewers said that the location was not that great because it was hard to find a parking spot and the staff was not very helpful.

----- Supporting -----

[0.3499755859375] You can self-park but being right downtown I figured it wasn't worth the hassle to save a few bucks.
[0.310577392578125] We were on the 9th floor facing West and the view was so-so, but to be honest I wasn't there for the view anyway.
[0.22576904296875] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.2049560546875] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended
[0.16228866577148438] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.

[0.8367691040039062] It was hard to find a parking spot.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8367691040039062] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
[0.7466049194335938] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[0.2686309814453125] Only down falll was $40.00 a night parking.
[0.25002288818359375] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.
[0.206451416015625] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9800949096679688] There are lots of parking lots near by that look cheaper than the hotel valet system (one right across the road).
[-0.9450759887695312] We had no trouble getting there - handy to Lakeshore Blvd.
[-0.8756561279296875] It is not that hard to match up numbers on tickets to find a vehicle.
[-0.851959228515625] We parked our car and never looked back because everything was within walking distance.
[-0.8210525512695312] You can pretty much walk everywhere in downtown.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7909660339355469] There was a slight mix up with our booking but no fuss was made although I did find the reception staff a little disinterested but nothing to spoil my stay.
[0.25060462951660156] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!
[0.13982009887695312] I would avoid the restaurant in the hotel as the service is slow and inconsistent.
[0.09920120239257812] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.
[0.06467819213867188] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.980402946472168] It was worth the cost of the parking just to have their assistance.
[-0.9618539810180664] Restaurant was really good too with great service!
[-0.9580707550048828] The rooms are equal to anything Hilton offers, the fitness facility is first rate and the restaurant staff are friendly and attentive - to the right degree.
[-0.9399847984313965] The second floor restaurant area was lovely and the service at breakfast could not have been better.
[-0.926116943359375] Great rates, Great location, friendly staff.

[0.970973014831543] The location is good for some attractions.
Parent: The location is good for some attractions, but it is not the nicest area of town and it is next to a noisy nightclub.

----- Supporting -----

[0.970973014831543] The location of the hotel is excellent for these attractions.
[0.9367656707763672] Location is good, close to nightlife, shopping, restaurants and Chinatown.

[0.00122833251953125] Didn't try the restaurant.
[0.0020885467529296875] Parking is valet only (would prefer the option to self park).
[0.0021333694458007812] I was able to jerk the system a bit by parking elsewhere and walking a couple blocks.
[0.002536773681640625] If you have a car, consider the cost of parking.

[0.9736900329589844] The location is not in the best area of town.
Parent: The location is good for some attractions, but it is not the nicest area of town and it is next to a noisy nightclub.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9736900329589844] The location was good for us but it is definitely not the nicest area of town.
[0.024715423583984375] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.
[0.01702880859375] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended
[0.01599884033203125] Parking rates are high as you will find in all major cities around the world.
[0.0086669921875] Not near a subway, but no need, we walked everywhere.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9480433464050293] It's right in the middle of the entertainment district which means you are near everything.
[-0.9424562454223633] Talk about the location & amenities - Location is very central with all major attractions close by - walked everywhere.
[-0.9311504364013672] We really enjoyed our stay here, it is in good location in the Entertainment district, and though we didn't try the restauant or breakfast it looked very good!

[0.4713134765625] The location is too close to a noisy nightclub.
Parent: The location is good for some attractions, but it is not the nicest area of town and it is next to a noisy nightclub.

----- Supporting -----

[0.4713134765625] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.275238037109375] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.270751953125] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.054595947265625] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.
[0.03475189208984375] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.

[-0.9957394599914551] Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.
[-0.9942886829376221] The hotel is close enough to the big attractions to be convenient but still is not in an overly busy/loud part of town which was nice.
[-0.9928548336029053] It is convenient to a nearby Shopper's Drug Mart (to pick up some in room snacks) and a large LCBO with a rather big Vintages section for some excellent wine for the room.
[-0.9891624450683594] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
[-0.9869728088378906] Surrounded by lots of restaurants and two less than two blocks from great shopping.
