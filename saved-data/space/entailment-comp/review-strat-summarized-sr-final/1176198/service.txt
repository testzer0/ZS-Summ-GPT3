[0.7032833099365234] The service was poor.
Parent: The accounts said that the service was poor, that the staff were unhelpful and unaccommodating, and that the hotel double-charged one of the guests.

[0.7032833099365234] Never in my life have I spent so much in one place and been treated so poorly.
[0.23430633544921875] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
[0.14498138427734375] First, there was absolutely no housecleaning/maid service!
[0.12441253662109375] They told us in a very rude tone and with attitude that our credit card had been declined over the last few days and that they had tried it several time so we would have to provide a cash deposit.
[0.0532684326171875] Also, the staff for some reason couldn't seem to do the sums right!

[-0.715789794921875] Not a bad place for _recreational_ travelers But the desk clerks could not figure out that for business travel, two people might have two reservations to share one room -- not, as the clerks set it up, for one to be the guest of the other (which also means no "HHonors" points for the "guest).
