[-0.9387788772583008] Definately recommend the property.
[-0.9308185577392578] The facilities are also better than I have encountered in any hotel.
[-0.9168262481689453] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[-0.9161057472229004] The great space for the pool and whirlpool is , without question, very impressive.
[-0.8988065719604492] Nice lobby with fresh cookies in the evening.
