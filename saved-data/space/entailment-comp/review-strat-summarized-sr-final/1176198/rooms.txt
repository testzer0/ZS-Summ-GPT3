[0.9755592346191406] I have stayed at this Hilton Garden on Peter street on business many, many times-so when planning a weekend visit with the family I had no hesitation to book- Its well situated, clean and modern and generally a very good value and the Hhnonors perks are good- WOW what a difference during the weekend-instead of business folk and tourists-its packed with club kids and partyers-the staff do their best-but its noisy and the area around the hotel is pretty crazy late in the evening on weekends- I will stay again during the week-but never on a weekend
[0.14633941650390625] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.
[0.12622833251953125] Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.
[0.0502777099609375] So, I can recommend the hotel, but please stay on the side where, hopefully, the base beat can't get you.
[0.0367279052734375] The week-end floozies everywhere and drunken partners are too much !
