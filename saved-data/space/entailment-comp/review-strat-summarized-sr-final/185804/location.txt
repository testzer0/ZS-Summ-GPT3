[0.5535316467285156] The location is an ideal jumping off point to some of the more interesting sites in Vancouver: Kitsilano, Jericho Beach, The Endowment Lands and Robson Street.

[-0.63555908203125] The island itself is lovely to wander around, and each day we bought either breakfast or a picnic lunch at the market.

[0.7191085815429688] Although the hotel has parking for a daily fee, it is best not to bring your car as the island is definitely best seen on foot and driving on the island is difficult as pedestrians are everywhere.
[0.590667724609375] Not the easiest to get to, but once you arrive you are set for the rest of your visit.
[0.2689056396484375] One of the drawbacks of staying on Granville Island is the parking - almost impossible at the weekend, even after paying the hotel $7 for a pass that allows you to park beyond the normal 3 hour limit.
