[-0.975494384765625] Unfortunately they just don't have the level of service that would make them a great hotel.
[-0.8894882202148438] The staff just seemed disinterested, especially at the bar and the front desk.
[-0.6900634765625] Initially they were less than courteous about it but i said if there is a charge of course i would play however it might be helpful for future guests to be escorted to the bike and given a brief safety instruction prior to giving someone a key.
