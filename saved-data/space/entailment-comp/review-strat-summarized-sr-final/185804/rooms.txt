[0.8302154541015625] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.

[0.9863901138305664] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.
[0.4197998046875] The marble tile floors in the rooms make for easy management of the pet-friendly policy, so I don't mark this hotel down for that as some other reviewers have mentioned.

[0.207794189453125] We had wished the room had a fridge that could be used rather than one stocked with liquor.

[0.0977325439453125] We only have two comments - we were planning on a "nightcap" when we got back from the theatre on a Saturday night at 10:30 - only to discover that both the dining room and the lounge were closed at this early hour.
