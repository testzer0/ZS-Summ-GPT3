[-0.8301925659179688] You walk on the carpet just feels so sticky.. About the location, compared to the other on celebrations area, seems not so close to those theme parks.
[-0.5720939636230469] Has to be the worst place I ever stayed.
[-0.5702800750732422] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
