[0.9608421325683594] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[0.5412139892578125] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[0.38880157470703125] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
[0.307373046875] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[0.30023193359375] We were disappointed about the hours of the Charlie Palmer and the bar downstairs but found an outstanding place to get a drink directly across the street.

[0.002002716064453125] This hotel has a very cramped feel.
[-0.0006389617919921875] The guest who remained were forced to go across the street to a dive bar where the b-day girl began to cry uncontrollably over her ruined special evening.
[-0.0016231536865234375] Had we been paying attention though, we could have asked for a room on the back side of the hotel when we made our reservation.

[0.6771087646484375] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.

[-0.9882206916809082] I stopped into Charlie Palmer for dinner, had a fantastic time there, Tommy the bartender took great care of me and the food was out of this world.
[-0.9841680526733398] Dinner at Charlie Palmer's was terrific and it finished with an anniversary card of sorts with a message spelled in chocolate at the top of our unbelievably rich Peanut Butter Bar - which btw, was practically a religious experience!
