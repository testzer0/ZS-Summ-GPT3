[0.4101524353027344] So overall I would recommend the hotel but just double check EVERYTHING on your invoice.
[0.2908916473388672] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[0.177032470703125] The housekeeper knocked on each door and handed out complimentary chocolates and bags of ice.
[0.15378189086914062] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.13880157470703125] Loved the rose prosecco too :-) the decor was really fun and innovative throughout, like the large moving cogs by the check-in desk or the chairs in the lobby with sliding silver tables attached, or the secret reading lamp on the guestrooms headboards.
