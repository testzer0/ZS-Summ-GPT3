[0.8761253356933594] The rooms were adequate.
Parent: The reviews said that the rooms were adequate but overpriced, that the view from the room was not great, and that the gym was in need of an upgrade.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8761253356933594] The room was spacious enough, with a big glass wall on the outside, a 42" flat screen TV, and terrific lighting arrangements that allowed you to adjust the brightness in various parts of the room.
[0.8607330322265625] The standard rooms are nice enough Overall, this is a fantastic hotel and certainly one of the best in SPG in North America.
[0.8267440795898438] The beds were comfortable, the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were pleasant and quiet even though it was crowded for the UT/OU game.
[0.8131217956542969] The hotel and guest rooms are cozy without feeling too small.
[0.678955078125] The rooms were fantastic, very clean, and had awesome showers!!!

[-0.9640846252441406] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9601173400878906] The gym is in desperate need of an upgrade.
[-0.9317855834960938] Didn't really bother us because it was laid out well but if we had been there a number of days and spent them in the room, it would have gotten cramped.
[-0.9304046630859375] The rooms are astonishing, my favorite detail in the entire room was the lights that are built into the headboard.
[-0.9034805297851562] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.

[0.4537086486816406] All in all, this hotel was nothing special with a high price tag.
[0.348846435546875] This hotel would have been adequate if the room price was much less.
[0.100982666015625] Very high end hotel that lived up to the hype.

[-0.89447021484375] The Joule is not luxurious in comparison and not sure why Starwood has it branded as such.

----- Supporting -----

[0.49169921875] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[0.13086700439453125] My only complaint about our room was that one side faced east and the bathroom window was not adequately covered so the morning sun lit up the whole room.
[0.1031646728515625] We complained and they just moved us to an even smaller room with the same view.
[0.07985687255859375] I can't get over the bathroom.
[0.0480499267578125] Well it started off BAD within 10 mins we had went to the pool where we find about 5 young ladies workin and just stood there looking like we where not even there, so I was like excuse me can I get a drink.

[-0.9902629852294922] The master bedroom was beautiful, comfortable and had great views of downtown Dallas.
[-0.9833717346191406] The room was just beautiful.
[-0.9812021255493164] An Infinity pool hangs over Main Street providing for a unique panorama of downtown Dallas.
[-0.9778556823730469] We reserved a guest room which was beautiful and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast on the patio Saturday morning at Charlie Palmer's Restaurant.

[-0.965087890625] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.9212417602539062] It was almost as if the hotel lobby and elevators were wearing cologne and it was a good scent but I am a little sensitive to scents so it was a little strong for me but was nice when walking in from the street.
