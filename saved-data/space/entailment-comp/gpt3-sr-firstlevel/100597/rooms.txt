[0.48688507080078125] We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied.
[0.4755363464355469] We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac.
[0.42945098876953125] Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport.
[0.3505439758300781] We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased.
[0.34113311767578125] Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9879288673400879] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.9835071563720703] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[-0.97930908203125] To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.
[-0.9646234512329102] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).
[-0.9602842330932617] This hotel disappointed.

[-0.9494609832763672] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
[-0.9364738464355469] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[-0.9146060943603516] The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare.
[-0.910888671875] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[-0.804901123046875] The tower rooms do have balconies but the space is shared with the room next door and divided by a set of austere looking bars--plus there is no furniture to sit on so the balconies are not really functional.

[0.5785140991210938] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.

Parent: Some reviewers noted that the hotel is near the airport, so it can be noisy at night.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9810695648193359] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.06195068359375] This hotel is by a small lake and at dusk there are misquitos and misc.
[0.0014448165893554688] We stayed at this hotel one night before an Alaska cruise.
[0.0009593963623046875] We spent the night in this hotel our last evening in Seattle before an 8 a.m. flight.

[-0.5726318359375] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[-0.457122802734375] Great for those early morning flights, and no worries about traffic jams as Seatac Airport is right across the street.
[-0.3944091796875] There are also other choices, with several restaurants and fast food places within a very short walk.

[-0.9984803199768066] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[-0.9981284141540527] The hotel is big and busy, so it always feels like there is some commotion going on in the common areas.
[-0.9977874755859375] --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
[-0.9968376159667969] The crappy wings are old and the rooms smell musty.
[-0.9966535568237305] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
