[0.9845600128173828] Staid here during Sakura-Con with a group of teens.
[-0.00047016143798828125] It was just a short walk to the mall where we got to ride the monorail to the Seattle center.
[-0.0015044212341308594] The A/C, no matter how low it was set, didn't keep the room very cool.
[-0.0021266937255859375] My companion and I stayed at this hotel because it was one of the most affordable on the day we went.
[-0.0027599334716796875] They just seem unsanitary to me.

[-0.9232063293457031] - The housekeeper walked in on me without knocking at 9 a.m. in the morning when I was getting ready to go in the shower.
[-0.5702972412109375] Don't know the concierges name, it would be the older man in the morning but he had great recommendations for restaurants, each one excellent and was so knowledgeable about the city and when was the best times to go to events.
[-0.2953338623046875] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
[-0.2164459228515625] The valet man was excellent.
[-0.1970367431640625] Not to mention when I checked in they yelled my room number out to me, not a good idea as a female travelling alone...
