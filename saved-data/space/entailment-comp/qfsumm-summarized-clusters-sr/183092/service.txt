[0.6483230590820312] The Marriott was a good hotel.
Parent: I stayed at the Marriott in mid-June for one night on a business trip .

----- Supporting -----

[0.6483230590820312] All in all, a very successful business trip by day and very comfortable nights at the Marriott.
[0.41173553466796875] The Marriott Eaton Centre provided service at its best.
[0.21277618408203125] The rest of my stay was great but definately need to get a new system in place for business travellers.. Id recommend Hilton Downtown or Marriott Airport Locations for Business Trips.
[0.10378074645996094] For a Downtown hotel, I would give this a 5 star for friendly and efficient service.
[0.08292388916015625] I stayed in this hotel as part of a large family group who travelled from Ireland to Toronto for a wedding, the management and staff were wonderful, this was not only about the facilities of the hotel but they were very helpful in guiding us where to go in Toronto and how to get there.

[-0.79705810546875] For business use the hotel gets a C, it was a poor service compared to the others.
[-0.295806884765625] It's a quick ride from the airport, and the bus lets you off at the Metropolitan Hotel about 2 short blocks away.
[-0.24608230590820312] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[-0.1408233642578125] Tip - the Toronto Airport Express shuttle bus is a cost-effective mode of transport from the airport to the city.
[-0.121185302734375] This really annoys me, enough that I will not stay there again in spite of the excellent service.
