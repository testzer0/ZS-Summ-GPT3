[0.9852476119995117] The fire alarm went off at 5.20 am.
Parent: Fire alarm at 5.20 am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant !

[-0.0031070709228515625] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!
[-0.011092185974121094] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..

[-0.06266021728515625] Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.
