[0.19073486328125] Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler.
[0.117645263671875] Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all.

[0.02587890625] FRONT DESK: Members of the front desk staff were extremely rude and condescending!!
[0.022430419921875] They also had a business center with free internet access for guests, so we were able to check our flight info, which was a big help.

[-0.9107933044433594] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.

[0.460845947265625] Staff lied that the bus system of Miami was very difficult to use when in fact it was more inexpensive and a lot easier than getting around w/ a taxi.
[0.41120147705078125] There Is a dedicated attendant in a booth working but she doesn't pick up her phone...what's the point.

[0.8037147521972656] We finally spoke to one front desk manager who compensated us for one nights stay because of our troubles.
[0.694366455078125] On the upside the manager bought us dinner and drinks at the restaurant for our inconvenience at check-in and he was very apologetic and nice.
[0.520721435546875] They would leave dirty glasses and leave new ones and they did not change the sheets.

[-0.7529830932617188] I feel the housekeeping staff is totaly at fault, and needs better supervision.
[-0.69219970703125] I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami.
