[0.062744140625] other than that the bathroom is not very private so if you want to preserve the "romance" factor you'll need to make a trip to the lobby because the ballroom level restroom is kept locked.
[0.0439453125] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
