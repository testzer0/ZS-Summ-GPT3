[-0.8871383666992188] My stay at the Magnolia around the corner for the preceding two nights was far more pleasant for $150 less a night.
[-0.7953376770019531] Trip to this hotel started off VERY poorly with a bungled reservation.
[-0.6158275604248047] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.5402412414550781] I stopped into Charlie Palmer for dinner, had a fantastic time there, Tommy the bartender took great care of me and the food was out of this world.
[-0.3875579833984375] Everything is good and after a Thursday night at the Ritz Bar, the PM lounge is your next best bet.

[0.851043701171875] It is clear this hotel has no loading dock or alley because while I was eating dinner at the award winning restaurant downstairs (Charlie Palmer's) I had big trucks pulling up within 10 ft of my table loading and unloading big crates of towels (I learned they outsource their linens) and other large pieces of equipment.
[0.788482666015625] This hotel does not have ice machines you have to call for ice well we called so we could have our own drink in room well lets say it NEVER CAME!!!!
[0.7635040283203125] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[0.666748046875] Stayed at the Joule for my anniversary with my husband.

[-0.780242919921875] Dinner at Charlie Palmer's was terrific and it finished with an anniversary card of sorts with a message spelled in chocolate at the top of our unbelievably rich Peanut Butter Bar - which btw, was practically a religious experience!
[-0.5669174194335938] parking was $10/day.
[-0.5487289428710938] parking is a bit expensive but what do you expect in downtown... we did find a parking garage a couple of blocks on elm street.
[-0.54583740234375] We went to the Joule as a treat for our anniversary.

[0.49863624572753906] This hotel has a very cramped feel.
[0.22997283935546875] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
[0.20891571044921875] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[0.07948112487792969] I was there on a Sunday and there's not much going on around that area, but they totally know that and offer a FREE shuttle to wherever you need to go.

[-0.8858566284179688] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.

[-0.478118896484375] We were disappointed about the hours of the Charlie Palmer and the bar downstairs but found an outstanding place to get a drink directly across the street.
