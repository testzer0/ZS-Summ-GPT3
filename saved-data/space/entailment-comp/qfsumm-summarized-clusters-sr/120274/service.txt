[0.420562744140625] The free shuttle to Disney is not worth taking.
Parent: Do n't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you 'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney !

[0.025421142578125] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
[-0.00498199462890625] STEER CLEAR!!
[-0.009441375732421875] It was very clean and our room was ok. the staff were very freindly and the only bad report that we have is with the shuttle busses.
[-0.0137939453125] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
