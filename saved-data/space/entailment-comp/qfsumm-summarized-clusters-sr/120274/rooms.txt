[-0.9849085807800293] I would not recommend this hotel really - it is very basic, so is the breakfast
[-0.9833965301513672] I have stayed at many 2 star hotels, but this one was the worst.
[-0.9797096252441406] It was just kind of old/dated & grimy!

[0.9860420227050781] We have been to Orlando five times.
Parent: This was our 5th visit to Orlando and our first budget trip and i have to say that this little gem of a hotel is far superior to other more expensive ones in the area .

[-0.00206756591796875] This place was a great base for a holiday where you spend most of your time out and about.
[-0.0021038055419921875] This hotel is great for a good value stay in Orlando when visting the theme parks.
[-0.0026006698608398438] A great place to stay.
[-0.0032281875610351562] The vast majority of the accommodation available in Orlando are motels and having stayed in many of them I would not say that this is the worst.

[-0.7949752807617188] This is passably the best deal in the WDW area I have been to WDW over 50 times staying everywhere from the Grand Floridian to the Gator Motel this is the best deal I have found the rooms were clean (they even steam cleaned the carpets mid week) we had a view of Expedition Everest from our room the housekeeping staff was thorough and friendly as well as the front desk attendants the continental breakfast was no more than doughnuts some muffins and toast juice, milk and coffee I was traveling with a 1 and a 3 year old and didn't have to worry about them crawling on the floor
[-0.7558135986328125] Yes I know there are fancier hotels in Florida, this was our third time and we have stayed in everything from a villa to a nice hotel on International drive.
[-0.6690483093261719] This is the 3rd time my family have stayed in this hotel & yes it does need a revamp & is a bit worn & tired but the staff are friendly & provide a good service.
[-0.6466903686523438] 3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .
[-0.6165390014648438] This was our second stay here, we were here previously in the summer of 2006 (it was Quality Inn Maingate West back then).

[0.0013370513916015625] Hotel was basic, 2* - no more.
[-0.0002002716064453125] The hotel is basic.
[-0.0008640289306640625] It was just a basic room.
[-0.0009479522705078125] We loved it, nothing fancy but nice.

[0.8242263793945312] In my opinion the hotel across the lake (Best Western Lakeside), which rates 18th, is no better than this hotel.
[0.77362060546875] An excellent budget motel, better than many in this area.

[0.4013671875] We booked with first choice and this seems to be there most budget hotel.............if you want better you'll have to pay for it i suppose, We wanted a cheap base to enjoy the local attractions but with that we also got a nice comfortable hotel room in a nice quiet area and everything was fineeeeeeeee.

[-0.9069309234619141] Bottom line - do yourself a favor: NEVER STAY at this flea bag of a hotel.
[-0.86798095703125] AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!
[-0.8096351623535156] There are plenty of other hotels down the same stretch in an equally good/better location so my advice is to chose them and not stay at the quality inn!
[-0.5390472412109375] I have stayed at many 2 star hotels, but this one was the worst.
[-0.5135269165039062] I would highly suggest spending more money to stay at a Disney property or a more expensive hotel.
