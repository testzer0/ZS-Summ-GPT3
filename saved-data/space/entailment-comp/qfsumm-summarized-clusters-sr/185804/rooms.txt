[0.6470947265625] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[0.05570220947265625] To get there, we took the quick little ferry from downtown, and walked with our rolling suitcases to the hotel, conveniently located and yet away from any traffic.
