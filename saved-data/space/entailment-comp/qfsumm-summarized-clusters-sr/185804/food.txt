[-0.1025390625] In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.
[-0.07762908935546875] Really rocking and that's not a bad thing eh :) But chasing down something to eat this late on the island was hopeless.
[-0.07632827758789062] so that when we bought food to bring back to the room, we had nothing to eat it with.
[-0.075042724609375] We needed to be able to provide some of our own food, so asked to have the mini bar emptied so we could use the fridge, and for a microwave, although it wasn't a regular part of the room.
