[-0.01081085205078125] Nice lobby.
[-0.01436614990234375] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[-0.0220184326171875] Relatively safe neighborhood in the "gay" area, but there were a few crazies walking the streets and some just high on drugs.
[-0.02911376953125] Be prepared to wait at least five minutes, and the doors sensors do not work, which was very annoying.
