[0.0896759033203125] The manager, Jeff, needs to learn a thing or two about customer service.
[0.06599807739257812] The staff at checkin was quick to notice our children were a little fussy and provided crayons and coloring books that calmed them right down, The room was huge complete with microwave and small fridge so we could warm up left over which is always important travelling with kids.

[0.48455810546875] The hotel books a lot of bus tours, and some mornings it can take a very long time to get an elevator, because they are being monopolized by the bus tourists, who are all trying to leave at once.
[0.01261138916015625] When I complained about the elevators and wireless he just stood there with no apology or good explanation other than it would be too expensive to fix the elevators and it was all the guests' fault anyway for the elevator getting stuck since there were 8 people in the elevator (it's rated for 12 people).
[0.008388519287109375] there's free - and mostly slow but functional - wireless internet access included in the room rate.
