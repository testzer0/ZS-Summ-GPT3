[0.9622325897216797] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[0.8359546661376953] Nice lobby with fresh cookies in the evening.
[0.207183837890625] Lobby is great for meeting friends and you can sit and chat there even if you don't want a drink.
[0.102294921875] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[0.039947509765625] The lobby has delicious cookies every afternoon.
