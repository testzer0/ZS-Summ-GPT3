[0.323486328125] He was very impressed and requested a tour of the brewery, which the brew-master provided for him.

[-0.8944931030273438] Bad Points * half renovated the common areas are nice, the bathrooms have no bath tubs but new bathrooms.
[-0.6260643005371094] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[-0.5913505554199219] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.59130859375] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[-0.21021270751953125] There is no easy chair.
