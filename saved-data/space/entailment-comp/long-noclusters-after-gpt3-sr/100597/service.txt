[0.398406982421875] Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.6053466796875] If I had been wanting to stay for more than one night, be close to anything interesting (other than the artificially created world of SEATAC), or wanted to get some business done, this would not have been the best hotel.
[-0.3154449462890625] She said all the blahblahblah and offered to change rooms, but I was halfway through my stay and changing rooms is a pain.
[-0.2786979675292969] We had to go searching for our check to pay it.
[-0.2748260498046875] If you use their free airport shuttle service, make sure you get on the right shuttle from the airport because there is another Double Tree with a separate shuttle.

[0.6832695007324219] The shuttle service to the airport ran frequently and was very convenient.
[0.6124229431152344] Shuttle service was very quick with plenty of buses on hand.
[0.5887451171875] If you don't want to wait, a good alternative is the nearby taxi stand; fare to the Doubletree should be less than $10 because of the hotel's proximity to the airport.
[0.4472618103027344] The shuttle runs 24 hours per day, and it makes about three trips per hour (no phone call or reservation is needed).
[0.43296241760253906] No need for a car, I got around just fine on the busses and the Rail.

[-0.83447265625] In fact, the free shuttle probably spends more time driving back to the hotel than it would probably take to just walk back across the street.
[-0.671722412109375] The shuttle getting from the airport to the hotel was very croweded and hot (yes hot for Seattle) and smelled.
[-0.49863433837890625] The internet fees are a HUGE scam-- $12-$15 for 24 hours.
[-0.3886260986328125] I was disappointed to learn there was a fee for parking ($16+tax), a fee for Internet ($5 for one hour), no simple breakfast included.
