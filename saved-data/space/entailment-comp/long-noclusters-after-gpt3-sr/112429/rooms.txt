[-0.9974188804626465] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !

[0.7719955444335938] The best included the cleanliness, the attention to detail with lighting and electrical outlets, the comfortable furniture, the robes, the great shower, the refrigerator, the windows can open, the wide and well lit hallways (although too warm) and of course an excellent king bed.

[-0.6337547302246094] Ok, it is bad.
[-0.4899444580078125] Beds comfortable but the windows seemed to have drafty gaps and the air conditioning unit on it let in outside air and sound as if it was an open window.

[-0.3231201171875] Definitely needed the curtains open by day.

[-0.9551925659179688] Rocked up to The Paramount Hotel not expecting much after a not so nice hotel experience in New York but boy was I wrong.
[-0.9443130493164062] The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.
[-0.9110794067382812] While it wasn't a bad room, and we would consider the hotel again if we were going to a concert, it certainly wasn't anything memorable.
