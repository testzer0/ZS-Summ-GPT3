[-0.22063827514648438] The choice of channels for the tv is terrible....for the amount you pay this place you should get more than 20 channels....the only thing great about this place is the water pressure.
[-0.10433197021484375] And don't pay more than $129/night for a room, there are better deals out there in the higher price range.
