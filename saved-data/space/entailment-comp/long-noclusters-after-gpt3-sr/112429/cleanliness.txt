[0.042072296142578125] The valet man was excellent.
[0.03692626953125] The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the decor in good taste (lots of texture, neutral tone, and rich burgandy to soothe the spirit).
[0.009000778198242188] Lolita was great as well.
[0.005633831024169922] Getting my car from the valet took less than three minutes... My stay at the Paramount was a very pleasant and positive experience.
[0.005535125732421875] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).

[-0.9928450584411621] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.
[-0.9762191772460938] The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.
[-0.9143867492675781] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.
[-0.8985509872436523] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[-0.87811279296875] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.

[0.020694732666015625] Don't know the concierges name, it would be the older man in the morning but he had great recommendations for restaurants, each one excellent and was so knowledgeable about the city and when was the best times to go to events.

[-0.8520355224609375] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.

[0.01169586181640625] I ended up with a very early morning arrival flight, and hoped that the hotel would hold my bags until check in since I had a meeting at 11am... they let me check into my room at 9:30am!

[0.1605987548828125] They use energy saving compact flourescent bulbs so the room was not very bright for reading.
[0.05426025390625] Wi-fi, however, was spotty in strength, and I frequently had difficulty maintaining a connection.

[-0.9734792709350586] We were also provided with free Wifi, which was great!
