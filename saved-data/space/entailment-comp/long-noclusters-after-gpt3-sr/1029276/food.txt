[0.1164398193359375] Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.

[0.190704345703125] We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.
