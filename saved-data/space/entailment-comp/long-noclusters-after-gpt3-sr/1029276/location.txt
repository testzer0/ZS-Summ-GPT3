[0.14639663696289062] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
[0.11042022705078125] Location was great 200 yds from Omni station for free Metro Mover + local bus station ($2 one way anywhere on route).
[0.0997314453125] Location is decent- fairly close to real downtown, very close to bus and train terminal for south beach etc.
[0.09307861328125] The location was good, very close to the Bayside area and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach.
[0.0334930419921875] It is in downtown Miami, so it makes sales calls very convenient for me.

[0.3817176818847656] The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun.
[0.256500244140625] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
[0.1446533203125] Close to a mall and generally well situated if you are in Miami for business.
[0.12170982360839844] The hotel is a three minute walk to the Metromover which will take you to Bayside in a couple of minutes where there is nightlife, shops, drinks, and restaurants.
[0.114715576171875] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.

[0.893463134765625] The rates were expensive.
Parent: Some reviewers found the rates to be expensive, but overall thought the hotel was acceptable for the price.

[0.893463134765625] This was an expensive option, but it was convenient since neither of us in the party was familiar with Miami.
[0.7597846984863281] Some tips: The parking is very expensive - $35 for valet and $25 for self-park.
[0.7200775146484375] Parking is super expensive, but that's Miami for you, at $28 per day.
[0.536346435546875] Valet parking was very pricy ($ 28) but very efficient.
[0.502349853515625] Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs.

[-0.9855890274047852] The restaurant inside the hotel had delicious plates and the breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and delicious.
[-0.9498367309570312] We booked via web and got a fair price last fall.
[-0.9494361877441406] Although - taking a tip from a previous poster - dine at the Bistro - 1/2 price on some of the appetizers and reasonably priced sandwiches.
[-0.9283218383789062] I received a discount for parking for my conference and paid only $12 dollars for two nights.
[-0.9128684997558594] Even though we booked on a discount site, we felt like important guests.
