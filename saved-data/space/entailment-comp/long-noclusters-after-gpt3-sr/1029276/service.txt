[0.9474811553955078] The Hilton is a good choice for business travelers.
Parent: Overall, reviewers thought the Hilton was fine for business travelers, with a great location near the airport and port.

[0.9474811553955078] Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler.
[0.1674346923828125] Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing.
[0.10935401916503906] Traveled to Miami in January for business and stayed at the Hilton Downtown because the conference was being held at the same hotel.
[0.038562774658203125] I stayed here one night on business, enjoying the $89/night rate they were advertising on their web site.
[0.030431747436523438] Front desk staffer was very nice, saw that I was a Hilton Honors Gold member and quickly informed me of the complimentary welcome reception and breakfast at the executive lounge.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.922119140625] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.
[-0.5402793884277344] I suggest the cab.
[-0.5241050720214844] Phone - don't go near it.
[-0.500732421875] The OMNI trainstation was only a block away.
[-0.344512939453125] Watch out for the unfortuneates in our society.

Parent: Overall, reviewers thought the Hilton was fine for business travelers, with a great location near the airport and port.

----- Supporting -----

[0.00461578369140625] They also had a business center with free internet access for guests, so we were able to check our flight info, which was a big help.
[0.0032253265380859375] I enjoyed staying here but I don't understand why there isn't free internet like in all other hotels I stayed in during my 3-week vacation.
[0.0031766891479492188] Overall, nice place to stay if you are in town on business.
[0.0027637481689453125] Give it 4 out of 5 for location, but 2 out of 5 for service.
[0.0019550323486328125] I stayed here one night on business, enjoying the $89/night rate they were advertising on their web site.

[-0.6693992614746094] Phone - don't go near it.
[-0.541595458984375] There were always taxi's at the hotel also that could bring us on a five minute trip to the beach!!
[-0.535491943359375] If you're visiting the med school, it's supposedly only 2.5 miles away - but it took me nearly half an hour to deal with the miami traffic - so either familiarize yourself the night before OR leave early enough to address the bumper to bumper traffic.

Parent: Overall, reviewers thought the Hilton was fine for business travelers, with a great location near the airport and port.

[0.12729644775390625] I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
[0.1067953109741211] The staff upgraded us to larger room, with a terrific view of the downtown and port.
[0.07931709289550781] The room was spacious and bathroom clean with great views over the bay and the breakfast was awesome, the staff throughout the hotel were very polite and helpful.
[0.045543670654296875] The front desk guy was nice enough to give us a room facing the bay after we requested it although what they had available was on the 4th floor.

[-0.2625160217285156] The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in.
[-0.2618827819824219] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.

**********

[0.9608650207519531] The rates were very high.
Parent: However, some found the rates to be very high, especially for breakfast, and felt that the hotel was not suitable for a holiday stay.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9608650207519531] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
[0.498260498046875] Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls.
[0.2313232421875] If you're visiting the med school, it's supposedly only 2.5 miles away - but it took me nearly half an hour to deal with the miami traffic - so either familiarize yourself the night before OR leave early enough to address the bumper to bumper traffic.
[0.1579437255859375] Second, my husband and I are both businesspeople, and to get wireless internet in our room, we were EACH charged $9.99 a day, even though their materials all say "wireless internet in your room for only $9.99 a day."
[0.136505126953125] Coming from Europe, it takes some time to get used to the "rip me off at every corner" culture in the States, but this was just going too far.

[-0.9781570434570312] Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all.
[-0.9750270843505859] Taking the train toward downtown is free and a five minute ride to the famous Bayside Marketplace --- which is a must do!
[-0.9723682403564453] Staff lied that the bus system of Miami was very difficult to use when in fact it was more inexpensive and a lot easier than getting around w/ a taxi.
[-0.9148521423339844] Wireless internet access is $9.95 which isn't bad by most comparisons.

[0.007953643798828125] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
[0.00269317626953125] We felt that an establishment of this nature in this location and carrying the Hilton brand should have made staff available to man the lounge at the times stated.
[0.0005702972412109375] Traveled to Miami in January for business and stayed at the Hilton Downtown because the conference was being held at the same hotel.
[-0.0033435821533203125] Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler.

[0.03266143798828125] I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami.
