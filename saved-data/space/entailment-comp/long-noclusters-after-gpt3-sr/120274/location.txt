Parent: The location of the hotel is a little out of the way for Universal, Prime Outlets (formerly Beltz), IDrive etc but it's only 5 minutes from Disney, you can see the top of Expedition Everest from the car park at the back!

[0.042266845703125] BUT personally i always stay clear of international drive as i find it quite run down and too busy............if you enjoy the 192 area of kissimee then this hotel is fine!
[0.022308349609375] You walk on the carpet just feels so sticky.. About the location, compared to the other on celebrations area, seems not so close to those theme parks.
[0.014451980590820312] It's not the best location as you do need to drive everywhere but that was all part of the fun for us!!
[0.010166168212890625] Not much, but you have to bring a quarter to fill your ice-bucket, annoying if you don't know this and have to walk back to your room to find change.
