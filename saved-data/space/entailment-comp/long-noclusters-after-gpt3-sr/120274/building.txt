[-0.8213272094726562] The furniture, i.e tv unit and clothes drawers seemed to be the only thing that seemed a little tired, but not so much that you would notice.

[-0.5345458984375] A must is a car because travelling around on foot is hard the roads are really hard to cross you take your life into your own hands and wait up to 15 mins for the lights to change and watch the traffic from the right because while your crossing they are too.
