[-0.94854736328125] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.

[0.6371955871582031] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.

[0.32012939453125] For some this may not be an issue, but also be aware, most rooms do not have bathtubs, just standup showers, so if you like to bath or have children who you need to bath, this is likely not the best choice.
