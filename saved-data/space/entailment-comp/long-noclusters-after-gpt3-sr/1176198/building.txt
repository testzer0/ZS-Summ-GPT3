[-0.3668212890625] How easy could it have been for someone else to leave with our truck if they could bring us the wrong car?
[-0.1330718994140625] We had to rent a car and travel back to US to have key made.
[-0.10359954833984375] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[-0.07132720947265625] The descriptions of the neighborhood other reviewers made in the past are correct: there are some questionable-looking people, but that is just one of the elements of any big city.
