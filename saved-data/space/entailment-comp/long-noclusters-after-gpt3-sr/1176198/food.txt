[-0.97344970703125] The dining option was reasonable and the food (dinner & breakfast) was ok. Actually, dinner was of better quality than I was expecting since this wasn't a full service Hilton.
[-0.40637969970703125] The only thing i would not recommend is eating at the hotel; with as many restaurants nearby, go out.
[-0.0636749267578125] My only complaint was that there were only two tiny creamers but enough coffee to make 4 cups.
[-0.016998291015625] There's good coffee nearby (I'm fairly sure that they didn't offer breakfast).
[-0.0035552978515625] So you can pack a couple of apples or muffins for later in the day and save yourself some more money on food!
