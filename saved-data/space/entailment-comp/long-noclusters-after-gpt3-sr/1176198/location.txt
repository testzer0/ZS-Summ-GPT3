[0.7286891937255859] Overall, the location was great.
Parent: Overall, reviewers thought the location was great.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7286891937255859] Location was fantastic.
[0.7146358489990234] The location was excellent, right across the street really from Theatres and Second City Comedy club.
[0.7023754119873047] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
[0.6829280853271484] We really enjoyed our stay here, it is in good location in the Entertainment district, and though we didn't try the restauant or breakfast it looked very good!
[0.6783657073974609] Great rates, Great location, friendly staff.

[-0.22503662109375] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[-0.0903167724609375] We were on the 9th floor facing West and the view was so-so, but to be honest I wasn't there for the view anyway.
[-0.0542755126953125] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[-0.029529571533203125] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[-0.02533721923828125] You can self-park but being right downtown I figured it wasn't worth the hassle to save a few bucks.

[0.6883468627929688] The hotel was new.
Parent: They liked that it was new and modern, and very clean.

[0.6883468627929688] I slept in many hotels downtown Toronto, and I can say this new Hilton hotel is the best one.
[0.14501953125] Fantastic location (OK they are renewing the old fashion district in the downtown core) but this hotel is quite wonderful !
[0.0621185302734375] Loved the area around this hotel, we had stayed around the Dundas area the previous week and this was much better.
[0.0571441650390625] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.
[0.03875732421875] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.6821975708007812] yet the restaurant had the same high quality as the big box Hilton.
[-0.455169677734375] Shopping district for shoppers out there.
[-0.253997802734375] It is not that hard to match up numbers on tickets to find a vehicle.
[-0.2168731689453125] Lot's of bars and restaurants nearby and plenty of local mini-markets for day to day necessities.
[-0.198699951171875] The rooms are equal to anything Hilton offers, the fitness facility is first rate and the restaurant staff are friendly and attentive - to the right degree.

[0.040252685546875] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.0345611572265625] We could walk to the CN Tower and Skydome as well as many restaurants, and the customers we were calling on were close by, so the location in Toronto was great for us.
[0.0322723388671875] Main attractions (CN Tower, Skydome) are less than 10 min walk, as they are all the theatre district amenities.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.961700439453125] It is convenient to a nearby Shopper's Drug Mart (to pick up some in room snacks) and a large LCBO with a rather big Vintages section for some excellent wine for the room.
[-0.76300048828125] Fantastic location (OK they are renewing the old fashion district in the downtown core) but this hotel is quite wonderful !
[-0.5124282836914062] The location was good for us but it is definitely not the nicest area of town.
[-0.4172515869140625] The first night was during the huge Caribe fest and it was crazy outside!

[-0.9685516357421875] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[-0.9060440063476562] Three of us stayed for two nights on a hectic trip, arriving on an overnight flight from the States.
[-0.8356246948242188] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.

[-0.9396839141845703] Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.

[0.093994140625] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended
[0.04388427734375] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
