[0.121673583984375] Rooms are attractive and well-appointed with super comfortable beds We were traveling light and didn't bring our laptops so the business center with free internet was a definite plus.
[0.1024627685546875] Not a bad place for _recreational_ travelers But the desk clerks could not figure out that for business travel, two people might have two reservations to share one room -- not, as the clerks set it up, for one to be the guest of the other (which also means no "HHonors" points for the "guest).
[0.04925537109375] There was a business centre, gym and pool, all of which were high quality.
[0.045139312744140625] Wireless internet was complimentary in the room which is great.
