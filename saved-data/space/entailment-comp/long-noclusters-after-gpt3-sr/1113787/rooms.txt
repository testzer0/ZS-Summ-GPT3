[-0.99700927734375] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.994746208190918] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[-0.9943485260009766] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.
[-0.9943256378173828] 2 - We stayed in the Demi-Joule room and it was very small.
[-0.9852218627929688] Although the room we were in was a bit small, they had really nice decor and details that you would not see a Marriott or a Hilton, IMHO.

[-0.965087890625] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.9212417602539062] It was almost as if the hotel lobby and elevators were wearing cologne and it was a good scent but I am a little sensitive to scents so it was a little strong for me but was nice when walking in from the street.
[-0.8143157958984375] The gym is in desperate need of an upgrade.
[-0.7385406494140625] Well it started off BAD within 10 mins we had went to the pool where we find about 5 young ladies workin and just stood there looking like we where not even there, so I was like excuse me can I get a drink.

[-0.9081573486328125] Didn't really bother us because it was laid out well but if we had been there a number of days and spent them in the room, it would have gotten cramped.

[0.9485883712768555] The bathroom was beautiful with a large soaking tub, a shower room and excellent lighting.
[0.7109718322753906] The rooms are astonishing, my favorite detail in the entire room was the lights that are built into the headboard.
[0.6676673889160156] When we got to our room it was very modern and high tech with all of the light switches and lamp knobs.
[0.654632568359375] My only complaint about our room was that one side faced east and the bathroom window was not adequately covered so the morning sun lit up the whole room.

Parent: The views from the room were not great, but the room itself was good.

----- Supporting -----

[0.14410400390625] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[0.0789031982421875] My only complaint about our room was that one side faced east and the bathroom window was not adequately covered so the morning sun lit up the whole room.
[0.0660858154296875] We complained and they just moved us to an even smaller room with the same view.
