[-0.9977154731750488] For business use the hotel gets a C, it was a poor service compared to the others.
[-0.9957208633422852] I was disappointed with the Internet service, though: $15 + $3 service charge daily, from noon to noon, with some interruptions.
[-0.9932036399841309] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.9928174018859863] The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all".
[-0.992767333984375] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.

[0.8793764114379883] I tried to hook up my computer to the internet in the room afterwards, but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue.

[-0.04571533203125] One is my usual complaint of charging the exhorbitant fees for internet access in the guest rooms...this drives me crazy that I can go to a Holiday Inn Express and get free wireless internet in my room but the higher end hotels charge for it.

[-0.23474884033203125] toronto air express bus to airport was fast - take a $10 cab to get picked up at westin then $20 to take bus - o/w will sit on bus for 40 minutes before you even leave for the airport (still better than $60 taxi).

[-0.15726089477539062] I should note that the Airport Express bus does not list the Marriott as one of its downtown stops, however one of its stops (the Metropolitan Hotel) is only a block or so from the Marriott.
[-0.14977264404296875] My only quibble would be that the business centre charged $3 for 5 minutes of computer time, but if you brought your own laptop, you could use it for free in the lobby.
