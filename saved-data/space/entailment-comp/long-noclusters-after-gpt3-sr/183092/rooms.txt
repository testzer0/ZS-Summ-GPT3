[0.886749267578125] The rooms at this hotel are satisfactory.
Parent: The rooms at this hotel are well-done and up to Marriott's usual standards, but they are not luxurious.

----- Supporting -----

[0.886749267578125] The rooms are spacious and beds very comfortable, unfortunately there was no bottled water in the room which was disappointing given the hotel standard but this is my only downside of the stay.
[0.8441848754882812] The hotel is very clean, the rooms were a good price for the quality received, and, best of all, the location can't be beat.
[0.8191986083984375] Overrall, my room was a comfortable place to spend some time (I liked the large flat panel tv), while the rest of the hotel was unexciting.
[0.7754592895507812] The rooms were Marriott quality with all the requisite amenities you would expect.
[0.7688751220703125] This is a renovated Marriott with an above average lobby and room.

[-0.9819011688232422] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
[-0.9371471405029297] During our recent trip we stayed in 5 hotels in Canada and this was by far the worst.
[-0.9225006103515625] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.
[-0.9154510498046875] While the beds were comfy and we had plenty of room, the guest rooms are in need of a renovation.
[-0.9041366577148438] It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.
