[-0.9529953002929688] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[-0.9516105651855469] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.

[0.08988189697265625] The staff at checkin was quick to notice our children were a little fussy and provided crayons and coloring books that calmed them right down, The room was huge complete with microwave and small fridge so we could warm up left over which is always important travelling with kids.
[0.05015754699707031] My other reason for choosing this hotel was the fact that they have free wireless internet access which was much needed.
[0.032115936279296875] There was also a business room where you could enjoy free internet and use of the fax and printer.
[0.03200531005859375] Great wi-fi service too.
[0.027925491333007812] Hotel has free wireless internet that I used in my room and in the Lobby that worked well.

[-0.40839385986328125] It was so slow it was practically useless.
[-0.407470703125] It was built using cheap consumer-grade access points instead of business grade ones that are more reliable and can be centrally managed.

[-0.012385368347167969] I was just on a business trip and because of circumstances had to stay at the Primrose for one night before I came back to the States.
[-0.013222694396972656] From the time we got our parking permit until the time we checked out we had nothing but polite staff.

[-0.017353057861328125] Well I was wrong.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8924646377563477] We got an excellent rate because we were doing business in the hotel.
[-0.8444747924804688] Many places I visit charge ridicules rates for internet so the fact it was free was great.
[-0.786865234375] The wireless Internet, while free, is not even worth that price.
[-0.5986404418945312] When I complained about the elevators and wireless he just stood there with no apology or good explanation other than it would be too expensive to fix the elevators and it was all the guests' fault anyway for the elevator getting stuck since there were 8 people in the elevator (it's rated for 12 people).

[-0.9108161926269531] The hotel books a lot of bus tours, and some mornings it can take a very long time to get an elevator, because they are being monopolized by the bus tourists, who are all trying to leave at once.
[-0.8488731384277344] You'll get on for a couple minutes and then it will flake out and you'll spend the next 10 minutes trying to reconnect.
[-0.7713851928710938] In my entire life, I have never been treated in such a rude, disrespecting manner.
[-0.609954833984375] The problem is you do not see where your box is being placed and how it is secured.
