----- Supporting -----

[-0.02254486083984375] Although it would have been more convenient for me to stay at the hotel the meeting was in, their prices were far too expensive for my budget.
[-0.029266357421875] The price is very good and the rooms are large, the only issue with the hotel is its very dated and could do with a revamp.
[-0.033855438232421875] The price was good and they had a room with a king bed open.
[-0.03416252136230469] If you are looking for an expensive four or five star hotel, don't stay here.
[-0.03579521179199219] The location was good, right where I needed to be, and the price was great for downtown and I only paid $89 with a corporate discount.
