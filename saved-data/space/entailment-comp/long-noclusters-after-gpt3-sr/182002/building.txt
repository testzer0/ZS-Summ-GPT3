[0.003009796142578125] Nice lobby.
[0.0015506744384765625] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[0.0011444091796875] Tim Hortons right in the lobby which was very convenient.
[0.00034332275390625] They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting.
[-0.00012969970703125] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!

[0.571197509765625] I saw some work being done in the lobby and wonder if they also did the rooms as our furniture looked to be new and had no damage or wear you normally see.
[0.0262451171875] It was quickley rectified and someone brought me a new iron within minuets.
