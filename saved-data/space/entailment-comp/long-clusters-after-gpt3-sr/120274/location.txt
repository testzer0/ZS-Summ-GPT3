[0.9564094543457031] The parking lot was clean, the location of the hotel was GREAT (right next to many restaraunts, souvenier shops, and within 5 minutes to the Disnet World Parks).
[0.9555215835571289] On a better note... the hotel is in a good location and just down the road is a cafe thing where you can get an all you can eat buffet breakfast for very cheap, which served loads of fruit, cakes, a fry up, pretty much anything.
[0.953824520111084] The location couldn't be better and there are lots of restaurants around the hotel.
[0.920684814453125] Fantastic location wit restaurants, gift shops etc all within walking distance of the hotel (I did the whole thing on foot as I don't drive).
[0.9199743270874023] The hotel is actually in a good position on the 192 highway, really near to disney & close to lots of good places to eat - red lobster was the best it was just across the road.

[0.0923919677734375] Although this is by no means a luxurious residence, it is a perfect place to stay if you are intending to visit the theme parks, although a car is essential.
