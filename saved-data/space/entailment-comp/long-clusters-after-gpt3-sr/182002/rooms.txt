----- Supporting -----

[0.6754341125488281] The elevators are very small, it is cramped with 4 people with luggage.
[0.3011741638183594] The elevators are very small, so getting a cart and two bodies into the tight space was a difficult.
[0.00690460205078125] The biggest disappointments were: -Elevators (being "updated", bumpy ride, not reliable-ended up on a floor we didn't know we could access!)
[0.004253387451171875] The elevators were very scary and one was constantly being repaired.
[0.002498626708984375] My suggestion for the hotel though is try to get a room away from the elevator.

[0.8919143676757812] The non-free continental breakfast is a joke.

[-0.9682884216308594] Excellent breakfast in the AM as well.
[-0.9400863647460938] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
