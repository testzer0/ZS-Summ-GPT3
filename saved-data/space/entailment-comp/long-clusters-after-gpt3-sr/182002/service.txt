[0.3511505126953125] The reviews were bad.
Parent: The reviews were mostly negative, citing poor customer service, unreliable elevators and wireless internet, and a general feeling that the staff were only interested in money.

----- Supporting -----

[0.3511505126953125] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.3209991455078125] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.

[0.1614227294921875] The staff were rude and quite useless, they just seemed annoyed and unwilling to help no matter how polite we were.

[0.4879302978515625] One front desk was outright rude and unhelpful for several requests which had to be handled by a morning person who was confused why the evening staff wouldn't help me until I told her the staff name and she rolled her eyes and suggested I speak with management.

[0.236297607421875] When I complained about the elevators and wireless he just stood there with no apology or good explanation other than it would be too expensive to fix the elevators and it was all the guests' fault anyway for the elevator getting stuck since there were 8 people in the elevator (it's rated for 12 people).
[0.131134033203125] The hotel books a lot of bus tours, and some mornings it can take a very long time to get an elevator, because they are being monopolized by the bus tourists, who are all trying to leave at once.
