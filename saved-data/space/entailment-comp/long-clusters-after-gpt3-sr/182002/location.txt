[-0.7888870239257812] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.
[-0.707305908203125] The underground parking is horribly laid out.

[-0.29393768310546875] THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.
[-0.19722938537597656] If you have a van or larger vehicle forget parking here.
[-0.176727294921875] Our room was good, the bed very good - but it was disappointing to find that the "new and exciting Primrose Restaurant and Bar where no expense had been spared" (according to their brochure) was CLOSED except for breakfast time.
[-0.17156219482421875] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).

[0.9685478210449219] The location was close to a mall.
Parent: The location was good for some people, being close to restaurants, a mall, and other attractions.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9685478210449219] The place was in a good location and I was able to walk to a huge mall and what I guess is Torontoâ€™s equivalent of Times Square.
[0.7020149230957031] Close enough to walk to the Eaton Centre.
[0.46848297119140625] The location was perfect as I walked to the Eaton Centre which was about 10 minutes away, and then the cab ride back only cost $8 including a tip.
[0.3995361328125] There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.
[0.1595306396484375] This hotel is near everything; subway, restaurants, shopping.

[-0.8582611083984375] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
[-0.8105087280273438] Heed this warning stay away from this crappy place, you'll be glad you did.
[-0.8012771606445312] The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car.
[-0.740692138671875] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[-0.6162185668945312] The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out.

[0.16709136962890625] The next day when we moved into the garage the attendant said we should never have parked in the previous location because everyone should know that your car would be a target there.

[0.9347658157348633] Parking is expensive.
Parent: However, others found the location to be less than ideal, with expensive parking and difficult to find public parking.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9347658157348633] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.8052806854248047] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[0.7900047302246094] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.7342147827148438] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.6476936340332031] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.48627471923828125] The best thing about the room was its view.
[-0.38556671142578125] They were also kind enough to recommend and make reservations at a lovely restaurant called Ruth Chris (pricey but well worth it if you are a steak lover).
[-0.3219470977783203] There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.
[-0.30146026611328125] The hotel was in a good location and it was easy to get a cab just outside the hotel to the clubs.
[-0.259246826171875] The window looking at a fantastic view north was so grimy it was hard to see through (finger and nose prints all over it) We just kept the net curtains closed so we couldn't see them and enjoyed the night lights instead.

[-0.46478271484375] The best thing about the room was its view.
[-0.422882080078125] The one good thing that came about from our stays at this hotel was finding The Golden Greek Restaurant which is in the lower part of the building next door.
[-0.32777976989746094] The subway station is only a few blocks away and the street car passes right in front of the hotel.
[-0.3126964569091797] The Hotel is in walking distance to most major attractions and the public transportation is easily accessible.
[-0.3113250732421875] We were on the 22nd floor and the view was to die for.
