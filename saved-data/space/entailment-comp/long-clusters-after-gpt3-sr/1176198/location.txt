[0.7712945938110352] This hotel is in walking distance to most of the downtown attractions such as the CN Tower, Queen St, Front St, even Wayne Gretzky's restaurant is right down the street.
[0.7614316940307617] The hotel is in a good location, central and easy to walk from - the Art Gallery of Ontario is well worth a visit.

[-0.21660995483398438] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[-0.16398239135742188] From the airport got a car that seated 5 people and luggage and cost $65 which we didn't think was too bad - took about 25 minutes.
[-0.15780258178710938] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[-0.137725830078125] Another thing is try to avoid the public parking across the hotel.
[-0.12762451171875] The accessible room was just that - very accessible.

[-0.17761993408203125] I would avoid the restaurant in the hotel as the service is slow and inconsistent.
[-0.16994476318359375] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[-0.16852569580078125] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.

[0.9712333679199219] Parking was an issue.
Parent: They also said that parking was an issue and that the nightclub next door could be loud.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9712333679199219] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
[0.9423913955688477] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[0.7894058227539062] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[0.6864852905273438] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.
[0.611907958984375] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended

[0.26922607421875] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.

[0.00797271728515625] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9732487201690674] There was an event on at the nightclub one night and I never heard anything.
[-0.8589744567871094] Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.
[-0.7345161437988281] It is convenient to a nearby Shopper's Drug Mart (to pick up some in room snacks) and a large LCBO with a rather big Vintages section for some excellent wine for the room.
[-0.5620250701904297] Close to lots of restaurants, a Whole Foods and two streetcar lines making it easy to get around.
