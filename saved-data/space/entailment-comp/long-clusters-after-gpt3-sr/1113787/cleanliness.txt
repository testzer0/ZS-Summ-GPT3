[-0.983607292175293] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.555328369140625] Loved the rose prosecco too :-) the decor was really fun and innovative throughout, like the large moving cogs by the check-in desk or the chairs in the lobby with sliding silver tables attached, or the secret reading lamp on the guestrooms headboards.
[-0.5464019775390625] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.34212493896484375] I know this could happen anywhere but in years of valet parking it hasnt so this was quite annoying.
[-0.32677459716796875] I had a rather loud banging on my door to find a maid who said (Who spoke little english) 'downturn you have ice".
