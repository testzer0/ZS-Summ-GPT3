[0.40612030029296875] The rooms are awesome except for the lack of privacy in the toilets that others have mentioned.
[0.067230224609375] They finally were ok with the outside food once they realized we were NOT moving it and were still quite unhappy about the pool situation.
[0.06249237060546875] The Joule really is a gem and I would return but probably would opt for a different room catogory
[0.0573883056640625] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[0.0518951416015625] There was a mix-up with an upgrade for our room, but that was the only disappointment with our stay.

[-0.49616241455078125] The room was immaculate - superbly decorated, super clean, and there was a complimentary bottle of champagne for us, with truffles and a lovely note from the manager.
[-0.4447021484375] Our tweens loved the salt water heated infinity pool, the Charlie Palmer bar, awesome room service and gorgeous room......we live in Carrollton, but felt we had traveled to another luxurious country!

[0.9703130722045898] The rooms were spacious.
Parent: Some found them to be spacious and well-appointed, while others found them to be small and lacking in amenities.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9703130722045898] The room was spacious enough, with a big glass wall on the outside, a 42" flat screen TV, and terrific lighting arrangements that allowed you to adjust the brightness in various parts of the room.
[0.9552888870239258] absolutely beautiful property, rooms are spacious and modern, roof-top pool area is excellent, and restaurant is 5-star.
[0.9393043518066406] The Joule Suite was classy, comfortable and spacious.

[0.640380859375] The hotel and guest rooms are cozy without feeling too small.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.99700927734375] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.994746208190918] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[-0.9943485260009766] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.
[-0.9943256378173828] 2 - We stayed in the Demi-Joule room and it was very small.
[-0.9852218627929688] Although the room we were in was a bit small, they had really nice decor and details that you would not see a Marriott or a Hilton, IMHO.

[0.9872159957885742] Rooms are very well appointed.
[0.9730243682861328] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".
[0.9530925750732422] The room was beautifully appointed with a round bed, bvlagari amenities, rainfall shower, and oversized flat screen.

[-0.7784347534179688] The gym is in desperate need of an upgrade.

[-0.67889404296875] The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars (if I could it would be 4.75) on "Service" is b/c they weren't so timely on pre-arranged room service...we asked for it by a certain time and it arrived about a half hour later.
[-0.6485214233398438] I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.

[0.34552001953125] (Not Four Seasons, Not Zaza, Not The Crescent) Get my point?
[0.3233489990234375] The Joule is not luxurious in comparison and not sure why Starwood has it branded as such.
[0.313751220703125] Not only was no one swimming in the pool - but all of the "beautiful people" - I assume from the evening's party - were still hanging around in cocktail dresses and sportcoats.
[0.202606201171875] The pool was too chilly for the kids to spend much time in it, but that isn't surprising for this time of year.

[-0.9979915618896484] Everything from room service from the top Charlie Palmer restaurant in the hotel 24/7, plus the stunning gorgeous pool, amazing rooms, etc, etc.

[0.8164215087890625] The hotel is very posh and modern.
[0.5927276611328125] Everything from the lobby to the rooftop pool has a very modern look.
[0.575592041015625] The Joule has a modern feel kind of like the W but it is warmer feeling and more comforatble than the W. The pool at the Joule is amazing and is actually where they film the outdoor bar scenes for ABC's The Deep End which is the show is set in LA but is actually filmed in Dallas.
[0.55078125] Very contemporary hotel but classy.

[0.4537086486816406] All in all, this hotel was nothing special with a high price tag.
[0.348846435546875] This hotel would have been adequate if the room price was much less.
[0.100982666015625] Very high end hotel that lived up to the hype.
