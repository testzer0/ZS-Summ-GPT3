[0.9829516410827637] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
[0.8477706909179688] Construction was happening on the exterior of the hotel.
[0.6791229248046875] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.1230926513671875] And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor.
[0.0274658203125] Hotel could do with a refurbishment.
