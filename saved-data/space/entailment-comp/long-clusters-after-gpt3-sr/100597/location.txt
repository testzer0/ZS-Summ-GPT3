[-0.7302560806274414] We were told we had a great view of the "lake" from our room.

[-0.9370384216308594] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[-0.8669881820678711] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.
[-0.8453245162963867] Shame on you Doubletree for charging your own guests to pay to park on your site during their stay.
[-0.8127613067626953] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!
[-0.746795654296875] We purchased the Park and Fly Package and were very happy to discover that this package included valet parking for our car directly out front of the hotel, not off in a back parking lot or at an off site location like many other hotels.

[-0.9408187866210938] When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that.
[-0.9283771514892578] Be sure to have your receipt for parking from the front desk (i did thanks to previous posts) or you won't be able to get your car.

[0.7308807373046875] Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed watching airplanes takeoff and land, and this hotel provides an eagle's eye view of the airport (unless you're on the east side of the tower, in which case you're stuck looking at the snowcapped Cascades and/or Mt Rainier).
