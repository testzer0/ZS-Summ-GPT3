[0.30330467224121094] The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms.
[0.18827438354492188] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
[0.024623870849609375] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
[0.023876190185546875] It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.
[0.008813858032226562] The tower elevators, which run on the exterior of the building, were quite cold.
