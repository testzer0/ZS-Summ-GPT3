[0.42945098876953125] Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport.
[0.3505439758300781] We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased.
[0.34113311767578125] Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor.

[-0.9879288673400879] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.9835071563720703] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[-0.97930908203125] To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.
[-0.9646234512329102] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).
[-0.9602842330932617] This hotel disappointed.
