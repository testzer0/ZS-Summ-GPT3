[-0.9960479736328125] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.
[-0.9913663864135742] My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.
[-0.9655303955078125] While the beds were comfy and we had plenty of room, the guest rooms are in need of a renovation.
[-0.9586524963378906] The toilet did not flush properly and the shower seemed to have only 2 temperatures: scalding hot or freezing cold.
[-0.94439697265625] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.

[0.9719314575195312] The rooms are spacious and beds very comfortable, unfortunately there was no bottled water in the room which was disappointing given the hotel standard but this is my only downside of the stay.

[0.9503135681152344] The property looks recently renovated, and the room was spacious and comfortable.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9857292175292969] The effect in the small room was to feel as if the ceiling and walls were closing in on us.
[-0.9338836669921875] We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds ( 04 people ) and it was not so comfortable as we are used to sleep in a King Size bed back home.
[-0.91693115234375] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!

[0.9356002807617188] (1) Location of the hotel is ideal , my wife was thrilled as it was within short walling distance to the Eaton center one of the largest shopping centers in Toronto (2) Room is spacious compared to other 4 star hotels, good furniture, clean and neat (3) Good entertainment with LCD 37 inch TV with on demand movies and more (4) Staff are friendly and professional, good staffing numbers very adequate (5) Breakfast was great and included in the price of around US$ 200 per night , very fair price for this hotel, the breakfast included fresh fruits (Produce of Canada) and eggs and an egg station and many other delights
[0.9273109436035156] Overrall, my room was a comfortable place to spend some time (I liked the large flat panel tv), while the rest of the hotel was unexciting.
[0.509918212890625] Excellent rate of 3 nights for the price of 2 provided a huge room with ample storage facilities, Plasma TV and safe.
[0.13511276245117188] The hotel is marvelous, their renovations are complete and they did a wonderful job, we had a room with king bed, great tv in the room and it was a very spacious room.

[-0.6880264282226562] The pool didn't have a shallow end for small children, so if you have a younger child you have to hold them the whole time.

[-0.6306896209716797] Pool glass enclosed walls to see city from high up floor (top?).

[-0.5025901794433594] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.

[0.7372207641601562] The beds at the Marriot were SO comfortable I would have been ok with just lounging in bed all weekend and never seeing the rest of city!
[0.6227340698242188] This hotel was a nicer style than most and ranked up there with the downtown waterfront Seattle Marriott for style and a cool bar to chill at in the lobby.
[0.5636367797851562] The hotel is marvelous, their renovations are complete and they did a wonderful job, we had a room with king bed, great tv in the room and it was a very spacious room.

[0.9868602752685547] The rooms facing the office building did not have much privacy.
Parent: However, some reviewers noted that the rooms facing the office building did not have much privacy.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9868602752685547] Also a lot of the rooms face an office building, so theres not much privacy, because the curtains are very easily seen through, but overall if your willing to pay over 250 a night, your really only paying for the location and the walkway to the mall.
[0.009801864624023438] However, the rooms are very average (no safe, mini-bar for example).
[0.00855255126953125] Then hard to get out as Mcguinty crew in town and elevators shut down once again.
[0.00787353515625] You would think the 4 elevators would be empty at that hour.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.964259147644043] The beds were nice and we had a view of the church next door.
[-0.9358901977539062] Because the hotel backs onto a small courtyard, you could not hear any street noise.
[-0.7417259216308594] One of the things that make people willing to pay a lot of money for this place is because the hotel has a walkway that goes right into the eaton centre mall.
[-0.7119293212890625] There are tons of excellent restaurants close by for pretty much every taste and budget.
[-0.7003402709960938] The room was a good size and looked out over the church next door, plus it was useful to be able to go straight through into the Eaton Centre.
