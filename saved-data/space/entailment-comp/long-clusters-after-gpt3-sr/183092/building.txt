[0.935603141784668] The lobby was modern with a beautiful fireplace and a good breafast/coffee/drinks bar too.

[0.8574237823486328] Modern facility, quiet.

[-0.1542816162109375] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.

[0.8345327377319336] We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.
