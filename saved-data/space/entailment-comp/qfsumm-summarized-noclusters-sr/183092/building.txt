[-0.0042266845703125] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[0.037540435791015625] The phone system in some of the rooms was not functioning properly.

[0.037540435791015625] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..

[-0.00015163421630859375] The lobby refurb looked great -- now they just need to tackle some of the older rooms.

[-0.108673095703125] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[-0.10009002685546875] From the moment we walked in the door we felt welcomed and comfortable.
[-0.0791778564453125] Its a pretty cool thing to be able to walk right into torontos biggest mall in just two minutes.
