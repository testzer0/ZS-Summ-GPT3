[0.07348251342773438] It think it may also be the most expensive of all of the Toronto Marriott hotels.
[0.06499671936035156] Unlike many other hotel breakfasts, this one actually has good food!
[0.04218292236328125] I felt that the hotel wisely focused on things we needed, like a coffee/tea maker, black out curtains, and a daily newspaper, while eliminating the nonessentials like mini-bar and robes.
[0.03874969482421875] We had breakfast and lunch at the Parkside restaurant in the hotel, the food was of a very high standard, and children less than three eat free ( it costs $7.95 for children over three for the breakfast buffet).
[0.03735637664794922] The rooms are large and the food in the dining room is decent enough.
