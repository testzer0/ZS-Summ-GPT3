[0.3646240234375] The customer service person was quite apologetic and told me that she would see what she could do.
[0.3634033203125] Called the front desk and they sent security.

[-0.9269943237304688] They quickly cancelled the 2nd reservation once they realised the situation, no questions asked.
[-0.83837890625] Our housekeeper was excellent and expressed her appreciation for the tip we left.
[-0.596923828125] All staff that we dealt with were courteous and professional.
[-0.57550048828125] I would often try to tip them, sometimes $20, but they always refused, stating that it was against hotel policy and that it was "part of the service".
[-0.52880859375] The staff at the hotel were polite and helpful at all times.

[0.0125579833984375] When we arrived at the hotel, there was nobody available to get our bags.

[-0.0004425048828125] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[-0.012033462524414062] The only slight knock I have is that the airport shuttle doesn't stop at this hotel.

[0.4244270324707031] The Marriott is a good hotel.
Parent: I stayed at the Marriott in mid-June for one night on a business trip .

----- Supporting -----

[0.4244270324707031] All in all, a very successful business trip by day and very comfortable nights at the Marriott.
[0.2586822509765625] The Marriott Eaton Centre provided service at its best.
[0.170867919921875] The rest of my stay was great but definately need to get a new system in place for business travellers.. Id recommend Hilton Downtown or Marriott Airport Locations for Business Trips.
[0.11625480651855469] For a Downtown hotel, I would give this a 5 star for friendly and efficient service.
[0.08969306945800781] I stayed in this hotel as part of a large family group who travelled from Ireland to Toronto for a wedding, the management and staff were wonderful, this was not only about the facilities of the hotel but they were very helpful in guiding us where to go in Toronto and how to get there.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.80474853515625] For business use the hotel gets a C, it was a poor service compared to the others.
[-0.384552001953125] It's a quick ride from the airport, and the bus lets you off at the Metropolitan Hotel about 2 short blocks away.
[-0.15673446655273438] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[-0.1275482177734375] Tip - the Toronto Airport Express shuttle bus is a cost-effective mode of transport from the airport to the city.
[-0.12673187255859375] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
