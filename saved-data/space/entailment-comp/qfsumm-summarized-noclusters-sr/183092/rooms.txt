[0.06497001647949219] The phone system in some of the rooms was not working properly.
Parent: The issue I had is that the phone system in some of the rooms was not functioning when I checked in .

[0.06497001647949219] I was happy to get this hotel for $159/night - though internet was slow and added $16 dollars per day (though it included all calls - or so i thought until i got my bill and they had charged me $40 worth of long distance calls - they were promptly removed).
[0.05698394775390625] A few minutes later this person came to my room and handed me a key to another room that happened to have its line fixed already for that night.
[0.0003032684326171875] Compared to my last stay, my room was a little disappointing.
[0.0001068115234375] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
[0.0] Finally I called at midnight to insist on another room which they gave me.

[0.928558349609375] The beds at the Marriot were SO comfortable I would have been ok with just lounging in bed all weekend and never seeing the rest of city!
[0.5733642578125] The hotel was clean and modern and the King room was spacious, with the most comfortable bed (slept better than at home).

[-0.885528564453125] My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.

[0.1514892578125] The internet connection in the room was not working.
Parent: I tried to hook up my computer to the internet in the room afterwards , but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue .

----- Supporting -----

[0.1514892578125] I was happy to get this hotel for $159/night - though internet was slow and added $16 dollars per day (though it included all calls - or so i thought until i got my bill and they had charged me $40 worth of long distance calls - they were promptly removed).

[-0.5889205932617188] The Downtown Marriot is good for exploring the city since everything is within walking distance (if you do not mind to walk a bit across a city which I think is the best way to get the vibe of a city).
