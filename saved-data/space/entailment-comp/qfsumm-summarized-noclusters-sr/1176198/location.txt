[0.26190185546875] The maid service was not timely.
Parent: We were there for 4 days / 3 nights and every day we had to track down a maid to request clean towels .

----- Supporting -----

[0.26190185546875] I would avoid the restaurant in the hotel as the service is slow and inconsistent.
[-0.002498626708984375] The location was good for us but it is definitely not the nicest area of town.
[-0.006256103515625] Will stay at the real Hilton the next time!

[0.9781908988952637] The location is great.
Parent: The location is great , the hotel itself is fairly new so everything was clean and nicely presented .

[0.9781908988952637] Location was fantastic.
[0.9569253921508789] GOOD: Location is awesome!!!
[0.942133903503418] Excellent location!
[0.9404354095458984] Fantastic location (OK they are renewing the old fashion district in the downtown core) but this hotel is quite wonderful !
[0.9381647109985352] The location was wonderful, a stones throw from King Street which is the entertainment district area.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.631561279296875] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[-0.2566871643066406] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[-0.2207183837890625] We were on the 9th floor facing West and the view was so-so, but to be honest I wasn't there for the view anyway.
[-0.0888671875] Not near a subway, but no need, we walked everywhere.
[-0.08494186401367188] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!

[0.6695289611816406] The hotel is new.
Parent: The location is great , the hotel itself is fairly new so everything was clean and nicely presented .

[0.6695289611816406] I slept in many hotels downtown Toronto, and I can say this new Hilton hotel is the best one.
[0.27825927734375] Fantastic location (OK they are renewing the old fashion district in the downtown core) but this hotel is quite wonderful !
[0.1373443603515625] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.
[0.10650634765625] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.
[0.014888763427734375] Loved the area around this hotel, we had stayed around the Dundas area the previous week and this was much better.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.710601806640625] yet the restaurant had the same high quality as the big box Hilton.
[-0.3865814208984375] Shopping district for shoppers out there.
[-0.30951690673828125] It is convenient to a nearby Shopper's Drug Mart (to pick up some in room snacks) and a large LCBO with a rather big Vintages section for some excellent wine for the room.
[-0.2597808837890625] It is not that hard to match up numbers on tickets to find a vehicle.
[-0.15712356567382812] Lot's of bars and restaurants nearby and plenty of local mini-markets for day to day necessities.

[-0.8491039276123047] The first night was during the huge Caribe fest and it was crazy outside!
[-0.8441238403320312] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[-0.7198448181152344] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.
[-0.62188720703125] Nothing to complain about (but for the freezing cold in the main hall...)
[-0.3822479248046875] Shopping district for shoppers out there.

[0.4240093231201172] The rooms are equal to anything Hilton offers, the fitness facility is first rate and the restaurant staff are friendly and attentive - to the right degree.
[0.37946319580078125] Great rates, Great location, friendly staff.
[0.22890090942382812] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
[0.16823959350585938] Restaurant was really good too with great service!

[-0.9850726127624512] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.

[-0.0016279220581054688] You need a room card to get into the building after 11 pm.
Parent: Second , after 11 pm you have to use your room card to get into the building .

----- Supporting -----

[-0.0016279220581054688] The hotel is right beside a nightclub.
[-0.0022192001342773438] The hotel is in a good location, central and easy to walk from - the Art Gallery of Ontario is well worth a visit.
[-0.0025110244750976562] The Hotel location is excellent, near the CN Tower and many other attractions.
[-0.002727508544921875] Loved the area around this hotel, we had stayed around the Dundas area the previous week and this was much better.
[-0.0028076171875] We found the best street to walk - Queen Street & it's just a few short blocks from the hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.672393798828125] Then we asked the hotel (after we parked our car in the public parking) and they said that we'd pay $35 until 3 pm!!
[-0.656158447265625] It is not that hard to match up numbers on tickets to find a vehicle.
[-0.2904682159423828] I think the valet parking at the hotel is around the same amount and you can take your car in and out as needed.
[-0.2757740020751953] You can self-park but being right downtown I figured it wasn't worth the hassle to save a few bucks.
[-0.2645702362060547] Lot's of bars and restaurants nearby and plenty of local mini-markets for day to day necessities.
