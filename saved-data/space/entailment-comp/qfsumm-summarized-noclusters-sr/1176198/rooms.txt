[0.0591278076171875] Two nights we did have a guest, who had orginally intended to attend the conference: despite being assured on the phone that we could add a rollaway for him, when he arrived, we couldn't, and he and my colleague had to split a regular bed.

[0.2719268798828125] we were so tired and sore from bad sleep we went home early on monday without shopping or anything the room was kind of plain we had the room with a jacuzzi and fireplace but both nights when we were in bed sleeping the jacuzzi mysteriously turned on and woke us both up and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off.
[0.15924072265625] For some this may not be an issue, but also be aware, most rooms do not have bathtubs, just standup showers, so if you like to bath or have children who you need to bath, this is likely not the best choice.
[0.111083984375] It was an adjustable bed that allows you to choose the softness, I found it to be lumpy and uncomfortable.
