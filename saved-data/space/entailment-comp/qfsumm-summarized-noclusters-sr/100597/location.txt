[-0.00617218017578125] We were in Seattle.
Parent: The kids loved the pool which was warmer than the ones at the resort in Cancun which we could not believe as we were in Seattle !

----- Supporting -----

[-0.00617218017578125] I think parking cost $12 or so.
[-0.015283584594726562] I didn't rent a car, so didn't have the worries of paying a parking fee at the hotel.
[-0.01898956298828125] Valet parking was very quick and hassle free.
[-0.020053863525390625] We had planned to eat at the hotel restaurant but it was not open.
[-0.020656585693359375] When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9941139221191406] Very close to Seatac, we were tempted to walk there from the airport.
[-0.9917192459106445] This was right by the SeaTac Airport, whereby they had a shuttle that would come every 20 mins, and the valet would park the vehicle while we off traveling.
[-0.9899311065673828] My co-workers and I joke about the Doubletree Maze at SEATAC.
[-0.9874458312988281] This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking.
[-0.9814777374267578] Initially, I had a view of the airport.

[0.9470796585083008] The bed was comfortable.
Parent: It was great to have a comfortable bed and room on our final night of holidays .

----- Supporting -----

[0.9470796585083008] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
[0.35416221618652344] Hotel is very close the the airport and room was comfortable.
[0.0865020751953125] But it is fine for what it is- a quick, convenient, comfortable stay by the airport.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.868865966796875] The restaurant was quite good considering it's not "downtown".
[-0.8538093566894531] Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water.
[-0.8447647094726562] I arrived late at night and was flustered by the confusing and poorly lit parking options.
[-0.8280868530273438] It takes a few trips to figure it out.
[-0.7981414794921875] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!

[-0.5492782592773438] It wasn't loud at all from the airport but was loud from the hallway (which didn't bother us since we left by 5 am).

[0.70050048828125] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[0.498291015625] You are charged for parking - $8/night for outdoor parking.
[-0.002093076705932617] That's where I parked.
[-0.0029916763305664062] They were extremely convenient to the airport.

[-0.963958740234375] We get the stay and jet package so we park for a week for only $30.00.
[-0.950103759765625] Self-parking is $19.
[-0.949249267578125] What they didn't tell us when booking on the website is that the parking is $16 per night and the internet in the rooms is not wireless.
[-0.88262939453125] :) The only complaint is - parking for overnight cost $16, and on top of that, we had $1.40 of tax!!!

[-0.83209228515625] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[-0.19158935546875] We took the shuttle from the airport, and then back again to pick up our rental car (save the parking fee).
