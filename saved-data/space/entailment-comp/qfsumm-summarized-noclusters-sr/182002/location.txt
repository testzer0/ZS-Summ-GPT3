[0.9738297462463379] The location is great.
[0.9737763404846191] The location was good, right where I needed to be, and the price was great for downtown and I only paid $89 with a corporate discount.
[0.9650945663452148] The location is good and it was close to a great Thai food restaurant which I would recommend if you like Thai.
[0.949254035949707] We were pleased with the choice, and the location was perfect.
[0.9411802291870117] The location is good being a short walk into town and is close to the new Loblaws food emporium at Maple Leaf Gardens.

[0.5941810607910156] The hotel parking is too expensive.
Parent: The hotel parking was a little expensive ( CAN $ 15 ) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV .

----- Supporting -----

[0.5941810607910156] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.037021636962890625] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[0.0218048095703125] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
[0.0168609619140625] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.0078887939453125] The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot!

[-0.9535613059997559] It was close to the theatre we were going to and the price was affordable.
[-0.8192129135131836] Would stay there again as price was great and location perfect.
[-0.7917361259460449] From the map it looked like it was pretty much in the middle of the downtown area and the rate was cheaper than some of the other hotels.
[-0.7854681015014648] The location was good, right where I needed to be, and the price was great for downtown and I only paid $89 with a corporate discount.

[-0.0012006759643554688] The hotel is in a great location and we were close to the CN Tower, the museum and the Hockey Hall of Fame.

[-0.9522247314453125] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.

[-0.314117431640625] They were also kind enough to recommend and make reservations at a lovely restaurant called Ruth Chris (pricey but well worth it if you are a steak lover).

[0.47515869140625] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.
[0.060577392578125] For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not.
[0.058258056640625] To get to the parking lot from the guest floors you will need to use an access card in the elevators; if you are not quick enough, or your card doesn't work properly, you will find that you are called to another floor.
[0.038665771484375] If you are staying here be warned about the parking though.

[-0.7901611328125] When at the restaurant, they gave me catchup that was so rancid it bubbled.
[-0.749237060546875] We mentioned on check in that it was our anniversary and were immediately upgraded from our room with 1 double to a king room on the highest floor with a wonderful view of the city.
[-0.74896240234375] The restaurant was also a great deal since our kids ate free from the buffet since they are younger.

[0.6344833374023438] The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car.
[0.435791015625] If you have a van or larger vehicle forget parking here.
[0.09616851806640625] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.
[0.01334381103515625] The window looking at a fantastic view north was so grimy it was hard to see through (finger and nose prints all over it) We just kept the net curtains closed so we couldn't see them and enjoyed the night lights instead.

[-0.59588623046875] I drive a smaller car so had no issues, but I think someone in a mini van might have trouble.
[-0.5446929931640625] The best thing about the room was its view.
[-0.284515380859375] Went on Bestwestern.com and booked the room online for $89.00 a night.
[-0.2793083190917969] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).
