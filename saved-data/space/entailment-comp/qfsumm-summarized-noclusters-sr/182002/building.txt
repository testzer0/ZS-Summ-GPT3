[0.053741455078125] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[0.02162933349609375] They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting.
[0.02127838134765625] You should also be aware that there are no fire sprinklers in the guest areas of the hotel.
[0.013919830322265625] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!
