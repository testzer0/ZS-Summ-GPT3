[0.0590667724609375] This is a decent hotel, but factor in the low prices, great location and little perks like free wi-fi, and I'd say that it's one of the best I've stayed in.
[0.017498016357421875] Other than the hotel is OK, but far from great.
[0.0144805908203125] the hotel is centrally located and is very comfortable with a nice bed and rooms cleaned daily.
