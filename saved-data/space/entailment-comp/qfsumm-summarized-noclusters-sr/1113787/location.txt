[0.53509521484375] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.

[0.27044677734375] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.

[-0.607147216796875] The staff at the hotel and the parking company (ACE parking) are working hard to rectify the situation, but at $27/night for parking one would hope that her car was more secure than it apparently was.
[-0.5731201171875] So, one word of caution; empty your car entirely when parking in their valet lot.
[-0.45465087890625] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[-0.370330810546875] In less than 30 seconds we were unloaded, vehicle whisked away for parking.
[-0.3473320007324219] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.
