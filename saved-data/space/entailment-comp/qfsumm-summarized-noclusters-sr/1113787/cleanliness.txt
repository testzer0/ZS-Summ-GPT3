[-0.01847553253173828] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.0529022216796875] We brought this to the attention of the valet manager who said "we were very busy last night and had 8 or 9 guys parking cars.
[-0.05986595153808594] We saw another guest who was checking out looking at the back of his vehicle as well!
