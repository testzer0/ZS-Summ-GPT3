[-0.0059757232666015625] I was attending a conference at the hotel next door and my peers shared with me that they were paying more per night than I was.
[-0.006221771240234375] And don't pay more than $129/night for a room, there are better deals out there in the higher price range.
[-0.0100860595703125] I didn't try it, but it doesn't look appetizing.
[-0.013446807861328125] A decent price for a room in downtown Seattle in the summer.

[-0.20044898986816406] The only food available is from a Chinese restaurant that is in the hotel.
[-0.09429550170898438] The choice of channels for the tv is terrible....for the amount you pay this place you should get more than 20 channels....the only thing great about this place is the water pressure.
[-0.082550048828125] I far rather prefer the individual bottles.

Parent: Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review ; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge .
