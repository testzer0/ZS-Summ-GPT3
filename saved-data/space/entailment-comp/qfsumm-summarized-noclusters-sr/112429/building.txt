[-0.0011157989501953125] After staying for a week in late September, I decided to write a review.
Parent: Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review ; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge .

[-0.0011157989501953125] The hotel was well designed and tastefully decorated.
[-0.0021953582763671875] Portland is a great city to visit, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
[-0.002513885498046875] Other than the thin wall between rooms, it was an excellent stay and we'd definitely stay there again.
[-0.002819061279296875] The lobby is small, but nice.
[-0.0029354095458984375] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.

[-0.24938201904296875] They could not find our car for about an hour!
[-0.240447998046875] We nearly thought our car was stolen!
[-0.17713356018066406] I talked to the front desk and they painlessly arranged for a hotel town car to take me in so I could make my flight on time.
[-0.07647705078125] Still not sure why our car could not be found for that time.
[-0.05146026611328125] That was my only real complaint, that weird gappy window/air thing.

[0.0013904571533203125] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.
[-0.0014801025390625] The man who was working at the front desk looked very gruff and mean, when I would ask something he made me feel like I was putting him out.

[-0.0030040740966796875] There is BTW always only one person at front desk, so you can find yourself lining up to get even the simplest things done, like getting a demagnetized card reprogrammed.
[-0.007350921630859375] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
