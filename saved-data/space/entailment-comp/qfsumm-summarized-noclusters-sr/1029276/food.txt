[0.5993194580078125] The hotel is okay.
Parent: Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler .

[0.5993194580078125] We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.
[0.444000244140625] Again conference food just ok though, damn those $16 DOJ muffins Rooms a are good, big tvs, comfy beds, nice setup.
[0.4425048828125] Breakfast was cold, room service was OK. As I'm writing this review, we've been without water - the entire hotel - for more than 3 hours.
[0.14666748046875] Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.
[0.1318359375] The drinks and food are pricey in the hotel, but then again in Miami everything seems to be expensive.

[-0.471832275390625] For such an international city I thought there would be more attention paid to international wines, but that's my thing so...
