[0.18560791015625] Hilton Miami Downtown is okay.
Parent: Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler .

----- Supporting -----

[0.18560791015625] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.
[0.129638671875] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
[0.107421875] The Downtown Miami Hilton is on the fringe of the downtown area but very close to the light rail and a short drive to S. Beach and Little Havana.
[0.10711669921875] The hotel is a three minute walk to the Metromover which will take you to Bayside in a couple of minutes where there is nightlife, shops, drinks, and restaurants.
[0.100738525390625] Location is walkable to the Arsht Center, American Airlines Arena, and Bayside, but you would need a taxi/car for anything else.

[-0.7402076721191406] Would never stay here again and maybe not at another Hilton either.
[-0.7050857543945312] I'd suggest Hilton put a few dollars into a rehab.
[-0.612335205078125] Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.
[-0.5845489501953125] I did not like the area the hotel was in i would of prefered south beach area.
[-0.54425048828125] The view was amazing.

[-0.9846372604370117] When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore.
