[0.06279754638671875] I enjoyed staying here but I don't understand why there isn't free internet like in all other hotels I stayed in during my 3-week vacation.
[0.03985595703125] I stayed here one night on business, enjoying the $89/night rate they were advertising on their web site.
[0.033203125] The front desk guy was nice enough to give us a room facing the bay after we requested it although what they had available was on the 4th floor.
[0.03165435791015625] Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards.

[-0.8603019714355469] Downtown did not feel safe at all, and there were alot of unsavoury looks as we did walk 4 blocks from the Hotel.
[-0.8123588562011719] The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in.
[-0.7804832458496094] Regardless of what you are told it is not safe for anyone.
[-0.7451210021972656] Phone - don't go near it.
[-0.7431831359863281] I will be not be staying at this hotel again and if you want a good nights sleep at a hotel with a friendly staff I recommend you don't either.

[0.02587890625] FRONT DESK: Members of the front desk staff were extremely rude and condescending!!
[0.022430419921875] They also had a business center with free internet access for guests, so we were able to check our flight info, which was a big help.

[-0.9107933044433594] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.

[-0.9433450698852539] Thanks to Anthony at the front desk who managed to get us a room with a great view for my partners birthday.
[-0.745819091796875] For example, I was told by the front desk that I needed to go down to the transportation office in order to book the shuttle to the cruise terminal.
[-0.6490249633789062] As the hours wore on, I became increasingly agitated with United Airlines which could not confirm with certainty the location of my bag or when it would be delivered.
[-0.579376220703125] It could have been there 10 minutes or 10 hours, who knows--a bellman had accepted delivery and never reported it to anyone.
[-0.40191650390625] I called the front desk, they responded, but little control over the situation.

[-0.685333251953125] If you're visiting the med school, it's supposedly only 2.5 miles away - but it took me nearly half an hour to deal with the miami traffic - so either familiarize yourself the night before OR leave early enough to address the bumper to bumper traffic.
