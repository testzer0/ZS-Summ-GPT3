[0.7498550415039062] Hilton Miami Downtown is an okay hotel.
Parent: Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler .

----- Supporting -----

[0.7498550415039062] We stayed at the Hilton Miami Downtown hotel for 2 nights before joining a cruise and were very happy with the hotel.
[0.59100341796875] My husband and friends stayed at the Hilton Miami Downtown for a week.We really enjoy this hotel.Our room was clean and comfortable.The pool is great if you enjoy swimming great drinks at the pool bar.Driveway staff was very friendley and polite.
[0.45660400390625] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace
[0.3838043212890625] This hotel is best suited for the folks who want a decent place to stay when working in downtown Miami or are going to catch a cruise.
[0.2889862060546875] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.

[-0.9166049957275391] this is the worst joint ever.
[-0.8311195373535156] Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business.
[-0.8055438995361328] My opinion is that this motel was extremely unorganized during this time.
[-0.7114334106445312] Cons: hotel loud, construction going on outside, Internet is not free.
[-0.64617919921875] Long story short itâ€™s a good thing I spent more time out of the hotel than in because my stay at the Downtown Miami Hilton could have ruined my entire vacation.

[0.04958343505859375] It did seem that it was full of business people and a couple of seminars taking place but this meant the bar was lively on the evening and the pool area was very quiet during the day so we could soak up the sun with just a couple of other people around :) Overall I would definately recommend this hotel and also stay again if we return to Miami
