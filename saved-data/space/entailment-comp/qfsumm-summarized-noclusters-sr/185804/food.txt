[0.1141510009765625] Vancouver is a quick visit.
Parent: We enjoyed a quick , one - night visit to Vancouver , and stayed at the Granville Island Hotel .

[0.1141510009765625] If you want to visit downtown just take the water taxi or "aqua bus" these little boats are fun, not very expensive and the quickest way to gt there.
[0.015167236328125] The two water taxis companies serving Granville Island make it very accessible to downtown as well.
[-0.00095367431640625] The food is excellent and the view is amazing.
[-0.00330352783203125] Also, there is a brewery on site, and some of the beers were great.
[-0.004119873046875] Every day we would get up and walk the short walk to the "Public Market" and have our breakfast or lunch.

[-0.29460906982421875] Needed to stay in Vancouver for 3 nights for a health review at UBC.
[-0.213104248046875] For old times sake, we even had lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory, but the food wasn't very good, so we decided to give the city a miss and pootle around the Island instead .
[-0.19916534423828125] I expect more considering the price.
[-0.19374847412109375] They asked me if I wouldn’t mind waiting as they offered to make it from scratch… highly worth the wait.

Parent: We enjoyed a quick , one - night visit to Vancouver , and stayed at the Granville Island Hotel .

[0.043792724609375] I probably wouldn't eat there though if I was paying for it myself as the menu was pretty expensive and there are several great places to eat elsewhere on the Island.

[0.195404052734375] Our evening snack on the patio was delicious, relaxing and we had a lovely server...again most helpful and obliging...and the view!
[0.14105224609375] quiet at night without the often ugly street level scene you encounter at more glamorous high-rises (yes the high-rises can give you great views but coming out at street level you feel like you've walked into a seedy bus station environment).

Parent: The public spaces are nicely decorated , but our room had a couple of sad " department store " prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity , I would have loved to see better art ( why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street , and promote local artists ? )
