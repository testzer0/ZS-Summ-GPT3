[0.35369873046875] The hotel restaraunt was ok, not outstanding but pretty good.
[0.08453369140625] The restuarant in the hotel is quite nice and despite its "brewery" designation is much more of a full menu than you might expect.

[-0.00054931640625] The location, although not downtown, was still great.
[-0.00110626220703125] We had shared a home for over 6 years at this point, so the loyalty to family surprised me a bit but I got over it at this lovely get-away.
[-0.001983642578125] The location was perfect.
[-0.002841949462890625] on location - it is not downtown but across the water.

[-0.9963946342468262] This hotel is located close enough to downtown to walk to in 1/2 hour( using the aquabus to cross the channel) but also very close to local interesting sites on granville island and is a 15 min walk to Broadway St and 4th Ave where there are numerous placed to eat.

[0.446746826171875] Thanks again for a great Vacouver visit!
[0.4251708984375] The location is the biggest draw for us, Granville Island by day is full of energy, a great place to pick up something tasty at the Public Market, find a seat, listen to the buskers and people watch.
[0.2957935333251953] Nice way to see the park and bit more of Vancouver.
[0.29290771484375] The island itself is lovely to wander around, and each day we bought either breakfast or a picnic lunch at the market.

Parent: We enjoyed a quick , one - night visit to Vancouver , and stayed at the Granville Island Hotel .

----- Supporting -----

[0.9922165870666504] We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel because it was close to the Stanley Theatre and a $12 cab fare to downtown.
[0.9007377624511719] One of the drawbacks of staying on Granville Island is the parking - almost impossible at the weekend, even after paying the hotel $7 for a pass that allows you to park beyond the normal 3 hour limit.

[-0.1304607391357422] and it was unclear as to whether we should evacuate.
[-0.11182403564453125] Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes.
[-0.102508544921875] Later that night, we went back to the Dockside restaurant for dinner.

[0.0447540283203125] The public spaces are decorated nicely.
Parent: The public spaces are nicely decorated , but our room had a couple of sad " department store " prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity , I would have loved to see better art ( why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street , and promote local artists ? )

----- Supporting -----

[0.0447540283203125] Even though we had requested the basic "non-view" category, our little balcony had a view of the water across to downtown, and a bonus was the fireworks over Science World (after all, it was Halloween).
