[0.7044754028320312] The public spaces are decorated.
Parent: The public spaces are nicely decorated , but our room had a couple of sad " department store " prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity , I would have loved to see better art ( why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street , and promote local artists ? )

[0.03104400634765625] To get there, we took the quick little ferry from downtown, and walked with our rolling suitcases to the hotel, conveniently located and yet away from any traffic.
[0.009185791015625] We arrived after a 9 hour flight from London on our honeymoon and thanks to our bestman the hotel knew about this and upgraded us.Then later in the evening the booking for the penthouse was cancelled, and guy at the desk asked if we would like to move.
