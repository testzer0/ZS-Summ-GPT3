[0.26385498046875] The hotel is calm.
Parent: It 's a calm , well - designed " boutique " hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island .

[0.26385498046875] The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.
[-0.047088623046875] The computer and printer located in the lobby for guests to use was very helpful.
[-0.05123138427734375] We arrived a little late on Xmas day after a troublesome time with the car rental company (Budget did not have a car for me despite having a valid reservation).
[-0.0703125] The hotel's lobby was undergoing renovations at the time but it never created any issues with our stay.

[-0.9861087799072266] The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.
[-0.9718074798583984] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
[-0.9384536743164062] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[-0.8863296508789062] We went to the Pacific Culinary Institute and that was amazing!
[-0.757415771484375] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
