***** Golden Review 1 *****
The breakfast was generally very good , although it was the same every day, and sometimes reported as cold. Complimentary coffee, fruit, and bottled water were offered once one exists the elevator in the morning into the lobby. The restaurant on the main level was excellent, had a variety of food and drinks. The breakfast buffet was expensive.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The noninclusive continental breakfast buffet is expensive at $20, but it's worth it. Complimentary coffee, fruit, and bottled water are also available once one exits the elevator in the morning into the lobby.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
Complimentary coffee, fruit, and bottled water were offered at the Hilton Miami Downtown. The breakfast buffet wasn't complimentary but it was well worth the $20.00.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
Though I found the hotel very pricey (for us) I'm sure you could get a much better rate on line.
Since we paid $210 for the night I thought we'd get free parking - we used the valet service for $28 (plus tips) which we found pricey also.
We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.
The food at the restaurant was excellent and the service was great.
There is no food or entertainment around.
Also, the food was far above the standard conference selection.
My girlfriend and I got it for a great price.
Coffee was amazing.
We were able to grab some bottles of water and fruit on our way out for the day.

Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.
Just need to watch out for all the greedy homeless people outside.
It tool almost 30 min to make some food an no one else was there other than the homeless people that kept asking to get their cup refilled for them.
The food is decent, nothing great, but Bayside is just a short drive or 20 min.
walk in one direction and there are more places to eat in the other direction.
We wanted to get dessert to take to our room.
for the price, it's OK, nothing more.
On both nghts we have waited for 20 minutes or more for our drinks.
The first night our food orders took forever and tonight I never got my slice of pie and our second round of drinks never arrived.
There was one occasion in which we ordered from the menu, sadly it was a little disappointing because it was overcooked but we were taken care of almost immediately when we complained.
We had a snack in the lounge as that's all that was available.
It was almost uneatable, but we were hungry.
Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
Breakfast was cold, room service was OK. As I'm writing this review, we've been without water - the entire hotel - for more than 3 hours.
There are just a few fast-food eateries near the entrance of the hotel.
The banquet food was fabulous and themed menus were creative and well presented.
I loved the shrimp and crab claws.
I had a great burger and beer at the lobby bar upon arrival and felt like the staff was very friendly in all departments.

The hotel is very clean, the staff professional - and the food - simply amazing.
What I got was beyond what I expected - I was stuffed to the brim.
Just used the lounge for snack in the early evening and breakfast the next morning.
We had lunch one day and breakfast another
There was a problem with heating system, but it seems it was the first time ever they need it...
Heating quite noisy.
A little bit pricy but you are staying at Hilton, so you expected to pay a bit more.
In addition, it did not enough tea bags for two people.
Kendall Jackson and BV were about it.
For such an international city I thought there would be more attention paid to international wines, but that's my thing so...
The drinks and food are pricey in the hotel, but then again in Miami everything seems to be expensive.

There are fast food places to eat right across the street, you would have to drive a few blocks for a good place to eat.
I could have spent less in the end and stayed somewhere else.
I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
I also enjoyed the Lounge and food there.
Food during the meeting was very good.
Lounge lacked bottles of water!
Other food in the lounge was good (fruit, coffee).
When we arrived, only option for a meal was at the bar in the lobby.
Horrible club sandwich!
Cold fat soaked bacon, processed meats, and very expensive.
Recommendation: eat elsewhere; even room service would probably have been better.
Once coffee machine was used it was not replenished, even after a request to staff.
Food: seriously excellent snapper, bomb key lime pie.
Again conference food just ok though, damn those $16 DOJ muffins Rooms a are good, big tvs, comfy beds, nice setup.
Too many hobos and drug addicts!!!
Also a salad place and sandwich shop just past 19th St (hotel is on 16th).
$28 in this economy??
Had a great internet deal we found on hilton.com for the website, so we were able to stay there for under $65 a night.
The manager called and said the water was safe and we explained we did not feel comfortable bathing and brushing our teeth in green water.
