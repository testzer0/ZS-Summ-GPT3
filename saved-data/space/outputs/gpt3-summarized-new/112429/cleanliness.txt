Aspect: cleanliness
***** Model produced summary in the 1st round *****
Part 1 of 4: The room was not clean when the reviewer arrived, and housekeeping did not come by until later in the day. There were also some concerns about the sanitation of the shampoo and conditioner dispensers in the shower.
Part 2 of 4: Some reviews said the hotel was clean, some said it was not. Some said the maids left the alarm on from the last guest, and some said there was a lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms. One reviewer said the housekeeper walked in on them without knocking. Another reviewer said there was a stain on the mattress that was not cleaned.
Part 3 of 4: The Paramount was a clean and positive experience. There were a few drawbacks, however, including the fitness center which was in the basement and felt like a dungeon. Additionally, the hotel charges for WiFi, which is something that many other hotels do not do.

***** Sentences in Cluster ****
Staid here during Sakura-Con with a group of teens.
My room was warm and I discovered the fan was on, but the A/C was not.
The thermostat was worn so you could not tell which setting was A/C and which was heat.
They use energy saving compact flourescent bulbs so the room was not very bright for reading.
Great pricing compared to other hotels near by.
Not to mention when I checked in they yelled my room number out to me, not a good idea as a female travelling alone...
Pretty basic information for a concierge to screw up on!
When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.
I called down to the front desk to find out what time housekeeping would be coming by as I wanted to have a nap before I went to the game.
Has fitness (I did not use it), free Wi-Fi and a desk where you can print e.g.
Don't know the concierges name, it would be the older man in the morning but he had great recommendations for restaurants, each one excellent and was so knowledgeable about the city and when was the best times to go to events.
The best thing is they have an empty fridge so you can put all your goodies that you buy from pike place inside
There is no complimentary anything.
I don't like the shampoo and conditioner dispenser attached to the wall in the shower though.
They just seem unsanitary to me.
The A/C, no matter how low it was set, didn't keep the room very cool.
Only one block walk to the Nordstrom flagship store, three blocks to Macy's and about six to Pike Place Market.
The valet man was excellent.
It was just a short walk to the mall where we got to ride the monorail to the Seattle center.
The concierge was more than polite as he parked our car which was included in our package.
The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.
The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
It was rush hour, so the concierge had to stand out there quite a while to catch one that was empty.
The decor was cool and modern.
I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.
A waiter showed up and took coffee orders.
My companion and I stayed at this hotel because it was one of the most affordable on the day we went.
We were also provided with free Wifi, which was great!
There is a coffee maker and an empty refrigerator.
They do have free weights and a bench though so I used those instead.
- The housekeeper walked in on me without knocking at 9 a.m. in the morning when I was getting ready to go in the shower.
It was put away in the glove box and we noticed immediately that it was gone when the Valet brought our car to us.
Pikes Market was 4 blocks away.
We asked for more towels and they arrived within minutes.
I notified the front desk to make sure it was cleaned at some point.
My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
Never ever seen this in any hotel I have ever stayed at.
Hotel concierge, Tom, provided us with valuable information on how to save lots of money by taking light rail from the airport to the hotel, only 2 blocks from light rail station.
Free wi-fi.
I ended up with a very early morning arrival flight, and hoped that the hotel would hold my bags until check in since I had a meeting at 11am... they let me check into my room at 9:30am!
The night before I needed to leave there was a big snowstorm in town, and I was worried the rail system would not be running the next morning.
The decor fits well with the holidays.
The sushi was good and the drink selection interesting and yummy .
Getting my car from the valet took less than three minutes... My stay at the Paramount was a very pleasant and positive experience.
Now, a few drawbacks - the hotel charges $9.95/day for wifi, does any other motel/hotel anywhere do that anymore?
I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.
The only thing I didn't care for was the fitness center, which was sort of a dungeon in the basement.
ps: the chocolate truffles that was promoted through a Foursquare check-in was extremely good.
Not counting the missing kettle!
The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the decor in good taste (lots of texture, neutral tone, and rich burgandy to soothe the spirit).
The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
The bellman made up for it, who gave us the idea of taking Light Rail to the airport, saving us about $35!
Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.
We then called down to have our car retrieved from the valet upon checking out.
The only aspect of the hotel that could be improved, in my opinion, is the fitness center -- it's in the basement and has older equipment.
It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.
It's Asian inspired and they have some incredible little dishes of sushi and japanese type dishes.
Monorail super close.
Wi-fi, however, was spotty in strength, and I frequently had difficulty maintaining a connection.
The Dragonfish Sushi is right in the hotel downstairs.
I had Sake for $1.
Lolita was great as well.
