Aspect: rooms
***** Model produced summary *****
The rooms at Hilton Miami Downtown are spacious but dated. Housekeeping is attentive, but there can be a lot of people in the room at one time.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The rooms had excellent creature comforts, towels pillows and bedding . I felt that it was a very comfortable, nicely decorated, spacious sleeping room. The rooms overlooking the bay were fantastic with floor to ceiling windows with amazing views. The bathroom is also really nice, as well.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The rooms were large and had floor to ceiling windows great views of the bay and Miami skyline. The rooms came with a pullout sofa, flat screen TV, and a refrigerator. The bed was comfortable, with fresh linens. In the bathrooms there were clean towels.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The room was very large and nicely decorated. The great amenities included a flat panel TV, fridge, and two outer walls/windows with amazing views of Miami. The bathroom was also nice, with fresh-smelling towels. The bed was extremely comfortable and big, excellent for a good night's sleep.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
Rate are cheap, but breakfast was not included and hotel charges $20 for breakfast buffet.
Rooms are spacious, but dated.
Pool was dirty.
This hotel was booked for us through our travel agent - it was near the airport & near the port of Miami where we were leaving on a cruise.
The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet!
Despite some negative comments that we read on this site we still decided to give the Hilton a chance because the location was perfect for our trip.
The room was nice.
We had a Jr. Suite with the Bay view.
The room was very spacious and nicely put together.
We made a complainant and were told we could have a free breakfast.
When we went to retrieve the breakfast we were told that we couldnâ€™t get it and were accused of lying about getting a free breakfast.
Long story short itâ€™s a good thing I spent more time out of the hotel than in because my stay at the Downtown Miami Hilton could have ruined my entire vacation.
Don't really need this on holiday especially when you have been out really early say on an excursion and you return late afternoon/early evening to find room not cleaned or replenished.
Pool area although at roof level and could be quite a haven staff appeared once again overwhelmed at busy times - could not keep on top of towel demand and allowed guests to bring bottles/glasses into the pool area.
One issue with the executive lounge access - hotel literature stated the lounge should have been open from 6.00 am - this was not the case and when we arrived on one occasion to grab breakfast before leaving for the day we were told to "try later lounge not opening yet staff had not arrived".
A group of three of us stayed at this motel during October 9th thru October 13th.
My opinion is that this motel was extremely unorganized during this time.
Upon arrival at the motel my party was told that we couldn't be checked into a room despite paying our trip in advance because they were having issues receiving payment from the vendor.
Upon checking in the room they assigned us was the wrong type.
We had to go back downstairs to be assigned another room.
The room we finally received was very nice.
We stayed in 724 which was a one bedroom suite.
It was very spacious and well kept.
They provided me a room with a great view, and my room was very clean and equipped appropriately.
Other than the noise and kids, it was a good hotel.
This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace
Spring fling rate of $125 which included a food credit for $50, champagne and late check-out.
Our room was nicely decorated, great linens, flat screen tv and a beautiful view of Miami skyline.
This is my second night here at Hilton hotel downtown miami.
We still have two more nights to enjoy here!!!
We feel so VIP;-)
We were upgraded to a much nicer room with a terrific view of the water and access to the concierge room.
Cold water bottles in their mini fridge, fruit, complimentary breakfast in the morning!
Selected this hotel for a group/work event.
The meeting rooms and lodging rooms were very nice.
My wife and I stayed here as a 1 night pre-cruise hotel.
I had bid on this thorugh one of those "find out the name after you commit" websites.
We got the room, taxes and breakfast for $90.
The room was great especially the bedding.
Next time I go to Maimi I will stay at the Hilton.
The hotel is a very short walk from the Metromover whcih we took to Bayside Marketplace.
This is a stay overnight for a cruise hotel.
The hotel was full and jumping with lively but good natured Colts fans and had a fantastic atmosphere.
In spite of everything, the hotel coped very well and it was great - food, staff, room, lounge all excellent.
This hotel was great.
The room was very nice, as was the bathroom.
The room was quite large.
Room service was great - they had great 24 hour food - try the conch chowder, the conch fritters, key lime pie - I could keep going, everything was delicious.
The outdoor pool and patio were awesome and not even that busy.
After 6 nights at South Beach right beside Ocean Drive, this hotel and downtown Miami (particularly Bayside) were a great escape for us.
This hotel was just great, exactly what you would expect from a Hilton.
This hotel was awesome.
The hotel, its rooms and amenities were all very nice.
If you are not leaving the hotel early, you pay $1.50 per hour between 7am and 10pm.
pros: Room was clean though a little tight and the city view was great at night.
Nice, clean hotel with great view.
The hotel itself was great.
Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards.
I had prepaid for a junior suite and requested a higher floor room with a nice bayview and early check-in if possible.
When we got to the hotel, around 11a.m, room wasn't ready, but they checked our bags and we went straight to the pool.
I was told they would put a rush on getting the room ready and they asked for my cell phone.
By 12:30 p.m, I got a call on my cell phone to inform me our room was ready.
Beautiful room, gorgeous view.
The only thing I found strange was that there was no mini fridge in the room, even for a suite our size.
The room had two huge windows with a nice view and it was nice and cleanly decorated.
The buffet breakfast (whcich was part of the room rate) was very good I must say, although it was the same every day, but we didn't mind).
Of course the downside was that the elevators were slow, depending on what time of the day it was ..but the way people complain on here, you would think it was the end of the world.
However the Hotel has an old feel to it and the surrounding areas outside the hotel was a bit rundown and had a grimy feel.
The rooms are ok. Clean, quiet at night and good beds.
Our room had a balcony that we couldn't use because of all the construction going on.
Tools and debris were lying on the balcony.
A few weeks ago I visited this beautiful hotel and I stayed only one night because I was taking a cruise.
Nice room with a nice bay view.
i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, found the hotel clean and friendly, good bar area and resturant...
Overall i found this hotel to be one of the nicest hotels that i have stayed in, we flew to miami from vegas and arrived at 7.30am we were able to check in which was great staff were very helpfull.
When I returned to the hotel after my cruise, I learned that I had been upgraded to a suite--yay!
This hotel deals with lots of "cruisers" and the location is so convenient next to the port --I could see my ship from my hotel window.
Good amenities without a lot of nickel-and-diming, eg, free high-speed Internet with 5 or 6 terminals and connected printers.
This was a great hotel.
The rooms are really nice and clean and the staff is amazing.
this is the worst joint ever.
Sorry diverted from the hotel but it was perfect!
Great rate for a room to accomodate 4 persons.
Large room.
Very comfortable beds.
Noise never a problem, just navigating the in and out of hotel slight challenge.
This is an older hotel but seems to have been renovated fairly recently.
One annoyance, the first suite assigned to me was already occupied!
Second room was upgrade to huge corner junior suite with nice view thru floor-ceiling windows of Biscayne Bay and cruise ship harbor.
Hotel was packed with south american tourists but my corner room was quiet.
Room was in good condition and seemed fairly recent renovation.
The hotel seemed renovated and it was clean and beautiful.
We had a room on the 14th floor overlooking downtown Miami.
The room itself was huge compared to other hotels I've stayed at.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel close to the Miami port and I would definitely stay here again.
Reserved a king sized bed through lastminutetravel, however was not available when we arrived.
I would always ask for an upgrade if you dont already that that room.
I travel to Miami on a regular basis and always stay here when the rates are competitive.
The pool area is nice and the water is just two blocks away.
Our room could have been better, candy wrappers in the dresser drawers and a pair on men's underwear crumpled up by the picture window.
First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
So the hotel - fine, for the cost, if you have to be downtown, it's an OK choice.
This was my first and last time at the Hilton downtown Miami.
Checking was fine and the room view was outstanding...that's the good.
The room,...bathroom had hair on the sink and tub.
I was 5 rooms away from the elevator and the noise in the hall of just the elevator was annoying.
Then after registration you need to walk to a different set of elevators across the hotel to get to your room.
This is a very nice hotel, especially for the price.
I was pleasantly surprised.
Extremely comfortable beds.
Two fast food restaurants across the street.
Gorgeous pool.
I was on the 8th floor.
The rooms are clean and truly comfortable.
Overall, great place, great hotel, great staff.
The total package!!
overall, we are very happy with this hotel.
We have a great room, spectacular view.
However, we have sought a bit of relaxation in the lounge both nights we have been here.
We gave up, paid for the drinks we had and retreated to our comfortable room.
If low ceilings bother you this is not the place for you.
This hotel is best suited for the folks who want a decent place to stay when working in downtown Miami or are going to catch a cruise.
We only picked it because we wanted a hotel that would give us the night we needed for our Hilton Honors points.
That having been said that have updated the rooms and the corner Jr. Suite is very spacious, had a great view of the bay but lacked a microwave or a mini-refrigerator???
The bathroom was small as well.
The pool area was actually a nice surprise as it was spacious and well furnished with a very friendly full service pool bar and grill.
This is a very large hotel and very busy with many international guest (we overheard many languages spoken) and eventhough the staff was VERY busy they all had a great attitude and friendly demeanor.
Our room was very comfortable and had a amazing view of the city and of the bay.
The breakfast buffet was quiet nice.
Fantastic hotel, keep it up!
The hotel is old and needs some updating in several areas.
The Hilton Honors lounge had a very nice breakfast available but it seemed that the superivisor was the only one who took the initiative to clean tables, so was hard to find a clean one.
My husband and friends stayed at the Hilton Miami Downtown for a week.We really enjoy this hotel.Our room was clean and comfortable.The pool is great if you enjoy swimming great drinks at the pool bar.Driveway staff was very friendley and polite.
My husband and I stayed at the Miami Hilton for a conference he was attending.
First, the toilet paper holder is 2.5 ft. away from the toilet - I kid you not.
You almost fall off of the toilet trying to get it.
I'm sleeping in the bed with my husband.
Third, the entire hotel is a little run down.
We did a roundtrip in Florida and stayed here for two nights.
There is no fridge or in-room safe in the room.
The bathroom is also really nice, here the towels smells like they should.
Also we tried the breakfast buffet, it was tastfull and complete (20 dollar p.p.)
One of the best hotels during our holiday, if there is a next time, we book it again without any doubt .
Beds were very comfortble with excellent creature comforts, towels pillows and bedding and I felt that it was a very comfortable sleeping room.
Nice pool area for catching some sun or for a late night swim..
I visted this hotel on a Thursday with two other family members.
The lobby, restautant, bar and pool looked great at this hotel.
The rooms and hallways left a little more to be desired.
On the way to my room someone had dropped 3 beers on the floor and it was wet and sticky with the cans still there and a wet floor sign in the middle.
The room's didnt look nearly as good as they did in other less known cities.
No safe or frig in the rooms.
They only give 2 free continental breakfast coupons no matter how many people you book in the room.
I didnt like the looks of the free continental breakfast so I ordered room service and it was tasty and arrived quickly.
The room was really clean, the hotel facilities were very good and the views from the room were amazing, we could not fault the service and the breakfast, everything was presented well.

The room was wonderful and they actually had one unexpectedly ready for us to check-in at 9:30 a.m., well before their 3 p.m. check-in time.
Stayed 1 night at this Hotel (prior to cruise embarkation the next day).
The room was large, clean and quiet.
Bed was comfortable.
Great view of the port from my room.
Most guests are in T-shirt, shorts and slippers (We are in Miami!)
I stayed here when I went to visit U of M. I got a great deal online!
The room was immaculate (although the hair dryer had a broken attachment).
I was hhonors gold member so my room was upgraded to a bayview on high floor with access to lounge.
The room is a big corner room with a balcony as big as the room itself :P floor to ceiling window provide great view and bright natrual light.
There was one little bump in my stay, my room is a connecting room with the other side also occupied.
Minutes later, the manager is back at my door and told me they have resolved the issue with my next door neighbor and asked me if wanted to switch room.
It was late in the night so I thanked him and said I can just open the big sliding door to the balcony to air out the room.
We got an upgrade when checked in to a better view room, bay/city view which was gorgeous, specially at night!
The kids wanted to go the pool, so went there and had some really good sandwiches and the pool was clean and not so many people at all.
The executive lounge is in the 16th floor (also a great view!)
This hotel and the staff were great.
The rooms were GREAT!
Updated, clean, and very comfortable beds.
One of the rooms air conditioning did not work and the front desk gave a rebate for that room which was nice.
After working 15 years in the hotel business I know that perfection isnt always possible thus I appreciate it when hotel staff goes the extra mile.
Was pre-assigned room number 1630 a large corner room with its own huge private terrace.
The pool is on the roof just off of the lobby, with a large selection of loungers as well as couples loungers with cushions.
Would definitely recommend for a pre/post cruise stay.
We stayed at the Hilton for 2 nights after getting of a cruise.
The hotel itself was pretty good.
The room was spacious, but the walls very thin.
But the room was clean and bright.
Great Hotel perfect location, although there was a lot of construction around the hotel.
I had a corner room with views from two sides of the room.
We decided to stay at Hilton dowtown after a terrible experience in South Beach, at "Suites on South Beach".
We had a wonderful room at 20th floor with 2 walls of windows, overlooking the city.
Internet connection free in the lobby, pricy in the rooms, breakfast not included.
Nice swimming pool, even if not tried having 32Â°F.
The hotel formerly was a Radisson and the struistoric Hilton are better.
Anyway if you have a car it takes 3 minutes to go to South Beach and it is better spend money for a good hotel in downtown compared to a fake design hotel in SOBE.
At first they took us to an unready room which was disappointing but after a short wait they took us to a really big room with a great harbor scene as an apology to the mess.
The rooms are pretty new or renovated recently .
Bathroom is clean and wide.
The beds are comfortable and big.
The breakfast buffet wasn't included in the price but we enjoyed continental breakfast.
The rooms have fast internet access even internet tv but we didn't have time to use.
I am a frequent traveler to Miami and I have stayed at different hotels every time.
I stayed two nights in a room with two beds and floor to ceiling windows with a beautiful view of the city.
I plan to stay hotel in my future visits to Miami.
The breakfast buffet is expensive but worth it.
Complimentary coffee, fruit, and bottled water were offered once one exists the elevator in the morning into the lobby.
Room was clean, comfortable beds, with excellent view of the bay and downtown.
You may stayed at other modern hotels around the world and you will find it this hotel is a little bit dated.
However, I still think this hotel is very nice with the size of the room, lobby area, swimming pool and the gym.
We stayed for 2 nights before we board on the cruise ship.
Room is very clean overall.
Not only did the three of us feel unsafe but we were scared to stay in the room for fear the guard might have access to our room.
I liked the comfort of the beds, the flow of water in the shower, and the helpfulness of the staff, but that is pretty much it.
I liked the comfort of the beds, the flow of water in the shower, and the helpfulness of the staff, but that is pretty much it.
The hotel needs to seriously upgrade its rooms to be in par with other establishments.
The room was a bit dusty and the coffee station did not have stir sticks.
I would call this a four star hotel that's slightly rough around the edges.
My first room was a bit noisy as it was across the hall from the vending machine, so they moved me, gladly, to the 18th floor.
The pool was fine, relaxing for downtown location.
I had dinner outside in the nice Miami breeze.
I stayed here for a short break with a corporate rate which was able to jump to a bay view suite.
Rooms have a good area and all you need on a Hilton.
Rooms are very spacious and modern with large Windows and expansive views.
All in all a nice hotel.
Nice hotel no real complaints.
Nice bar and restaurant downstairs, great pool and views.
Stayed here for 2 nights in Sept 2008, on our way down to Key West.
Room was great, very large corner room, nice flat panel TV, fridge, the 2 outer walls were basically floor to ceiling windows with amazing views.
Hotel is clean and nicely decorated.
Now the things that ticked us off, and I know some of this isn't the fault of the hotel.
To further my aggravation, the hotel information stated that a continental breakfast buffet was included, however when we went down the dining area and got the kids some food and sat down to eat is when we were informed that the breakfast was not included, since we were already sitting and eating it was a little too late to get up and leave, add another $60 to the bill and my deal is now no deal.
only a few days ago, I was at the first time in miami also at the first time in this hotel and I'm impressed!
I only could recommend a stay in this wonderful hotel to everybody
Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business.
the hilton hotel downtown miami has the most amazing roof top pool and terrace.with stunning views over the port and miami.staff really helpful,and the rooms spacious clean and beds you just sink into.food and drink what you would expect to pay in city.pricey on overnight parking 28 dollars.but what a view of fireworks on new year.aesy to find and ideal if going on a cruise from miami port,only 5 mins drive.would recomend.
I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
The pool was outstanding and service very good there.
I will stay at this very busy hotel again.
Room was small and boring.
Pool sucked Cooling system was messed up (we could not control it) We stayed there 5 days and really got tired of it!
I stay at hundreds of hotels per year for work.
I have a difficult time sleeping at night so requested a room away from the elevator.
However, when I arrived my room as well as my mothers room who is also a very light sleeper is next to an elevator.
Guestroom was spacious and the bed was so nice, it was difficult to get up in the morning!
After finally being checked in I was given a room that had some problems.
Cons: hotel loud, construction going on outside, Internet is not free.
Pros: friendly staff, clean rooms
Booked a 2 queen bed junior suite for 5 people.
They were at most double beds.
The room was very large and had a pull-out sofa.
The room did have windows on 3 sides and a great view.
As a Hilton gold member, we went to the concierge level for the continental breakfast.
Extremely runny, undercooked scrambled eggs, bacon, cheap bagels, yogurt, some cereal.
I have had much better free continental breakfasts at Holiday Inns.
And if you think the reviews about the elevators are exaggerated, they are not.
We tried to take the stairs, but there is no direct route to the lobby and ended up on a wild goose chase around the building.
This was just an OK place to stay for 1 night.
This is the 3rd time I stay in this hotel, due to very busy schedule I made all my meetins in the hotel.
Wish I could meet same people in other hotels I stay around the world.
Upon inspecting our room, my wife found used empty shampoo bottles in the shower.
Other than that, the hotel is very nice.
Only option for a hot meal for breakfast was scrambled eggs and bacon; no oatmeal at this location, which I was looking forward to.
I normally stay in South Beach when I go to Miami, but this time I stayed at the Hilton in Downtown Miami.
King double requested with views to south or east as well as breakfast and carparking $200 / night.
Got a 4th floor room with canyon views.
No breakfast or carparking.
Rooms large and clean.
No room safe or fridge - ice down the hall.
We stayed here Saturday night before the ING Miami Marathon/ Half Marathon.
He also noted that I requested a room by an ice machine and replied that he was sorry but they did not have any rooms left.
He then upgraded me to a one-bedroom suite.
When we got up there we realized it was actually two separate rooms with a connecting door, one with a dining and sitting area, bathroom, and a gorgeous view of downtown Miami.
The other room was a regular guest room which was a good size and had a comfortable bed.
The executive lounge also had a nice view and offered hot and cold appetizers, water and soft drinks, along with wine and beer for a reasonable price.
I used to live right next to this hotel and was very impressed with the service and the accommodations.
This hotel can often be had for a deal and would be a great value.
This hotel lived up to its name and expectations!
Our room had a great view of the city.
Overall really happy with the place.
Again conference food just ok though, damn those $16 DOJ muffins Rooms a are good, big tvs, comfy beds, nice setup.
I had to spend my last night in Miami, and in Downtown I found this Hilto more convenient than the Hyatt, where I spent a couple of nights ten days before.
We found the hotel faultless, really clean, excellent service and really good value for money!
Excellent services clean and spacious rooms with great view of downtown Miami.Bar off lobby is a great hotel bar.We were given a bottle of champagne for our anniversary.The staff was very accommodating always smiling and engaging in conversation.
I have seen them taking pictures of and with several females no wonder prostitues hang around there.
We stayed at the Hilton Miami Downtown hotel for 2 nights before joining a cruise and were very happy with the hotel.
The room was spacious and bathroom clean with great views over the bay and the breakfast was awesome, the staff throughout the hotel were very polite and helpful.
The room was spacious and bathroom clean with great views over the bay and the breakfast was awesome, the staff throughout the hotel were very polite and helpful.
It did seem that it was full of business people and a couple of seminars taking place but this meant the bar was lively on the evening and the pool area was very quiet during the day so we could soak up the sun with just a couple of other people around :) Overall I would definately recommend this hotel and also stay again if we return to Miami
The hotel room is well-appointed, clean, and contains the new amenities at Hilton - Lavazza in-room coffee, thick towels, and comfortable bedding.
There is a couple of small restaurants two blocks north on Biscayne worth a try: Bin 18 and a Sushi bar.
Stayed 1 night at this hotel as my wife and I prepared to fly out to the Caribbean the next day for an extended vacation.
Room had a great city-view, it was clean, and everything worked properly.
We wanted some firmer pillows and they brought them right up.
They also gave us concierge access so a continental breakfast was available to us the next morning (not sure if it offered to everyone or to us because we were Hilton Honors members).
Breakfast was typical continental, but good.
We hung out by pool for a little bit in the morning as well, there were plenty of lounge chairs and pool was clean.
Stayed at Miami Hilton for New Years Eve 2011.
To my surprise, tge tub filled with green water.
We asked him for another room and to check it first.
We called and they said they had one room but the water was green too.
We confronted them and they gave us a full breakfast.
The breakfast was actually the highlight but the service at this hotel was disorganized and rude!
