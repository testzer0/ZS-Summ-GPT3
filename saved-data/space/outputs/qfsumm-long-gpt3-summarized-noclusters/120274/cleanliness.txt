The bed was clean and comfortable and the maid came 6 times a week.
If you're looking for a quiet night in Publix is less than a mile up the road where you can stock up on ice cream, crisps, beer & wine etc.
I checked in late Friday night with my wife and two kids.
The bedsheets had stains that looked like bodily fluids from the night before.
The towel had dead mosquitos on them.
They looked like the towels my mechanic uses at his shop.
In other words......SAVE YOUR MONEY AND STAY ELSEWHERE for the cleanliness and peace of mind of what is NOT crawling over you while you sleep!!
When we complained, the hotel manager came into our room, stomped on the cockroach and said goodnight.
The pool was clean, the room was clean, the staff was friendly...I can't ask for anything more, and certainly not for the small amount I paid.
The beds & towels were clean & as we were only there for a week & hardly spending any time in the hotel then we just put up with it.
Other reviews indicate a terrible odor We experienced the same and it was so bad we were nausiated.
All we had to do was listen to a timeshare presentation, down the street, in order to get the room... we just had to pay the taxes.
One thing to get rid of... the desk where they offer coupons if you visit their timeshare location!!
The maids would come everyday with lots of clean towels and make the beds.
Aircon was a god send as it was so hot but you definately need earplugs for the night time as you will not be able to sleep with it on.
Once I arrived though I was more than happy with my choice of accomodations.
I was unable to purchase base theme park tix at the hotel so I did so at the park itself.
They do advertise free wifi, but in reality, you have to be in the lobby and even then it doesn't work very well.
The place was clean, towels and sheets were changed.
Very Dirty!
All the towels have stains on them, some even have blood stain on it.
Scum on the showerhead, bathtub, toilet etc.
Eat as many waffles as you can.
Remember the sypup is quite fattening but look out for the basket which has low fat/sugar syrups.
We are not fussy people and we are certaintly not as one reviewer put it "moany Americans" we are from the UK and we just have standards and I would never stay in a place like this in Britain so why would you put up with it on holiday.
We got a room close to the lobby, but on a floor above, so the WiFi worked n our room, no need to go downstairs!
across the road from Quality Inn was TGI Friday we had a nice swiss steak and frys there and its a bar too we had trouble finding a bar locally.
Go to Kissimmee old town theres the biggest bunggie ride I have seen and its a nice small place.
In fact when I got back home even my clean clothes still had that smell on them!
First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.

The bedding was torn and my feet kept getting caught in the holes.
The refrigerator froze everything.
The microwave took 6 min.
It was clear upon return in Oct 2009 that standards had slipped majorly.
Breakfast was terrible, cleaning was very average.
The Receptionist was polite and helpful, as we had left some documents back in the uk, she gave us the full address of the hotel and when the documents arrived, she telephone our room to let us know.
The maid cleaned the room everyday and left fresh towels everyday if we reuqested them.
I think the smell people are saying is probably the same you get in your car when you switch it off for a bit.
I inspected every pillow , every matress , and the bathroom RIGHT away , they were all clear of ANY unwanted guests.
And slightly heated in the day , they keep it refreshing.
Linen changed almost daily.
I know this because I have stayed there in Aug 2001.
In fact they still have the same bedcovers and carpets going by the photos that have been submitted.
Not a big deal, but a little more compassion might have been shown given the amount of guests.
The air-con was blowing ice cold and the towels looked like new.
I been bite by the bedbugs before So..I can tell the redness on the arms & my Stomach area .
The housekeeping staff were excellent and kept our room spotless.
So, beware making an online reservation with this property, you will have to jump through hoops to cancel.
The pool was cleaned daily and the house keeping was excellent.
ok alot of flies but they were everywhere (front of car was covered with flies) good and clean room maid service perfect.
It was clean and seemed to be well run.
There was always plenty of it as the maid is constantly topping it all up all morning.
I didn't appreciate the bedding at all - the blankets were old and pilled and therefore I could not trust the cleanliness of the room.
The housekeeping couldn't have been more helpful .
just got back from 2 weeks at Qi, we just used it as a base to plan our disney wedding, we have stayed at the other 2 Qi's on I drive and this was by far the best, it had everthing you need around i.e dennys, walgreens etc, we could see animal kingdom from hotel so that give you idea of how close to disney, room was clean and cleaned daily, no problem with anyhting apart from what previous guests have said about limited seating for breakfast but no prob as we took it back to room!!

On-site laundry great feature for our stay.
Always had clean towels and linens.
Always had clean towels and linens.
We would leave a tip for housekeeping because hey... someone else is cleaning up after my family so for this I am quite grateful!
Now for the negatives again keeping in mind we were able secure a great price for our stay so negatives are very few in our minds Wi-fi does not go much further than the lobby we already knew this from prior reviews and it really didn't matter.
Dunkin donut down the street is really good.
Payed half the price for two attractions and one water park for four people going to a timeshare ???
Also, look inside pillow cases and pull sheets up quickly and look for anything running.
We grabbed donuts.
The carpets were nasty, the bathroom was dirty and nasty, nold was growing on the desk chair, saw 3 bugs, the furniture was worn out, dirty behind the bed.
It was cleaned everyday, the safe was free (bonus) and the beds were the most comfortablist (?)
After a week we decided to move to a nearbye townhose on the Emerald Isle estate and enjoy the extra space that this type of accomodation gave.
We arrived at hotel at 1pm was told to come back at 3 because no rooms were available at that time.
Check in went very smooth.
The air conditioner worked great, the shower water was hot and had decent pressure, and they provided shampoo and mini bar soaps.
Especially the (only little) lizards.
We were too scared to go on the hulk ride, please don't share the same regrets.
However if the slightest sign of dirt or grime gives you cause to reach for the phone and call reception, I would pass on this hotel for 2 reasons.
To sum up, ok accomodation if you only want somewhere reasonably clean to sleep (and the free breakfast is a good cost saver).
Give it a miss though if you are a hygiene freak, or if you expect to spend time at poolside or hanging out in the hotel!
