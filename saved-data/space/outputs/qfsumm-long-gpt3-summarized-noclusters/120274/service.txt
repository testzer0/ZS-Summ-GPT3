Aspect: service
***** Model produced summary *****
The service was great, with the maid coming 6 times a week. The location was a little out of the way, but it was only 5 minutes from Disney. The TV had premium HBO channels.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The staff are fast, friendly & provide a good service. The guest services stand was helpful. The reception staff was mostly very pleasant and helpful, except for one older woman who was abrupt and unhelpful. Otherwise, the housekeeping and ticket agents were the best!The directions given by the hotel staff were also very clear.
***** Golden Review 2 *****

***** Sentences in Cluster ****
All the staff were extremely helpful, friendly and approachable.
I slept on a towel with my clothes on.
Clean towels everyday, rooms & beds made everyday.
Don't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney!
Also, they hit you up with some kind of $1.86 a night fee tacked onto your bill...surprise!
The evening clerk was a little weak in communicating in English so I really didn't get an adequate explanation of the charge.
I booked this hotel online for dirt cheap...and that's what I got...dirt and the bugs that go alone with it!
Complained to head office and they didn't even respond.
STEER CLEAR!!
The wireless internet--somewhat annoying to have to go to the lobby, since it doesn't reach to the rooms.
(the rep was unable to come around til 3 days into the holiday anyway!)
I think the holiday company are really ripping folk of with what they charge if you get this hotel.
Luckily we had a car so did not have to rely on shuttle buses.
I was in Disney World in less than 10 minutes.
Web site with photos, etc.
The shuttle service (free) was on time (give or take 10 mins) to the theme parks.
We didn't have a car so it worked with the shuttle to the parks (although it took a really long time!)
the rooms are ok the service is ok the breakfast is ok.
A free bus was provided to the parks but we just used our car.
Also the guys at the front desk were helpful, and the park tickets and advice given were of great help (for my wallet as well).
hotel staff is fast,efficiant,& most of all friendly, i would not recommend this hotel to a friend,but i would recommend to all my friends thankyou Eugene V .
Once we arrived, the staff was friendly and welcoming with a guest service stand willing to help.
The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
this was not true as you needed to dial the area code just to make a local call.
over $12.00 was added to our room bill due to the "free local calls".
I visited this website after booking the trip and thought i had made a dreadful mistake.
The staff were friendly and we were in our rooms within 10 minutes.
The Hotel does provide free shuttle buses to Sea world, Universal/Islands of Adventure & to the Epcot Centre (transfer by Monorail at Epcot for the other Disney parks).
One day, the bus was so overcrowded that i would say it was very dangerous (approx 40 people standing in the centre isle).
Hospitality can't fault clean sheets and towels daily also complimentry shampoo and soap.
Staff pleasant and helpfull.
Rooms were clean, grounds were clean, staff was friendly.
The bonus was that there was a FREE digital safe which is a must any where to travel.
The staff are friendly as well.
If your phone charger does not work (like mine) go to the reception and say that you left your charger the last time you stayed any they will be more than happy to take you to a room full to the roof of 2 pin phone chargers, it may take you hrs.
free ice is available from the corridor and laundry is available.
The reception staff, housekeeping and ticket agents were the best!
They made me feel very welcome and more to the point I felt safe.
If you're not happy with something, say so-they will sort it.
The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
We had other plans and traveled 2,000 miles all week.
I did not feel safe here at all.
Beware the hotel's own website which says "All guestrooms are handsomely and newly furnished with Refrigerator, microwave....".
Reception staff mostly very pleasant and helpful except for one older woman who was abrupt and unhelpful.
Maid service is brilliant clean towels everyday and beds made.
staff on the front desk very helpful.
We wanted to go to International drive to see all the shops but we ended up after taking four buses at a mall still it was a sight.
Hotel does supply free shuttle buses to all theme parks which go every day and you don't have to bye your tickets from the guest services at the front of the hotel happy holidays.
There were maybe six channels available...
It was sooo much fun going thru everything I had taken outside my home before entering with my belongings.
Won't stay there again!
Be warned, I needed the internet for my school work, you must go to the lobby it is not available in the rooms.
Free internet is only in Lobby.
Maintainance too was super quick.
I needed some help with the in room safe and someone arrived seconds after I put down the phone.
From previous experience from other hotels they usually only have limited pick ups for the parks.
Front desk polite , but not eager to help.
Guest services, at the other desk , were VERY helpful in planning our trip and WDW visits.
This hotel is far from florida mall , with no shuttle service there .
there are FREE shuttle rides to the outlets which are very fun to visit.
We got a number from a shuttle driver for his private transportaion company for a 40$ only ride to the airport , instead of the regular 52$ ride with the time meter.
email me if you would like the number.
The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
his hotel was had very disappointing customer service and staff.
First, the shuttle service they offered took us to the wrong theme park 40 minutes late without any explanation.
The 9:00 PM shuttle did not show up so we waited till 10:40 for the 10:30 bus to show up.
We asked to meet with the manager by appointment about it and asked for her the following day.
The front desk refused to let us see her stating that the shuttle is not the manager's responsibility.
Instead of listening to what we had to say, she continually interuppted us mid-sentence and told us we were wrong.
I have never met a manager who actually YELLED at a customer till i met her.
She told us she didn't believe us because we were the only people who have complained about this situation.
All staff (maids, grounds and desk) were cheery and polite.
Shuttle to LBV outlets.
There is also free shuttle buses to the parks but can get full as they pick up from several places.
Landscaping was terrible,elevators were dirty and anywhere outside of the room was not well maintained.
After the sherrif arrived nobody even made it to our room to check on us or offer a different room.
Service was promptly cut off at 10 AM although several guests were still trying to eat.
My biggest complaint was the lack of internet service.
Service is only available in one of the three buildings.
It meant you needed to sit in the lobby/dining area for wireless service.
The staff was great, the cost reasonable, you could do worse.
We gave them a second chance.
We definetely complained, but the counter staff gave us the choice of cleaning supplies to clean ourselves, because the cleaning staff is off at night time.
Never ever use them again!
We had a car but their is a shuttle for the Theme Parks.
The air-con was blowing ice cold and the towels looked like new.
The staff were friendly and helpfull.
Web site with photos, etc.
Internet access are only way at the hotel Lobby, theirs is NO internet access in the room at all , so..you have bring ur laptop to the lobby !!
Front desk was also very courteous and helpful whenever I called.
Staff are helpful and generally friendly.
We flew in from California to go to one of the theme parks while waiting for time to board for a cruise from Port Canaveral.
The hotel refused to match multiple lower rates I had found elsewhere, so I decided to cancel due to unhelpful reservation services and reserve a hotel I KNOW has superior customer service.
If it is this hard to get something accomplished over the phone its obvious customer service is not a priority at this property and i will be too tired to deal with anything less than quality customer service upon my arrival.
They have one person manning the front desk AND reservations and he refused to escalate my issue to the general manager who apparently doesn't remain at the property at 3:45PM on a weekday as he manages THREE OTHER PROPERTIES.
The air con.
We normally go on 5 star cruises and we are all fussy and expect our moneys worth.
Everyone at the hotel was pleasant and helpful.
If you do go here dont forget the free newspaper in the reception every morning.
It was very clean and our room was ok. the staff were very freindly and the only bad report that we have is with the shuttle busses.
We didn't want to drive so we relied on these and they took ages and were in a very bed condition.
however this is not the hotels fault but Disney as they put on the transport.
This hotel was great, if you phoned or reported a problem to the front desk someone turned up in under ten minutes to fix it.
I have just been reviewing some of the comments by some of your members, and feel that I should add my wife's & my own remarks.
The staff are pleasant and if there is a technical problem, maintenance arrives promptly.
We complained to the manager and were promptly offered another room.
Apart from this initial hickup our stay was uneventful, the staff was friendly and helpful.
The staff were very helpful.
Our rooms were cleaned daily and our sheets and towels were changed daily too.
The staff was friendly enough.
Pros: - The room was spacy & clean - The pool was warm and fun to swim in - Friendly staff - Good location (next to some great shops!)
The very kind and helpful Dario, who was at the the front desk that afternoon, honored all my requirements and we were more than happy with the room assigned.
free internet access, etc etc.
if you want anymore information just E mail me!!
The staff were always friendly and helpful.
Keeping in mind that we did not travel to Florida for a hotel room.
Close to parks...free shuttle to attractions but buses get full fast, they pick up at other hotels along the way.
Might have to wait for second bus.
Dont walk - RUN no matter how much money you save.
The staff was exteremly rude, rooms out dated and smelled!
Maintenace came and sprayed floor and when we woke the next morning there were ants on nightstand, dresser, bathroom walls and shower.
I also examined their website which includes very little information.
The hotel offers free shuttle bus to the theme parks also, but the bus departs from the hotel at 8:40a.m.
I took the free shuttle bus to the theme parks and expected to get to the entrance before 9:00a.m.
It is just a free service.
Flights great - would quite happily fly long haul with First Choice/Thomson Airways again.
Reception staff were not the friendliest but did suggest having 3rd (top) floor room to prevent any noise from above.
CAR NEEDED, although there is a free shuttle to some parks.
I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!
