***** Model produced summary *****
The food at the Rainforest Cafe was great, the Hardrock Cafe was also great, and Bennigan's was great. The location was a little out of the way for Universal, but it was only 5 minutes from Disney. This was our 5th visit to Orlando and our first budget trip and we have to say that this little gem of a hotel is far superior to other more expensive ones in the area. Our room had a brand new air conditioning unit which was quite than the ones we are used to, a microwave, fridge, freezer, hair dryer, safe and TV. There are a zillion places to eat along the 192, Ponderosa is great for its huge buffet breakfast and filling up before a day at the parks. We were upgraded to a king size room without even asking and our checkout was extended to 1 pm without any problems. The TV had premium HBO channels (perfect for after a hectic day at the parks). We came into town to get an early start the next day at Disney. The bed was clean and comfortable and the maid came 6 times a week.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The hotels simple continental breakfast was good. However, it was sometimes hard to get a seat.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The breakfast is plain cereal, toast coffee and juice, but it was good.. more than most free continentals. The best part was that the breakfast is free!!!
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The continental breakfast, while free and delicious, was very basic- toast, cereal, coffee, and juice.

There are a zillion places to eat along the 192, Ponderosa is great for it's huge buffet breakfast and filling up before a day at the parks.
At the end of the day you only get what you pay for.
No in-room coffee makers, either.
I guess as the saying goes you get what you pay for as we didn't pay much for the 4 of us we were pleased and surprised.
I 'm not a huge eater so I did'nt need a nasty greasy morning breakfast.
The orange juiced was bad & watered down, but I only drank coffee which was good.
If we wanted more we would go to the Ponderosa just down the road.
it cost £530 for both of us.
Area around isn't bad we had a different restaurant every night of our 14night stay, try the corral more than you can eat for $6.99 and I mean more than you can eat food was really nice, red lobster was good so was the minning company.
The hotel stay cost about $100.00 to stay 4 nights through a promotion for free nights so I was impressed with the price!
(especially because the Shoneys and Denny's nearby are NIGHTMARES!)
to reheat a slice of pizza...
Was I really paying less than $ 20 a night?!!
We found old, moldy juice bottles under our beds.
supermarket across the street , to fill up your hotel fridge with fruit and drinks.
As a canadian , i am not used to eating in food chains and steakhouses all the time , and felt a great need to go buy fruit and salad at the market , to get my daily greens in.
Bring tupperware , to be able to eat in.
You get what you pay for, and it was cheap but that's just about it.
I booked this hotel as it was cheapest available.
A good place to fuel up for the long days at the parks.
There are countless places to eat around the hotel & there's an all you can eat chinese buffet next door that's good.
We booked this trough expedia and only paid £19 a night.
We thought OK that sounds fair.
We had to pay 25 cent for ice but you can't have every thing.
There was only coffee, juice, toast and cerial.
We were a little disappointed that the water did not seem as hot as in our previous visits, on our most recent visit - maybe we were just unlucky !
The price is right, and the location is super!
For the price we paid, what more could you ask for?
Coffee was bad.
They come off very easy and the bugs are easy to see.
there's a product called [--].
Water tastes like sulfur or burnt hair.
Ask for cups of water from concession stands or to fill a water bottle.
every park, disney or not, will do this for free and water tastes MUCH better.
we also brought food in a small cooler bag and saved a lot of money.
We were on a budget so this place was perfect for the price.
Often all the tables would be full and the bread was often finished before the breakfast session finished.
When we went to the front desk they told us it was because of us having sweets in room of which we had none.
I paid $25.00/night after a good deal I found on Hotels.com!!!
It WAS free, and we DID pay $25.00 per night, so I can't complain too much.
They offered Frosted Flakes, and Wheat Bread (with a toaster) as our choices.
There was coffee and the condiments that go with.
I didn't try it myself.
There are loads of places to eat locally, although you will have trouble if you want 5% healthy food 5% of the time.
Sick of fatty junk food after the second day, and despite our quest to eat in a half respectable fashion, no luck was had.
We were not being overly fussy, the chinese eat as much as you can next door is highly recommended.
