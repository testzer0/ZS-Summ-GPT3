Aspect: rooms
***** Model produced summary *****
Overall, reviewers thought the rooms were decent-sized, with good prices and excellent service. Some prints on the walls were not to everyone's taste, but the public spaces were nicely decorated. There was a view from the room (at least in some cases), and the location was both convenient and away from traffic. Check-in was friendly and efficient.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The rooms are spacious, clean and each with a small balcony and most have a view of the creek. Bed and bedding are amazingly comfortable and of high quality. The luxurious bathroom includes an amazing ceiling shower head. You can find also a little bar area with sink, microwave and mini fridge.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The rooms are spacious and beautiful, with balconies looking over the water. The beds were high quality and very comfortable. The bathrooms are huge, and clean, and the shower is lovely.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The rooms are large, clean, pretty, and comfortable. The water views, loads of windows, small balcony, and modern decor were all pleasing. So were the luxurious showers, kitchenette with microwave, large beds, and comfortable bedding.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
We enjoyed a quick, one-night visit to Vancouver, and stayed at the Granville Island Hotel.
To get there, we took the quick little ferry from downtown, and walked with our rolling suitcases to the hotel, conveniently located and yet away from any traffic.
It's a calm, well-designed "boutique" hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island.
Those small issues aside, this is a lovely hotel in a great area, close to the attractions of Vancouver yet far enough away to provide solace.
I've stayed here frequently and will continue to do so when I travel to Vancouver!
The hotel is very good, with decent sized rooms, great prices and excellent service!
I love the lounge and the micro brew beer!
This is my second visit to Granville Island Hotel in eight years and both times have been exceptional; last time I didn’t know about tripadvisor though!
I looked at a few different rooms and they vary in size and view.
They’re currently renovating all the bathrooms and the new look is beautiful; even nicer than the Hyatt Regency where I stayed a few days prior to this hotel.
All the rooms have been remodeled with nice big screen TVs, very comfortable beds and nice décor.
Even the bathrooms in the rooms where the bathrooms have not yet been remodeled are still very nice.
I recommend room 326… vaulted ceiling with cedar beams, king bed, wet bar and a fantastic water view… at a standard room price.
I also recommend the huevos rancheros for breakfast.
In Vancouver, I’ll only stay here from now on.
On several occasions we have visited Granville Island, and on at least one occasion have eaten at the Granville Island Hotel.
We had however never stayed at this hotel until this weekend.
It was very hard to leave.
Most everything else about the hotel was great as well - the size of our room, the friendly staff, a great dinner and breakfast, again with outstanding views from the dining room.
We only have two comments - we were planning on a "nightcap" when we got back from the theatre on a Saturday night at 10:30 - only to discover that both the dining room and the lounge were closed at this early hour.
Staying at the Grandville Island hotel always makes my stay in Vancouver a special experience.
I love this property.
The hotel is really nice and the staff are friendly and helpful.
The standard room was very good, on the ground floor overlooking the patio area, and we would have happily stayed there if the king suite had been unavailable.
However, we really wanted a room on the 2nd floor with a view over False creek, so changed on night 2.
The hotel itself was average plus, but as I mentioned the location nails it.
Seems the rooms were a bit limited when we stayed so the room wasn't as much as I had hoped.
I love the setting of this hotel.
I had a room with a partial view and it was very nice.
If you're looking to stay at a big hi-rise in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown, then this place is not for you.
If you're looking for a smaller (decent sized) hotel with a relaxed environment (not to mention romantic), and is a 3 minute drive (5 minute water taxi ride) from downtown Vancouver, then this IS the hotel for you.
We stayed in an executive suite, which had a separate living room, and was facing the water and downtown Vancouver... an excellent view.
If you're going to stay for more than one night, I would highly recommend spending the extra few bucks for the upgrade.
I've stayed in all types, all ratings of hotels around the world and I rank Granville Island Hotel as one of my top picks due to the location and relaxed environment... especially for an adult getaway.
Suite was amazing with views over the false creek harbour and city skyline.
Very peacful at night and sitting by the fire in the bar prior to dinner was so relaxing.
My husband and I pored over hotels to choose one for our honeymoon.
We finally settled on a penthouse suite here and absolutely could not have been more pleased.
The balcony had impressive views and was private, the suite was huge and very comfortable.
The pillows and bed were amazing; we slept better than ever!
They put new fresh flowers in the room every few days.
If we ever come back to Vancouver, we would not consider staying anywhere else.
The only hotel there, so book early.
Since we'd heard that the rooms can vary in size and view, we requested (at booking) a larger room and a nice view, both of which were accommodated by the hotel.
The rooms were very clean and comfortable.
The walls were thick and the hotel had a quiet but friendly feel to it.
The rooms are clean and comfortable, the bathrooms very nice (love the shower!).
We had wished the room had a fridge that could be used rather than one stocked with liquor.
The rooms are quite small, which was a little tight with two kids and my wife and me.
The hotel was reasonable value, and in a great location.
We had breakfast each morning at Granville Island which is always pleasant (earlier in the day the better when its not busy.)
We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel on 25th May 2006.
We just wanted some where to stay for one night before we began our tour of Britsivh Columbia.
It was OK for this purpose.
Just somewhere to sleep.
Granville Island market is a great place for breakfast, but I would suggest that if your stay is for more than one night, you choose another hotel.
We stayed in 6 hotels in all and this was by no means the cheapest, but it was the least appealing.
We recently stayed at the Granville Island Hotel and it was fabulous!
We had been to Vancouver Island two times in the past and have always wanted to stay at this hotel but couldn't get in.
This time I planned ahead and we had an amazing time both at the hotel and enjoying all that Granville Island has to offer!
Thank you so much...I can't wait to go back!
Stayed at the Granville Island Hotel for a conference meeting.
The hotel is very modern, with the feel of a boutique 5 star hotel.
Hotel also has a sauna and hot tub for use.
The rooms are very clean, equipped with large flat screen TV and complimentary internet.
This hotel is great if you want to explore granville island.
Our room was clean and large.
We had been to granville before but this was the first time we stayed at the hotel.
walk everywhere and return to your room for a drink and a hot tub when you are done.
Myself and my husband stayed here September 6th and 7th.
The bed and bedding was amazingly comfortable and appeared to be very high quality.
Even though we're local, we've stayed here a few times when we've turned our place over to out-of-town family.
The room we stayed in had a superb view over the marina at the back of the hotel.
The bed was huge and the room a good size.
We has breakfast at the hotel twice.
Highly recommended.
We also sat on the balcony of our room to watch the boats go by and enjoy the view.
The rooms were well appointed.
We especially loved the modern shower with rainfall, massage, and regular options.
We will definitely return to Granville Island Hotel
I discovered the fantastic European-influenced, waterfront, dog-friendly Granville Island Hotel and have been back every year for Christmas Eve through Boxing Day ever since (with one exception.)
I've stayed in a number of different rooms and though I have my favorite I have been quite comfortable in each and every one of them.
The marble tile floors in the rooms make for easy management of the pet-friendly policy, so I don't mark this hotel down for that as some other reviewers have mentioned.
right on the property and have had several dinners there.
What a treat!!
DATE: October 21, 2005; October 28-30, 2005 Initially stayed for one night at the Granville Island Hotel when we first arrived in Vancouver.
Returning to Vancouver we returned to the Granville Island Hotel for the remainder of our trip.
We found this charming hotel to be more than we anticipated.
The rooms in the section away from the Front Desk by the banquet rooms seemed larger than those in the wing closer to the Front Desk.
The bathrooms in the newer section had more counter space to place personal toiletries.
That aside, the rooms were very clean and provided all the amenities needed to help make our stay quite comfortable.
Hairdryers were provided along with lighted magnifying make-up mirrors (we found in the larger rooms).
We will DEFINITELY return to the Granville Island Hotel.
Checked into the hotel on Granville Island for a 3 night stay and our first reaction was WOW!
A beautiful large modern style room with lots of windows.
Great kind bed with very nice soft linens and fluffy towels.
Best shower ...the bathroom was huge with an amazing huge ceiling shower head.
Feedback on the guest rooms from our out of town attendees was excellent.
We love staying at the ranville Island Hotel.
If that sounds like how you want to spend a few days in Vancouver then the Granville Island Inn is the hotel for you.
For one it is the only hotel on the island and two it is a very nice hotel.
The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.
This is not a five star hotel but you are not paying five star prices and as stated above the location is awesome.
My rating would have been 5 stars, except the room was quite small for two people 5 days, and the only view was over a roof and hvac unit.
This was our fifth Christmas getaway at the hotel.
The rooms are large, each with a small balcony and most have a view of the water.
We were initially worried as our room was adjacent to the patio and we feared lots of noise, but it was quiet after 10 pm, the beds were great and we both a great sleep, and really enjoyed visiting the market before we left for Kelowna.
I lived in Vancouver, and when I go back, this is for sure the first hotel I am looking for.
The hotel is nice, the restaurant is great, and it is really central.
I'm almost reluctant to write this review, because I don't want prices at this great little hotel to go up.
The standard room was a good size, clean and attractive.
Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
We felt that we really made the right choice to stay at Granville Island Hotel.
I requested a room with a view and a rain shower and a king bed and I recieved all my requests, I was very pleased.
The room was beautiful, the staff were very pleasant and the food from the restiarant Downstairs was delicious.
The room was so tiny we could hardly fit in it.
No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.
We requested a larger room, since we were a group of three, previously booked and wanting an adequate room.
We were told none were available.
The room was small and dark and old.
First, I need to mention how helpful the folks at the front desk were.
My room - 316.
I wish that there were a way to turn off the outside lights, however, so that I could leave the curtains open at night to catch the lights from the buildings across False Creek.
I will totally ask for that room again.
This is a wonderful hotel with really nice staff and is a beautiful place to go for a drink or to stay.
We arrived after a 9 hour flight from London on our honeymoon and thanks to our bestman the hotel knew about this and upgraded us.Then later in the evening the booking for the penthouse was cancelled, and guy at the desk asked if we would like to move.
This is a very well set up hotel.
My kids thought they were in heaven with such a large suite.
We had our Xmas dinner at the hotel and even though it was a little pricey, we had a nice dinner.
The best part of the hotel is being able to walk to the Public Market where you can find everything you need to prepare a wonderful meal (like a picnic with wine, cheese, bread, fruits, meats, etc) or you could just eat at the many food stalls.
Our room with king bed was incredibly comfortable, easy to temperature control, well-lit and well-equipped.
The shower fixture although very smart looking are hard to use and are very sharp due to the sharp and clean lines of design.
As I said the rooms are too small for all that furniture.
* The doors, wallpaper and carpets need to be redone.
The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
The floors throughout are marble with an occasional scatter rug.
Our room was adequate.
Kind size bed, tv, marble floors small scatter rug on either side of the bed.
We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel for one night in late September prior to embarking on a cruise.
The hotel was well appointed, our room comfortable and decorated in a traditional style.
There was a small balcony and we could see the water and boats both from our window and the balcony.
The room was quiet and we did not notice any noise from "neighbors".
The bath included a bidet.
The Hotel ordered one for us and it arrived well within the time frame given -- 5-10 minutes.
And what kind of hotel charges for local calls?!
Oh, and the sauna was broken.
We had a great room at the end of the hall with a king size bed, and a connecting door to a smaller room with two doubles.
The end room is great because even though it's small, 2 walls are window-sliders to balconies overlooking ritzy boats and water traffic.
Bathrooms are super-luxorious.
Beds are lush.
While at the hotel we hosted a dinner for 30 people in the Dockside and everybody that I spoke with raved about the dinner,even the locals who had never been there are very keen to come back.
We splurged when we stayed here and it was worth every penny.
Our room was most comfortable and with its amenities, left nothing to be desired This is simply a first class hotel.
The Granville Island Hotel is a great little place to stay if you don't want the big city experience, and you like walking out your door to the marketplace, coffee shops, galleries and outdoor spaces that surround you on this interesting island.
The hotel is showing some signs of age, but the truly wonderful restaurant, cheery staff, and easy access to the city make this a hotel that every Vancouver visitor should try at least once.
Last time we were in town in April it was full up.
We got lucky and bought a 3 day package and stayed in one of the suites.
My wife and I were sooo relaxed and slept like babies on the RestWell bed.
I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
Same quality as a Sandman hotel but paid $250 per night for the room.
It was an acceptable hotel, but definitely not worth the outlandish price.
I really loved this hotel.
The hotel itself is reasonably priced, has very open meeting rooms with doors directly outside.
The rooms are VERY clean (very), and the bathrooms are quite luxurious.
We LOVE the Granville Island Hotel-------------------stayed there a lot last year while purchasing the Rainbow Hunter, and were so excited to be back last weekend!!
you can set off on serious walks or just hang out and watch the local water scene.
We stayed overnight in one of the rooms which was on the small side, but beautiful views and excellent room service for breakfast the following morning.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, Alexandra MceKenzie, Sales & Catering Coordinator and all the staff to anyone looking to plan a magical event in a most beautiful setting.
We arrived from the UK tired and, hungry, and dirty, and found to our delight that we had been upgraded to a penthouse suite.
The staff were very apologetic about the fire that had temporarily closed the restaurant, but when we saw our room, we forgot all about food.
It was vast, with a dining room, 2 bathrooms - and a jacuzzi in the bedroom!
We were so comfortable in the hotel that it was hard to leave it to join our cruise ship (where the bed was far less comfortable).
The hotel brought in free pastries and coffee every morning, while the restaurant was being refurbished.
The hotel setting is very nice with water and dock views.
The room was very nice, clean and new, a tad on the small side, but fine.
High end bathroom fixtures, comfortable bed with premium linens, free wifi.
My room was very quiet.
Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling.
We will definately stay here again.
The hotel was cute, trendy and in an amazing location.
We had a balcony with chairs to sit outside in the sun and watch the city.
The bathroom was very nice.
Great Place.
This was definately the best hotel in the city.
It had views of the harbour and the rooms were absolutely beautiful -- nice marble floors too.
The front desk will help you arrange any travel plans and are experts on the area.
That being said, my room was only okay.
I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
We stayed for 2 nights in one of the penthouse suites facing downtown Vancouver.
The room was beautiful and very spacious with amazing views of False Creek.
Our room was very quiet and well appointed.
The bedroom area is so sound proof that we couldn't hear each other talk in separate rooms.
There are wrap-around balconies off every room with chairs and a table.
After living in Vancouver for several years, then coming back to visit, we found this hotel gave us an entirely different perspective of the city - one that we fully appreciated!
Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc.
I would definitely come back to this hotel and bring my kids next time!
The rooms are somewhat small and quite expensive considering the size.
We stay at the hotel mainly because we like to shop at Granville Island.
We appreciated the favourable room rate we got because of the course at Maiwa that my wife was taking.
Our room was fantastic, especially for the price paid.
It was huge, comfortable ,clean, nicely decorated and with great views over the boats of False Creek.
Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
I was so glad that we hadn't booked one of the bigger, high rise downtown hotels.
I would definately recommend the hotel and the area to anyone planning a trip to Vancouver.
There are many pluses for this hotel, but a few caveats: .
The rooms are small and sparsely furnished.
However the hotel is very nice, and the staff very helpful.
A hotel with its own brewery, how can you go wrong?
Seriously, we go to Vancouver BC at least once a year and have been staying at the Granville Island Hotel for the past four years.
We reserved a room with the internet special price of $135 CN through the hotel's web site.
Our room was clean and comfortable with a king-size bed.
In fact, I'm anxious to see how it looks the next time we stay.
We're the sort of travelers who aren't interested in luxury and a lot of amenities with our accommodations.
We use hotels to sleep and shower when we're on vacation.
If you're that sort of traveler, too, this hotel is a great option for your trip to Vancouver.
The beds and Bathrooms are both quite nice.
The beds and Bathrooms are both quite nice.
If possible try to get a room overlooking the water.
The rooms on the third floor (top floor) tend to be nicer than the others.
For breakfast check out the market just close to the hotel on the island.
Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!
Got room twice the sz with a balcony & view - MUCH better :-) This is close to everything,GR8 4 kids, couples, walking, hopping, coffee, food, farmer's market, easy acess to bridges, residential, ferries across water to downtown, yaletown, science world.
My husband and I spent five nights at the Granville Island Hotel, selecting it based on reviews from this site, and we were delighted.
The first night we were in a smaller room without a view, which was quite small, and upon request, they moved us the next morning to a larger room with a balcony and great view without any charges.
There are plenty of paths to jog and walk around the water, and lots of choices for dinner and drinks.
Very close by are two HUGE beachside public pools as well.
This is a fantastic site to walk around, have a bike ride, visit the ocean, go shopping, go on a small bot tour, its all available next to the Granville Island Hotel.
I have stayed here before but my preferred room was not available.
I accepted 211 but should have negotiated for a different room.
Informed then at the desk on my return.
Hotel was friendly, staff helpful, room lovely, bathroom really lovely, restaurant and bar great food and drink and service.
We stayed at this hotel on the way to our cruise boat to Alaska.
We liked it so we book a room for the day we got back from Alaska also.
We chose this hotel for the last 4 nights of our 2-week holiday and were not disappointed.
Our room was on the ground floor, and I was initially worried it might be noisy as it had a view of the waiter's water station for the outside patio, but in fact it was very quiet, and we could glimpse the water through the shrubs which preserved our privacy, as well as people-watching.
We had a room with 2 double beds for my husband and myself and our two boys (12 and 6), and the space was comfortable (though not generous) for the 4 of us, even when returning to the room for some "down time".
Didn't try the breakfast we we tended to buy things from the market and eat them outside.
If you're staying over a weekend I recommend booking for dinner as it was packed on Saturday night and Sunday lunchtime.
I had a room with a view of False Creek, comfy beds, pleasant decor, windows that open.
We were told that we had been upgraded to a suite.
It was a very nice room with a beautiful view of the waterfront.
In the other part of the room, we could sleep or just have breakfast in bed while watching the other television in the room.
We enjoyed a good lunch.
And then we wandered around the shops of Granville Island.
Overall, it was a romantic Thursday night at the Granville Island Hotel!
The Hotel is easy to get to from the Airport, Check-in was smooth, and the staff was very helpful.
Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
My wife and I stayed here, for a weekend, based on trip advisor recommendations.
The only drawback could be room size as ours was only just adequate and the view was rather restricted.
But we would stay here again.
We stayed here for one night on July 30th after reading all the good reviews of this hotel.
I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
The hotel is perfectly acceptable, but does not stand out.
We stayed in room 319 which was of average size for the hotel.
The room was the smallest we stayed in during our tour of western Canada, and it was a struggle to fit in a rollaway bed for my son.
The rooms are fairly well equipped, and on the surface look good, however the fittings when you look closely at them are not top quality, and will not last.
We also stayed at the Slyvia Hotel in the West end, next door to Stanley Park, and that was much better value, both in regard to location, and space.
After studying tripadvisor for some time we decided to make the best of our single-night stay in Vancouver by booking the Granville Island Hotel and we were not let down.
Its a bit old and some of the furnishings and fabrics in the room showed their age, but its clean and quiet and the mattress was comfortable.
All the rooms have some view of the water and although they are small and expensive it is worth it.
The Granville Island Hotel allows you to view it from one of the best locations in Vancouver ... Granville Island.
This really is a fabulous hotel.
It's in a perfect location, it's been recently updated, it's very clean, it has a lovely patio to enjoy the views from, it's located on Granville Island with it's many charming spots to shop, dine and enjoy the fabulous farmers market, it really couldn't be better.
My wife and i keep coming back, and every time we stay we think how lucky we are to have found this hotel.
You won't be disappointed.
We try to stay at the Granville Island Hotel whenever we travel to Vancouver.
Not a bad hotel.
Room was quite small, with very limited closet space, especially for 2 adults and a child.
All in all, if I had to return to Vancouver I would think about staying here again.
We spent two nights here and were not dissapointed.
The room also had a weird smell.
I'm assuming the previous occupant was a negligent pet owner and allowed their pet to do their business everywhere in the room.
We asked for another room right away and managed to get something that was equivalent to the one we had.
The good stuff: the rooms are clean and tidy.
Didn't try out the pool.
It was convienient to grab breakfast from the Granville Market and the restaurants in Granville are excellent.
And the hotel is a $10 cab ride from downtown or you can take a water taxi to the edge of the downtown area.
Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel.
The rooms themselves are spacious, we had a king-size bed, with a little balcony that looked out towards downtown.
Like the wonky shower head.
So if the hotel itself is real important and you intend to spend alot of time in the room itself, I don't recommend this hotel to you.
But if you spend very little time in the hotel, as we generally do, then it is just OK and sometimes even better than just OK when you look at the lights of downtown at night over the water.
When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.
The rooms are incredibly small.
They need to update the place, but since it is the only hotel on Granville Island I think they are in no rush!
The hotel is located on Granville Island in the heart of Vancouver.
Living in the 'burbs' of Vancouver, my wife and I enjoy staying at the Granville Island Hotel as our home away from home.
We find the hotel rooms well appointed and comfortable; the staff friendly and accomodating.
We have on occasion had many out of town guests attend a celebration or reunion and have not hesitated to recommend the Granville Island Hotel for their stay in Vancouver.
The Granville Island Hotel continues to be one of our favourites.
I stayed at the hotel for a business seminar that was being held nearby.
I couldn't stay at the seminar site as the hotel was booked solid from ongoing renovations.
The hotel was a short ride from the airport and the staff were very pleasant upon check-in and check-out.
Free wi-fi was accessed with ease and the bed was lavish.
The location, the artistic vibe, the fantastic food (the market in our opinion is much better than Pike Place in Seattle that we visited earlier in the week) and this hotel.
This hotel is one of Vancouver's best.
I have been staying at this hotel on a regular basis for a number of years and continue to really enjoy the experience.
As I live in the UK I almost regard the hotel as my second home!
We had a superior room over looking the patio restaurant and False Creek.
The room was very spacious with a lovely king size bed and nice toiletries, replenished daily.
The Granville Island Hotel was overall really nice.
The room itself was clean, the bathroom was very modern, and the views of the water/harbor were very pretty.
This superb hotel on Granville Island is hard to beat.
Secondly, the room was well equipped, the decor tasteful and the bed was extremely comfortable.
At the end of a tiring day, the hotel hot tub is the ideal place to unwind and ease those aching limbs.
I didn't try the gym equipment.
Staying at the Granville Island Hotel was a real highlight of my Canadian tour, and I was very sad to be leaving.
It is a mash up of 80s smoked glass and more recent upgrades and pseudo renovations.
Big rooms with lots of windows.
My 8 year old could throw a rock into the water from our room but might hit one of the dozens of boats bobbing outside our window.
Big clean remodelled bathroom.
3 balconies.
we have a superior room but the view and location can't be beat.
