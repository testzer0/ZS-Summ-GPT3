what makes is worse is the drunk people returning to there rooms from 12am to 5am.
they like to stay there for a night or 2. saturday night i took ny-quil so that i could stay asleep and had no issue that night.
the club is the only negative i could find here, and thats only friday and saturday night.
makes for a rough nights sleep.
I would recommend staying on a floor higher than 10, I am a light sleeper and woke up at 230-330 AM after the bars let out and there was a lot of noise below!
They had set up late checkout for us which was great, very nice to lounge until 1.
Cons: Saturday night was very noisy-- club on street just below the hotel had noise that was heard even on my upper floor room with windows closed.
I would stay again if coming to Toronto
Be aware that this is in the club district so be prepared to encounter drunk people on the weekend stumbling about.
They let you take some take out back to the room.
Arrived early before noon and didn't expect to be able to check in but was able to leave cars in hotel parking with our bags and were told to return after the game and we could check in.
The four kids, and the adults, were all tired of this.
We were allowed to check in a couple of hours earlier which helped us a lot (to drop off the luggage).
There was a little noise in the adjacent rooms, walls are paper-thin as in most hotels.
Recommended!
The only issue was that it was VERY NOISY at night having multiple clubs right outside the front doors.
We were on the 15th floor and it still carried up and made it hard to sleep.
If you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs.. the hotel should just warn people ahead of time or have ear plugs in the rooms as a courtesy.
I would recommend this hotel but wouldnt stay there again on a night the clubs are open.
and her friend and myself and a friend).
They let us have early check in and late check out.

We would love to come back.
We were able to walk to everything in Toronto.
It was also VERY quiet.
I was checking in and waiting while one of the people at the desk was providing directions to a guest.
Sometimes desk people can have an attitude, but not this woman.
A sincere smile and a really good attitude.
I am usually tough in my reviews, but honestly, I can't find one fault with this place.
Traveled to Toronto for weekend Jay's game and visit the Hockey Hall of Fame.
This was a saturday night - I do not know if it is the same any other night of the week, but I would definitely ask to stay on the north side of the hotel and up higher if I ever travelled there again.
Some reviewers had mentioned the noise from the clubs so we asked for a quiet room and were not disappointed.
Did not hear a thing the whole time we were there.
I found it very quiet, although I did note a club directly next door with a patio, I could see the noise being a problem in the summer with nightlife in full swing.
All in all, a nice stay.
yes without hesitation.
Thought we were safe so high up, but it was still noisy.
First stay at Toronto with hubby.
Going to go back there again when coming back to toronto!
Night club outside was busy, but we heard nothing from our room.
And Hockey Hall of Fame.
THANKYOU!
The music started at about 11:00 and was pounding loud until 2:30 am.
All in all, a nice place, but I would only stay there if they could assure me that I would not be on that side of the building!
Our check in experience was not great.
Another issue I had is that we always ask for a room on an upper floor, this is the only Hilton on our entire trip that did not honor our request.
It was a very noisy Saturday night as there was lots of partying going on in the streets till 3 or 4 in the morning and we could hear it loud and clear.
I would not stay her again because of the rude front desk staff and the street noise.
What a wonderful overnight stay as we prepared to go to Sick Kids the next day.
Can't complain.
The surrounding areas were a little loud at night as it's in the middle of a bar district - however it didn't really bother us in the room.
Didn't end up using it.
How about a sign that states this at the front desk so we don't waste our time changing and taking off all of our makeup!
We tried to exchange our American money and the hotel tried to charge us a rate that would give us LESS money back even though the American dollar was worth about $1.20 that day.
Did we need to leave?
There was no announcement until 5 minutes after the alarm stopped!
Everything was brand new and of great quality.
Although Friday and Saturday Night was a bit noisy compared to Thursday night it was tolerable.
From the check in we were given a hard time because I wanted to pay for all the rooms under 1 card.
Then we asked 1 special favor.
Too many options in Toronto to waste your money here.
You donâ€™t need a car to get the most of the city; I rather recommend you walk as much as you can, you would not regret it.
There are literally hundreds of other options nearby.
This is where the weekend turns for the worse....
When we called they said it would be 20 minutes.
Total wait time: 1 hour.
Ridiculous!
Also note that there is a very busy club right next door to the entrance of this hotel.
Caused a bit of noise and just a lot of people right outside the hotel entrance.
(didn't bother us much as we are young and used to club crowds, but may not be best for families.)
Check in was very quick and easy.
Top tip!!!
Put it on the room account.
It took nearly half hour to get change!
Bizarre!
Took three attempts to get my change right and even then they got it wrong!
They have great rates, and works good for all purposes.
Only con during the stay was that the hotel didn't provide cellphone chargers, since I had lost my converter and had to buy another one.
I think we got one of the best value in Toronto.
The room-rate of this hotel was much less expensive than others and we had a perfect stay.
So, on Saturday nights at least, you're not going to get a lot of sleep.
Just returned from a 2-night stay at this hotel for a little getaway with the husband and kids.
Would stay here again!
I was with my wife in Toronto, September 2010.
This was my 1st time in Toronto so maybe there are better locations but I felt everyday we were there we walked in a different direction and found great things to do.
Weather you want a night club, pub, strip club, rock bar, resturant, or shopping ... it was all minutes from the door step.
What else can you ask for?.....
: )
There was a microwave and a mini fridge which was very convenient.
We requested a later check out and they would not accommodate this....which I have never had happen before.
Club district for clubbers out there.
The Saturday night rave at the local night spot was fairly noisy and interrupted our sleep.
Overall we had a fantastic 1 night stay especially since check out time was noon so we could sleep in.
I'd definitely return!
Overall the experience was positive and I would stay there again.
So glad I did!
My mom and I had a fabulous stay there...Essentially, we needed a nice place with a pool and hot tub, quiet clean rooms, at an affordable rate... We had all of that and so much more...
A trip to Toronto just isn`t complete without a ride on the Street Car, and a trip on the Subway to Eaton Centre!
Even the china town is just 5 mins by walk and you can find many bus services from there to take you to Niagara falls.
We took one of those hop on and off tour bus and there was a stop not that far from the hotel.. We only stayed there for 1 night but we made the most out of it.
I am glad w/ Hilton Garden Inn's TV's.
It's not like those old tv's from Marriott.
I was a bit concerned about what this would mean as we were staying over on a Saturday night.
!
My friends and I always book the Hilton when we have a big night out downtown for its convenience and great rooms.
That was a bit of a pain, but understandable, because it was getting extremely rowdy and it was clear people were bringing in about 10 people into one room.
This night was a bit of a mess; we would walk out to the hallway and smell weed, hear loud music blasting, etc.
If you want to check in early (it's usually 3pm), call in advance and many times they have some rooms that are ready, and they'll let you in with no extra charge.
I will be back.
In short - nothing really to complain.
Stayed there for 6 nights.
However, when we asked about our American money they told us at the front desk that the rate difference between American and Canadian was only "a few cents" and that they only exchange one for one.
So, rather than go look for a bank we went ahead and exchanged out money and gave them 40 dollars American and they gave us 40 dollars Canadian.
Not until the next day after we checked out did we find out that the rate was THIRTY FIVE cents difference on each dollar and when you do the math they make a very nice profit off of unsuspecting American tourists.
REASON FOR MY STAY: Birthday CHECK IN: Smooth and fast.
The condition of the shared areas and room were very clean and neat.
Stayed last night and was very happy.
(War Horse).
Conveniently, we slept through their return, so I guess it's well noise-insulated.
Food great and the views spectacular especially at night and they have computers for easy access to the web and e-mail up there.
Will definitely stay here again.
Spent all Sunday morning making phone calls to figure situation out.
Had to spend much time fixing their error.
Key cards kept deactivating so we had to go up and down elevator several times to have it reactivated.
Also offered professional driver to get car back.
We did not feel comfortable putting matters in their hands.
Rob Roy, Manager of hotel said he would call early last week to compensate.
Have placed several calls to him.
He has not called back.
The Intercontinental offered the same rate at this hotel.
If you're there on a weekend there's a club/restaurant with music directly downstairs on the south side of the hotel.
We were on the fourteenth floor and though we couldn't hear the music (which lasted until around 4 A.M.) the beat of the base permeated through the walls and just couldn't be stopped.
I stayed with a colleague for several nights during an academic conference at the convention centre.
Eventually they were able to fax that statement ... to my roommate, though I'd asked for one of my own.
My daughter and I visited Toronto Oct 8-11.
I compared rates here and given the location, this is a good value.
Shop for deals on the rate.
On the Thursday night of my stay a open air club cranked music till 3:00am.
Thankfully it's deep bass, so ear plugs do little good.
Just a heads up of you are staying there in the summer.
Andy
The whole experience was great, from the service to the choice and quality of the food.
: )
I had clicked "pay" for this non refundable rate when I realized that there were hidden charges for an additional $100.00.
There was a charge for an additional guest, the fare was for just one person!!
She spoke so fast all I understood is that most everything is located on the second floor.
All around, we had a good stay, but at US$ 200.00 a night, I could have picked something else.
We stayed here as part of a tour group.
Would definately recommend to anyone
We would stay again for sure.
Overall, a great stay and I would definitely stay there again, especially in the summer when there are tons of nearby patios to explote.
We prepaid for our room which was supposed to be 2 Queens, when we checked in we were told that they only had a King with sofabed left.
So obviously because we checked in late they gave our room away.
thank you abbas .
Only a 5 minute walk to the Rogers Centre where we watched the Blue Jays.
We have stayed there twice now in the past two years and will definitely consider staying again on our next trip.
We had no complaints.
Clean as can be, great beds, patient staff everywhere, fast elevators, great food.
Downfall ?
The obnoxious discobar downstairs next door !
WOW !
From the 17th floor we could be awakened from the thump thump of the disco music at 3am on a Saturday night !
OK, I love music, but this was no music !
Just bass thump !
But not on a Friday or Saturday night !
I did note that on one side of the hotel you can hear a slight "thump thump thump" from the night club next door.
Not enough to bother me, but if your a light sleeper may want to stay on the other side of the hotel.
