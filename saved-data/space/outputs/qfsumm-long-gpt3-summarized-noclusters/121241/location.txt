The location of the hotel was conveniently off the strip for quick routes to the main things we wanted to do in Branson.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
the only thing they could use there is a restaurant would make it alot better.
On arrival, Alissa checked us in and gave a detailed briefing on the facilities.
Location just off Green Mountain Drive tends to be quite...good.
As i stated it was very warm in there, i am not sure how they would expect anyone to stay in there without even a soda or water to drink.
We stayed here recently and really liked the location.
It was central to Branson's activities.
The hotel wasn't busy, so finding a good parking spot was easy.
We were celebrating our 22nd anniversary.
Thankfully I have a terrific family who handled these mistakes with grace and understanding.
The hotel is vast with lots of rooms.
This place is perfect for the family as the rates are favorable (especially if you have a Entertainment Card).
The hotel is located just off the main road going through the Branson attractions but was joined by many other hotels on the same road.
As I mentioned, I stayed there because of a function there.
Branson is a nice town, nice folks, temp not bad for summer time, and family friendly.
We drove from the Kansas City airport, which was almost 4 hours.
I would recommend flying into Springfield instead.
But overall its a nice town and I had a nice stay at the hotel
On the last day, three of the five daughters of the Warnock family came in and sang a song and gave out discount coupons for their show located at the Branson Mall.
A very talented family.
Too many nicer places to stay in Branson for the same price.
Nice view and great prices.
They even have an arcade onsite!
Oh and the Dockers Restaurant is next door and it's excellent, too!
We met our children and grandchildren at the Hotel for Memorial day weekend.
I recently took a quick weekend getaway to Branson with my mom and little girl.
Our vacation was from October 22 -26 and I made our reservation by calling them a week in advance to reserve rooms for my wife and I and my parents.
Upon arrival the girl at the front desk (Joy) said it only showed one of the two rooms reserved for us.
What is the point of vacationing together if you're in completely different buildings?
I highly recommend the Cascade.
Parking was a little crouded but they were very busy.
The man that took the reservation was very helpful.
Like the "off the Strip" location.
The location is great, its off the Yellow Route and accessible to anywhere in town.
All in all, it was a nice trip.
This place isn't fancy.
Its very much a budget based place without many frills.
The entire place looked dark, dingy and medieval so they're keeping with the whole castle theme, very dungeon-like.
It has a great location.
It is not far off of highway 76.
It is very close to the outlet malls, Branson Landing, White Water, and not too far from Silver Dollar City.
It is conviently located close to Walmart and many stores that we commonly shop.
I had the distinction of going through Veronica at Branson Tourism and she was pleasant and concerned with my booking a room.
It was hot and humid.
The ice machines broke down and the third floor did not have and ice machine.
The location is great, distant enough to be quiet and close enough to enjoy all the activities offered in Branson.
When away from home, the most important thing for us is having a comfortable bed to sleep in and to have the comforts of home.
The view was nice and once again we were extremely pleased wth our stay there!!
We loved the Stone Castle.
There is a convenient onsight restaurant.
This was by far the worst place I have ever attempted to stay!
I called and ensured our reservation and the lady told me it was confirmed!
At 11pm I contacted the Holiday Inn Express on Green Mountian Drive and Josh gave me a great rate to help compensate the poor quality of the Stone Castle.
Location is perfect: off the busy 76 highway, but handy via backroads to all the shows and restaurants.
and small.
The rooms are nice and the location is close enough to access everything we want to do in Branson, but off the strip so we can get to it quickly.
So we called, booked our room, and the next day hit the road to Branson.
My husband was on a working vacation and needed constant contact with the office back home as he was in the middle of a business transaction.
My family thoroughly enjoyed their stay.
We stayed here recently and really liked the location.
It was central to Branson's activities.
The hotel is centrally located in Branson.
It is very easy to access all the attractions and the strip.
But, most of all The Stone Castle is only minutes away from the best shows and attractions with plenty of parking.
Family had an enjoyable time.
The location was just off the strip, which we liked.
VERY important!
Some of the places are a whole lot better than others and the Settle Inn is the best of all.
We did not enjoy this vacation at all, and it was a total waste of time and money to stay here.
The hotel reservation desk was OK when we check in but when we checked out it was a different story.
So who knows where it is.
Her supervisor was sitting in the next room, saw and hear everything, and never came to the counter to see what was going on.
great location.
Booked on the phone and received very courteous assistance.
Stone Castle is conveniently located on the yellow route for easy accessibility to Branson as well as Silver Dollar City.
The hotel is located just off the road on the yellow route so we did not have any traffic noise.
There was plenty of well-lit parking even with a conference going on in the hotel.
We were close to lots of mini golf and restaurants.
It was a very dissapointing place to stay ~ NEVER again
Great location, accessable but not too much traffic.
Coming back in a week and bringing family.
