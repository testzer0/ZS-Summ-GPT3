***** Model produced summary *****
The guests who left reviews seemed to enjoy their stay at the hotel. They especially liked the pool and the breakfast buffet. They also appreciated the cleanliness of the rooms and the comfortable beds.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
Their favorite part was the breakfast show, the entertainer included them at intermission and they went home and told everyone they were IN the show!
I made reservations a few days before with Amber.
She was very pleasant and we talked about some of the negative remarks that have been made.
In addition there were 2 make-your-own waffle machines.
Between shows, we enjoyed an indoor pool and the hot tub.
The entire complex is non-smoking, which is a real plus for us…..Bottom Line….would we go back…You Bet!
.
One thing we like to do is check in and hit the pool.
We are in our fifties so we sure don't act out of line.
Great !
So we get changed grab a few beers and head back.
My husband inquired at the desk if they were firm on these rules.
It was great!
On the downside, the rooms & common areas were quite outdated and in need of some repair.
we were locked in this property because of the package we bought through the tracel company.
Check is was smooth, no problems at all.
I noticed that there weren't any extra outlets, we had to unplug the clock so I could plug in my laptop.
The problems we saw were - hotel is older and needs help.
The AC did not work well and kept the room just tolerably cool.
In fact, it had a hole where some kind of lock used to be.
The cable tv was horrible.
We got bad reception and approx 15 channels - most of which were news or informational.
Maybe not important to others, but I look forward to literature like the Branson travel guide that is available in most hotel rooms.
The other hotel was less expensive and much better.
all these things are assets......
Without hesitation we jumped on the opportunity.
It was wonderful!
We highly recommend this hotel.
It was spring break.
Will stay here again when we return.
We can find absolutely no reason to change, so you all are just stuck with us!
Thanks to everyone who is involved in making us all feel right at home.
See you in the Fall, 2012!

We slept well with absolutely no sound from the outside.
Check in and check out were fast and easy.
MOST OF WEEK CABLE & PHONES WERE DOWN, except for inhouse calling.
Stay for convention...place was filthy....nothing was clean.
We stayed there the weekend of the summer cruise.
Will stay there again.
It woke us up.
Flat screen TV with lots of channels, but no fridge or microwave.
For the great deal we got on this place, we were well pleased.
My son enjoyed the indoor pool and game room.
I recommend it, just don't expect luxury - expect average and clean.
We had our family reunion at this hotel.
My travel agent had prepared "packets" for each family with the itinerary and what there was do in Branson.
I could not more unhappy about this experience and will never go there again.
Branson itself is a pretty cool place, lots to do for music fans, outdoor fans, etc.
We had an hour long ride for $25 you can't beat that.
We will go back again we did have alot of fun.
The TV was an old picture tube TV...which i don't see much of any more.
If I was going to Branson for any other reason I would probably stay at a more up to date chain hotel.
Its about a 1 hour drive from there.
We will definetly return!
The music was provided by Cowboy Tucker and Mr. Yeary.
Mr. Yeary approached me and we talked about my youngest son who was sitting with me at breakfast.
Love Branson.
Look forward to staying there again!!
!
Run away from this place as fast as you can.
The entire hotel smells old and musty.
UGH!
The breakfast was very bland and the music show wasn't that great either.
Rates were very affordable.
The check in was fast.
I called the front desk, they said they would have the IT person reset the router.
I waited, waited, waited.
Still nothing.
But it didn't.
The tv was older, did not have many channels at all, mainly a news channel, tbs, a few others, No HBO or premium channels.
Esp if you have the Entertainment Book www.entertainment.com.
You get HALF off if you have the card from the book.
Go on down the road.
Are rooms were close together, very family friendly Hotel.The beds were very comfortable.
The breakfast experience was GREAT, the live music show was fun and entertaining.
All in all a wonderful experience.
I recommend this hotel do some serious updates!!
!
would have left after the first nite but would have had to pay the second night anyway.
the sink was in the ;main room which wasn't very well designed.
My wife and I were booked into the Settle Inn though a time share promotion company.
The TV in the armoire was 19”.
However, it too had a dirty feel to it.
I’m not sure what the regular rate is for the Settle Inn, but I hope it is very low.
I'd give it 5 out of 5 stars in its price range.
!
Nice stay!
The theme was very cute with knite statues.
Best value in Branson.
Would recommend and would stay again.
I was very leery staying at this hotel after all reviewing a lot of negative reviews.
However, a last minute decision to go to Branson brought us here.
Yes, the reviews were accurate on the interior.
Yes, the TV in our room was about the size of my iPad.
No worries, though - we didn't go to watch the TV.
We were traveling with an infant (yes, we're those people) and they were more than happy to accomodate our special requests at our late check in.
We would likely stay again for another quick trip.
The sink is very narrow.
A large armoire had a very small tv.
2 people in my group had door locks that would not work properly on their rooms.
Look elsewhere!
!
wonderful in door pool and hot tub/spa.
The water is hot, the sheets are good enough - but don't expect the Ritz.
I found it very comfortable and relaxing.
The atmosphere was nice and friendly.
It was rather quiet too considering there was several groups staying there the same weekend that our church stayed.
On day 2, we found a bug in bed, checked out.
We were refunded 2 nights of our stay.
What?!
I would never stay there again and, in fact, would tell others to steer clear.
It was really comfortable!!
It should be condemned.
I love staying at The Stone Castle when I am in Branson.
When it was time to go the kids begged to stay longer.
I have read the negative reviews and frankly am quite surprised by them.
For a couple, this was a truly magical experience and I could not wait to get back to my room each night.
Nothing to write home about.
It was certainly worth free.
I would not return unless it was at no cost.
I would recommend this to every one.
When we checked out a real manager was on duty and did adjust the room rate to match what the confirmation showed.
That's about it.
The conference room was adequate but sultry and hot.
We get all that at the Settle Inn.
We just got back from a 5 day stay in Branson.
We used an American Express and were told our card was declined, not a good feeling when starting a vacation.
Very small TV.
When we checked out, I left my purse in the drawer of the entertainment center and didn't realize until I'd gotten somewhere that I needed a credit card.
I called the hotel and the maid had, already, cleaned the room and brought the purse to the front desk.
Everyone said how much they liked the assortment.
And, the rate was awesome.
:)
The medieval theme brings a sense of adventure like being in a castle overlooking the lights of Branson.
Wonderful place!
I will be back.
Nice TV; free WiFi.
We would certainly stay here again when visiting Branson.
Upon booking this hotel with ReserveBranson.com I checked tripadvisor and most reviews said good things.!
or they didnt check the sheets and blankets!
There were some bad reviews too.
I have pictures on my phone and will post after I transferr them to my computer.
We were only there for like three hours.
I had to take my wife, 6 week old daughter, and my 8 year old daughter out at 11 pm to take them to a clean place for them to sleep!
I will comment again when they refund my money for the stained castle Inn.....I mean Stone Castle Inn.
Would definitely go back.
Our experience was just "okay".
Will definitely stay here again.
Great Great GREAT!!!!
The first time the hot tub was a little dirty and the breakfast not so great.
Still a nice stay though.
I have a 3 year old daughter who doesn't want to stay any other place than "Shrek's Castle" She thinks the Knight on the horse on the far end looks like Shrek.
:) We will be coming back again!
I took my parents with me the last time and they will now be staying here when they go back.
We will stay with them on our next visit.
We were wanting a relaxing romantic getaway and they were awesome!
We really enjoyed our stay again in Branson.
Are tv was not working when we checked in but they changed it as we called which was at 11pm.
Hot tub was hot first night but cold second night.
Would proabely stay again.
We would stay there again.
The TV's need to be replaced/upgraded and the channel selection was not great.
Very comfortable.
The TV was a bit small for my husband but fine for me.
My family and I have been to Branson many times, on the average twice a year for the last 30 years.
Needless to say, we have stayed at almost every hotel/motel in Branson.
This truly is our favorite place to stay in Branson for both the parents and the kids.
This truly is our favorite place to stay in Branson for both the parents and the kids.
Needless to say, we left after 2 nights and came home.
There are others around the area that hopefully are cleaner and respect their guests.
We had a message on our phone saying we had a package at the desk.
I left a note to be sent to Branson Vacationland that we needed to turn in before we left showing we had taken advantage of the presentation we were assigned (tried to leave it with them directly but they were closed as we left early a.m) so the checkout person said,reluectantly, that they could send it when they sent their next billing to BV.
I asked that she run a copy for me, sign and date it so I had something to followup with in the event they did not do it.
Turned out we were very plesently surprised at what we received.
very nice.
love them.
the kids love staying there.
want to thank them all.
we stay there all the time.

You can hear water running and people next door talking.
We were part of a three day conference for about 40 couples.
I would highly recommend it!
The TV's could be bigger but overall a great value.
There were several ball teams staying here as well as a young women's conference.
We were not bothered by any outside noise from the hallway as the kids and adults made their way to the pool.
!
We did not make reservations due to the fact we are always looking for great deals and try to stay at townhouses or cabins.
We are so glad we did!
Our boys got to sleep by themselves!
2) Charged my card three times-Took 10 days to clear up.
They offer a good discount for Silver Dollar City season ticket holders.
From check in to check out, everything was great.
My husband and I were very pleased and will be back.
My husband and I were very pleased and will be back.
It is a good value for the money.
It did make it hard to read of an evening though.
We stayed her for 4 nights over the Thanksgiving Holiday and very pretty uncomfortable the entire time.
We've been here before in a jacuzzi room, which was very nice, and we enjoyed our stay this time just as much as the last.
Quiet and clean!
No probs like other reviewer.
and used the coupons.
