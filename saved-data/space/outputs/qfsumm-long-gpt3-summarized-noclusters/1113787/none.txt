***** Model produced summary *****
The reviews were generally positive, highlighting the hotel's proximity to the airport, spacious rooms, and 42" flat screen TV. The pool was noted as being crowded and loud, but this was apparently due to non-hotel guests. Complimentary bottled water and toiletries were much appreciated.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
There was a nice collection of magazines in a rack next to the toilet bowl!
Just one downside.
We immediately left.
When I booked the suite, I advised the hotel that this would be for my wedding.
The big white dress later that night was a dead giveaway.
Nothing more, nothing less.
The impeccable treatment such as thoughtful notes, champagne, or other niceties were no where to be found.
It really ruined the experience for me.
The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.

Don't let the historic/old look of this hotels exterior fool you.
Very intimate.
Would certainly recommend any one stay here.
It needs to be removed ASAP.
I took it with astonishment.. if ice is all the guests want from this hotel it says it all about the culture this hotel is trying to achieve.
No refund on items we complained about.
I came to The Joule with a friend for my 21st birthday and had an incredible stay.
The minor negatives are half hearted negatives.
Back to the good things.
EVERYONE I met there was extraordinarily nice to me.
- Mr. Ray
My boyfriend and I stayed there for his birthday and I wanted everything to be perfect.
Jessica, the front desk manager, was great.
We had opportunity to go to PM that night as well.
We got the red carpet treatment.
They had initially reserved us a table but when we got there it had been given away.
I would say that this place is worth a chance despite the reviews.
We had a lovely, relaxing weekend.
When I checked out they double billed for the room (once in my name and once in my wife's) and the guy at desk said they had had problems with that happening.
We ordered take out from Charlie Palmer and they even provided us plates and silverware.
This was a great suprise and much appreciated.
(I felt a little like I was on a cruise ship.)
Everything was great.
I agree with one reviewer that the outside club noise was a bit excessive, but that's the price for the great locale!
Needless to say, I felt very out of place in my suit w/my husband's shirt as a cover-up (I forgot mine) so we turned tail and left.
Still, overall we had a wonderful experience.
On this occasion however, I went for pleasure.
We were greeted at the curb by 3 very friendly bell staff.
Upon our return our suite was adorned with rose petals, chilled champagne and a basket of fruit.
Loved.
the.
The only down-side for us (because we're not as young as we used to be) was the night life (we were there on a Friday night) on the street kicks in at about midnight and continues with great enthusiasm until about 4am.
YES!
I had a fantastic experience staying at the Joule.
I took my boyfriend their for a staycation for his birthday.
I truly appreciated how thorough they were in handling my requests and following up with me to ensure that I knew everything was taken care of.
This hotel receives my strongest recommendation!
Craig is a knowledge person of the area and helped so much with all of our questions.
Which in Dallas going without a car for a weekend is a rarity.
!
We have set up many group stays with The Joule and have always been very satisfied!
Our contact, Jessica Craycraft, is very professional and is always eager to assist with our requests.
I would defintely recommend The Joule for group stays!
Dark and moody still.
Dark and moody still.
Overall, the hotel is good value for money, in the higher end range.
Had a very nice stay at this property!
Thank you Ms. Gray!

Thanks for a great weekend- hope to be back soon!
We found that to be true.
I cant say enough about The Joule.
They were excellent.
In closing, we will be back.
I travel with my job as well as work with high net clientele, which sometimes can be challenging to say the least.
I was at the Joule for pleasure this time Bryce was my driver a couple of times, he carried on a conversation as if he had known me forever.
!
the stay was a breeze.
would love to go back i a heartbeat.
Would definitely recommend the hotel.
I was so livid with how it was being handled that I was ready to completely lose it.
we are local but made a "staycation" out of my birthday celebration for a night.
the romance package is worth the upgrade because it includes champagne, valet parking, chocolates and breakfast, and they even cover the bed with rose petals if/when you leave the room after check-in.
if i had to nit pick i would say that a couple of lights switches and one of the phones did not work (ironic for a restored electric building) but in all honesty none of those defects affected our stay, which is probably why no one bothered to report them before; having said that a hotel of this stature should probably have better quality control so i still deducted one star from my rating.
The detail in any of the rooms you stay in are just amazing.
For my wife's birthday, I made reservations at The Joule.
The manager, Levi and Myron at the front desk went out of their way to help us with needs during our stay.
My wife enjoyed the entire weekend.
I would definitely stay at The Joule again.
I would not suggest bringing kids here although there were no problems we were the only family we saw.
Jessica and Byron were able to help organize my large group of 21 guests with ease.

I am very happy with my stay.
Thank you so much!

From the time we drove up to the Valet at the hotel and were greeted by the amazing staff until we left the hotel the experience was one that I will never forget.
Sincerely, Shana Uptown in Dallas
Spend your $$$ at the W!!!
!
There are probably more remote controls in these rooms than in any other hotel you have stayed in.
The first time I stayed here, I arrived late and figuring out all the controls was maddening.
It is elegant and comfortable.
I would recommed it to anyone that wants an elegant European hotel in the states.
On 3/27/11, we checked into The Joule in Dallas, TX.
The comfort level of our room also allowed us to rest peacefully without any interrupting noise, enjoy a good nightâ€™s sleep, and relax while watching TV.
Overall, our stay at The Joule was a complete delight.
It is definitely worth checking out while in Dallas.
I would never hesitate to return to this hotel.
I hope to be back.
!
That evening we went down to the club PM which is in hotel very unfriendly and it took us for ever to get in and if your staying at hotel it is suppose to not be a problem to get in YEAH RIGHT!!!!
I would also like to acknowledge a gentlemen named Trey Shultz, I believe was his name, he played a very instrumental part of my enjoyable stay.
Overall was very pleased, and would definitely refer friends and family to your hotel in the future.
Thank you Joule!
My only regret is that i wasn't here on a weekend to experience the nightclub downstairs or in the summer to hangout by the roof top pool all day and drink cocktails!!
So, the rate was great and the stay was absolutely Excellent!!!
I can go on and on but if you have any options going to Dallas then the choice is easy.

Our stay at the Joule was second to none and on par with the best hotels in the world.
Craig that helped bring my one bags and all of my wife bags up was so helpful, especially with help explain the lights in the room, couldn't the hotel have less complicated lighting arrangements?.
If anything other hotels that are being built should use the joule as a starting point.
I immediately called the hotel and reported the error.
The next morning I received a call from the accounting department and received the proper credit.
The accounting department once again checked into this and called me right back and was able to credit me for this charge as well.
I will definitely stay there again.
Very noisy from this area until 2am.
They did refund our $27 valet parking fee.
We enjoyed our stay!
(We are VERY picky.)
Very Romantic....GO!!!
You will not be disappointed.
My husband & I stayed a night for his birthday.
We had fun and it was great to go to a club and not have to drive home.
We stayed at The Joule and had a fantastic time.
.
We will definitely be back!
You won't be sorry.
Our stay at The Joule began early afternoon on September 3rd.
My guests were so intrigued by the history and architecture.
Great idea.
It was so nice!!!
In a New York minute.
From the moment of check-in to check-out, our experience was first class.
No problem.
We recommend both.
Thank you.
I live in the north DFW area, and it is my job to become very famiilar with many hotels and their services around the Metro-plex.
The Joule was a refreshing experience and definitely a cut above the rest.
Craig respected my need for adhearance to a timely schedule during my check out and made it a seamless transaction.
Thank you for renewing my faith in the hotel industry!
I needed a late night pressing of my suit.
Done, with no hassle.
I would have nothing bad to say if I had not realized when I got home that the valet (or somebody with access to our car in the valet lot), had stolen a couple of items from my trunk.
I'll certainly be back.
!
Maverick was a wonderful host!
Can NOT wait to return!
Whoever is the GM is doing an amazing job with their staff!
Our stay ended up being way more than great.
Not great if you're trying to sleep in.
Being it is very contemporary, be prepared for glass shower and toilet doors.
When we returned, we waited in line to enter the PM Lounge, a club on the bottom floor of the Joule.
The birthday girl waited for another 45 mins to speak to the hotel manager about the situation, but he was preoccupied trying to iron out a situation for some honeymooners who had made reservations that the hotel couldn't locate.
After such a long and sweltering wait, the b-day girl's guests began to just leave out of frustration.
If you want a private cabana by the pool, be sure to reserve it in advance.
Being a little jaded from regularly staying at the Four Seasons and the Ritz Carlton we have high expectations, all of which were delightfully exceeded!
I have stayed in hotels all over world and this was one of the worst experiences, and that is rating this hotel against much cheaper ones.
We only stayed one night and had so many issues.
Wait it gets better!
They finally corrected that charge, but now 2 days later they have charged a separate additional charge of $121!
So I called AGAIN to ask why, they said it was for mini bar.
We went out for dinner and then straight to sleep, then left early in morning bc construction noise woke us up, so we didn't have time to eat anything from mini bar.
Save yourself the trouble and stay elsewhere.
I'm spending more time sorting out issues than the time we spent in the room.
!
the balcony was so cute, had a little picnic table with a great view of the city.
ah if only we had more time.
it looked closed but we pushed the ticket and open sesame!
jackpot.
Lot's of extras that make this hotel THE HOTEL!
I get the feeling that this is just the way it's done at the Joule for every guest.
Upon check in our room was not ready, but they offered to hold our luggage and let us swim in their pool.
We traveled to Dallas for a Birthday Party at the Joule and decided to stay out of convenience.
It was priced a bit high but after our experience, we would definitely stay again!
Later in the evening we went up to the Penthouse for the birthday party and were greeted by Virginia with the head of security, I could have talked to her all night!
All in all it was a great experience!
Highly recommended!
How nice is that feature?
No need to lean across the bed to turn off a nightstand light, just push the fixture back into the headboard!
Either way, she maybe knowledgable about the city so just be warned about her delivery when talking to her.
That tidbit of knowledge gave me a connection which I appreciated.
