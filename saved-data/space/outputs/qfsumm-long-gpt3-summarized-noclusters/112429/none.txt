***** Model produced summary *****
The guests who left reviews seemed to enjoy their stay at the hotel. Compliments were given for the cleanliness of the hotel, the attention to detail, the comfortable furniture, the robes, the great shower, and the excellent king bed. The only complaints were in regards to the restaurant, which some guests felt was not up to par. However, the location of the hotel was praised for being central to many downtown stores and attractions.

He is nice and was very helpful.
Ask for Jerry he will take care of you.

I would absolutely return next time I'm in Seattle.
I just returned from a three night stay at the paramount.

I had difficulty securing a reservation at the major chain hotels in downtown Seattle, so I made a reservation at the Paramount (which is part of a small chain, called Coast hotels, of mostly West coast properties).

I certainly didn't expect that!
:)
Very comfortable.

My wife, one year-old son and I stayed at the Paramount for two nights over a weekend to attend a family wedding at the Hyatt across the street.
Things started to go terribly wrong on our second night.
The manager knocked off $50 for that incident.
Meanwhile our son was tearing up the lobby.
Even though rates are half that of the Hyatt, maybe go to a better hotel with better service.
Later the manager offered me a night in one of their associated hotels; another wild goose chase with unreturned calls and false promises.
I did not enjoy my stay here.
Based on my overall experience I could not recommend this hotel.
i would definitely stay here again.
In that regard, this hotel delivers superior value.
Highly recommended (still)!

I couldn't get the Grand Hyatt across the street to guarantee a room with two beds for the weekend I wanted earlier this month, so I picked the Paramount instead.
Barnes and Noble right on the corner.

You'll be glad you did.
I have stayed at the Paramount several times, and plan on staying there with every visit to Seattle.
and the value is outstanding.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the air-conditioning worked great.
However, it is a smaller hotel, so I fully understand why it might not be practical to have ice-makers on every floor.
Great views from the room.
Basically I agree with all the positive statements submitted by others.
A girlfriend and I spent 3 nights here and felt it was perfect for us.
