Aspect: location
***** Model produced summary *****
The hotel is located across the street from the airport, within walking distance to a Denny's, Jack in the Box, and a steak place. Downtown Seattle was about a 30 minute ride by light rail service (cost of $16 for the 4 of us) or $40 cab ride to the pier. It had easy access to the light rail located at the airport (we took the DT shuttle over).
***** Golden Review 1 *****
It's a convenient location close to the airport, with shuttle service to and from the airport that runs every 15 minutes for 24 hours a day. The shuttle service is very good. It's so close you could even walk to the airport if you wanted. It's also in convenient walking distance of many restaurants.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The airport was convenient to reach with the help of a speedy, twenty-four hour shuttle bus. Also located nearby, within walking distance, was a Denny's, a fast food joint, and a steak house.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
Within walking distance from the airport, this hotel's location is great. There is even a 24 hour shuttle that runs every 15 min that will take you to the airport or some near by places to eat like Denny's Jack in the Box and a steak place.

What they didn't tell us when booking on the website is that the parking is $16 per night and the internet in the rooms is not wireless.
We stayed in the village part of the hotel, which were found to be old and dark.
The area around the airport can be iffy, as in many large metropolitan areas.
The hotel has a convenient airport shuttle that picks up guests on level 3 of the airport parking garage at stops #1 and 3.
Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed watching airplanes takeoff and land, and this hotel provides an eagle's eye view of the airport (unless you're on the east side of the tower, in which case you're stuck looking at the snowcapped Cascades and/or Mt Rainier).
At 1am the lobby bar was still very active with a jovial but well-behaved crowd, although the bartenders were understandably ready to head home to their families.
We were told we had a great view of the "lake" from our room.
There was no lake visible.
It looks nice on the outside,, but inside it is very shabby and used.
This hotel was within a stone's throw of Sea-Tac airport and right next to the off-site Thrifty car rental lot, so for location, it was great.
The hotel restaurant was nice enough, but again, bland; the food was nicely presented but had no taste.
I had to trek all the way to the front-desk from out tower location (to have key re-coded) only to f ind it did not resolve issue.
Saw shuttle pass us along the way ;-( Still, LIKE the location and the cookies ;-)
Across from Sea Tac Airport.
The shuttle will drop you at the airport train station if you are going to Seattle, but on your way back you must walk from the station to the shuttle bus pick up area at the airport(about a 5 to 10 minute walk).
Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
You are charged for parking - $8/night for outdoor parking.
Parking is another point of contention but I did not park so not really going worry about this one.
The DoubleTree was convenient to the airport, even though we were part of group travel, the DoubleTree had an airport shuttle.
There were elevators, gift shop, restaurant and lots of other dining choices just across the street.
Stayed at this property for one night with my family ( wife and 4 and 7 yr old) before a morning flight.
Be sure to have your receipt for parking from the front desk (i did thanks to previous posts) or you won't be able to get your car.
All in all a good airport property.
Only one hiccup when we were collecting our car through their valet ,the valet asked pretty abruptly as we $5 tipped him if we had settled our parking fee.
Our travel agent booked the hotel through a cruise company as part of a package deal.
It was about fifteen minutes away from town and very close to the airport.

Very close to Seatac, we were tempted to walk there from the airport.
The neighborhood has mostly fast-food or 'greasy-spoon' joints except for a nice looking Thai restaurant across the street.
We had planned to eat at the hotel restaurant but it was not open.
Strange for such a large hotel not to have a restaurant or two.
If you are not using the airport shuttle this hotel is great.
We stayed near the airport at the beginning of our trip and stayed at the Cedarbrook Lodge as it was rated no 1 on Trip Advisor.
The only issue we had was the size of the hotel with various wings that were difficult to navigate.
Staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are decent, and it's very close to the airport.
The airport shuttle runs round the clock (every twenty minutes) and is very efficient.
The hotel's extended parking option provides great value.
This place is huge - felt like I was in Disneyworld!!
Unfortunately there was no wifi and the parking was $16 per night - expensive for the area.
We have stayed at this hotel several times in the family suite ( 2 bedrooms/1 king and 2 queen beds).
We get the stay and jet package so we park for a week for only $30.00.
It wasn't loud at all from the airport but was loud from the hallway (which didn't bother us since we left by 5 am).
They were extremely convenient to the airport.
:) The only complaint is - parking for overnight cost $16, and on top of that, we had $1.40 of tax!!!
I can see paying parking for a downtown hotel - but for a hotel at Sea-Tac it seemed absurd to have to pay parking.
My co-workers and I joke about the Doubletree Maze at SEATAC.
It takes a few trips to figure it out.
We ended up on the 11th floor overlooking the airport and the Cascades.
Shuttle to airport runs every 20 minutes.
We took the shuttle from the airport, and then back again to pick up our rental car (save the parking fee).
The view we had was of some large trees and some people's backyards- better than the parking lot for us (but I wouldn't want to live there!).
But it is fine for what it is- a quick, convenient, comfortable stay by the airport.
We did book directly on the Hilton chain website and got a rate of about $89.
The pool area, lobby and view from the balcony were very nice, not what I normally find when traveling and especially not this close to the airport!
Also nice view of some trees out the balcony.
We were tired and against Trip Advisor's advice we went to the restaurant at the hotel for a late night snack.
Great location within view or shuttle ride from the airport.
I reserved off Priceline and got a great rate.
Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
Just too too big for a one night stay, but a lovely hotel after all.
Confusing layout.
I sateyed here with husband and 1 year old son.
We stayed at this hotel as it was close to the airport for our early morning flight.
Shuttle to the airport every 20 mins 24 hours.
The restaurant also had good food (we were given a $10 per person coupon to use in the restaurant from the hotel).

It is an easy drive into downtown Seattle from here and worked great for my late-arriving flight before meetings in Seattle the following morning.

Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water.
Service is outstanding, there nightclub is always fun and classy.
I arrived late at night and was flustered by the confusing and poorly lit parking options.
At my prompting he suggested the self-park behind the hotel but it was almost as expensive as the valet!
The good news - the hotel is very close to the airport with a 24hr shuttle to the airport.
We parked our car there for a week, and were impressed with the service and rates compared with the airport.
We had dinner in the attached restaurant, and the food was absolutely delicious.
The only drawback was that the restaurant was a little on the pricey side for breakfast, but there are many places nearby to eat.
Airport pickup runs every 15 minutes.
On the downside, I just recently tried to make a reservation for another night with my husband, and they want to charge $10 for the second person.
This was right by the SeaTac Airport, whereby they had a shuttle that would come every 20 mins, and the valet would park the vehicle while we off traveling.
Use the map the front desk provide and you will have no issues.
The only downside is that the lady at the front desk gave us the weirdest directions to get to our hotel room.
It is on a busy street and I didn't see a restaurant within walking distance so I ate in the lobby.
Hotel is very close the the airport and room was comfortable.
Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax.
That's where I parked.
Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.
I understand charging when leaving the car consecutive days when not using the hotel, but there shouldn't be a charge at a suburban hotel for guests for one night.
We advised reception who promised immediate action.
We began loading our luggage ourselves and when no-one arrived I headed to reception to be greeted by one man with our new room key.
We were quite surprised as this was the only hotel during our two week Washington State vacation that did not provide a fantastic experience.
No airplane or traffic sounds.
We purchased the Park and Fly Package and were very happy to discover that this package included valet parking for our car directly out front of the hotel, not off in a back parking lot or at an off site location like many other hotels.
Self-parking is $19.
The hotel is conveniently located, just across the street from the airport entrance with a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes.
When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that.
Our room was connected to the main lobby by a skyway; we were in building 5 -- it wasn't very close.
The diner next door was good -- I think it's 'Dave's Diner'.
Stayed for one night before catching a flight out of Sea-tac Airport.
The restaurant was quite good considering it's not "downtown".
My only complaint about this hotel was the charge for parking.
I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car.
Free shuttle to the airport got us to the terminal in about 3 minutes!
If you are looking for a place to stay near the airport - this is a great one!
From the wings it was a bit of a hike to the restaurants and front desk.
Parking is expensive at $25 for valet and $21.50 for self-park per night.
Free shuttle to and from airport helps.
Good jumping off spot for wherever you want to go.
Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
--Rooms have a small deck, but the view is of the airport - nothing spectacular.
--Location is very convenient to the airport, and pretty quick access to I-5.
;) BAD: --YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PARK HERE.
This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking.
This place had a gigantic parking lot.
I think parking cost $12 or so.
--Common areas could be kept up better and cleaner.
If you are coming late and/or leaving early at Sea-Tac, this is not a bad choice.
I didn't rent a car, so didn't have the worries of paying a parking fee at the hotel.
Enjoyed they had computers available, and a printer so you can print out your boarding pass.
The restaurant and bar restaurant are better than average and again great staff.
The parking situation was a bit weird - we had a rental we needed to return and we were given 20 free minutes to unload and get the car out, but the rental return was next door, whcih was nice.
Close to the airport.
Surprisingly since this was close to the airport, we weren't woken up by any airplanes.
And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!
Our room was reserved well in advance, with no mention of a parking fee for their guests!
Shame on you Doubletree for charging your own guests to pay to park on your site during their stay.
It wasn't noisy at all as you might expect being so close to the runways.
Ate at on-site bar/restaurant which was good.
Staff asked family with small child to move to restaurant portion which was the right thing to do.
Yes it is a bit far from downtown, but very close to the airport.
