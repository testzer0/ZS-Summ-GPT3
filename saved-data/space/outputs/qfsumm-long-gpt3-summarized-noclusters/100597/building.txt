Aspect: building
***** Model produced summary *****
The building was clean, the beds were fine, the hotel is located across the street from the airport, within walking distance to a Denny's, Jack in the Box, and a steak place. The staff was great and friendly. The room was ready very early in the morning for us.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The historical hotel lobby were very attractive. The balcony had a great view of trees . The spa and heated pool is a kid-friendly area and also has wi-fi. There is even a laundry room available to the guests.

Hotel with very nice lobby and relaxing spa/pool area with lounge and free wifi. The pool is big and kid-friendly. There is also a beautiful view of the trees from the balcony.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
Warm, beautiful, large pool for the family. Old fashioned interior but pleasant rooms, great balcony, and the view outside to the trees was relaxing.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
Several fireplaces and seating areas in the lobby make it comfortable.
Access to the tower is by external glass elevators.
One wing building was closed for renovation.
I went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and I had what I needed - nice touch.
The tower elevators, which run on the exterior of the building, were quite cold.
As a Doubletree, I expected a GOOD three star property for my stay on August 27, 2004.
This is a large property with (I believe) five buildings.
The walk from that building to the lobby is about 2-3 minutes.
Overall this is a good property.
I was put into this property by an airline due to a maintenance issue, although I checked in late at night and had to leave early the next morning, I saw enough that I want to return!
When we arrived we were told by the front desk the roll-a-way would be sent up immediately and would probably be there before we got up to the room.
There is an abundance of gardens in between the different buildings and all were very well maintained and tended.
They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin.
The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms.
The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
The exterior of the buildings in these wings looks like some outdated Polynesian tiki architecture.
It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.
The gift shop was well stocked and very reasonably priced.
Will stay there again in the future.
This property is a mess.
Stayed in the high-rise portion.
Lobby has PC with printer to check in to airline and print boarding pass.
