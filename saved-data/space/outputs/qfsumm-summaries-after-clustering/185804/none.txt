A tiny problem, but big when you are in a hurry: offer better hair dryers than the low-powered one provided.
There actually isn't any; the bedside lamp is too dim to read by.
We hope to be back soon.
And the best part is- it's dog friendly!
My mutt loves Granville Island!
I’ve been here for nine days and I couldn’t be happier.
Granville Island is an oasis inside a city.
I bought my husband a "weekend getaway/theatre package" for Christmas, which included an executive suite at the Granville Island Hotel, dinner at the hotel, and tickets to a theatre production.
It was outstanding.
We didn't even turn on either of the two TV's while there - we just sat and looked out the window at the ever changing scenery.
Overall a great weekend experience, and we will definately be back.
I have stayed here on business, with Family and with friends and no one has ever been anything but totally impressed.
It's near enough to the city yet has a different feel - probably because the Island is a working place, not just a tourist trap.
It's also great to see the students at the Emily Carr Institute.
And Man!
Was that a great reason to stay here.
I don't care where you've been in your travels.
Hope this helps!
If you want to walk/cycle - it doesn't get better the the walking/cycling trails leading away from Granville Island.
My wife and I just concluded our 4 day stay at this hotel and loved every minute of it.
Granville Island is actually a little peninsula (more like a giant pier) with a very laid back feel to it, complete with a down-home fresh foods market, like something you would see in the movies.
Deserves a huge 5 stars.
Cannot wait to go back.
Most comfortable week I have spent anywhere.
It was all lovely, beautiful venue with the patio and city and water view, delicious food, all the guests and a great time!
What better place to be than Granville Island.
We are a 40-something couple travelling with 3 small children.
Unbelievable.
Our girls loved the decent-sized hot tube with the windowed ceiling that allowed us to watch the starts at night.
I travel a lot for business and I always look forward to staying at the Granville because I always get what I expect which is good value for the money and a very nice stay.
Will keep coming back without a doubt!
All in all a good stay.
We had chosen it based on the reviews on the Trip advisor web site.
I cannot understand it's high rating on this site.
This time I planned ahead and we had an amazing time both at the hotel and enjoying all that Granville Island has to offer!
You can walk to everything on granville island and there is a lot to see and do there.
If we return to the area I would definitely stay here again.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel if you wish to be in the Granville Island area.
Granville Island itself has restuarants of its own, a wonderful public market and quaint boutiques.
If we have to pick something we missed, and it's hard to do, we would have loved a hot tub on premises.
In 2004 my daughter was back East with her dad's family for Christmas and I just couldn't stomach the idea of spending another holiday with my then-significant other's nice but guarded family in an overheated home where conversation never goes deeper than discussion of recipes, jobs and weather.
I make my reservations in August, typically.
I arrive early in the day on Christmas Eve to be sure to have plenty of time for the market and other fun shops on the island before they close for the holiday.
It's such a wonderful experience!
It was amazing!
When the holiday routine takes it toll, take your break at the Granville.
I'll see you dockside.

The mini bar was stocked sufficiently with a wide variety of refreshments and snacks.
This also allowed us to research events and activities and various places to visit for the following day.
It was a pleasure to work with the team at the Granville Island Hotel to set up 2 days of catered meetings.
From reviewing the meeting room options to choosing menus and getting setup, the process was fast and smooth.
Both experiences were excellent.
Me and my family of 3 (Myself, Wife & Son) loved staying on Granville Island.
When we return to Vancouver we will be stating at the property again.
I stayed here for 5 days at an educational "intensive".
Granville Island itself is very interesting, although I didn't have enough time to really explore.
We're locals, but spend Christmas at the hotel each year, with our 3 (large) dogs and cat.
With the hectic run up to Christmas ( I usually end up having to work right up to about 3 on the 24th), the arrival at the hotel is usually accompanied by a deep sigh... we're home!
We recently had an extremely bad stay at an American Sheraton hotel, and were a bit gunshy about staying in ANY hotel again...haha.
Ach, beautiful!!
But that's our fault!
Thanks again!
My 11 year old daughter marvelled at the Toy Store, loved the food fudge vendors and even the buskers tunes.
I'd highly recommend this hotel.
The Big Bus hop onhop off goes fairly close to the hotel (5-7 min walk) Live Music played most nights from Restaurant which while very good when you have a full day and want to sleep it would go until about midnight.
Would recommend to any traveller
My two kids loved walking through the island each day to get back to the hotel.
Would definitely return!
Highly enjoyed our stay and the next time we have the money to go out for a nice weekend again, we will definitely be going back here :)
In no way was this a three star hotel.
We left that night for a better place.
It's those kinds of perks which make people decide to return.
Oh, my gosh.
The views of South Downtown are amazing (see pics).
We had an awesome experience.
The room had outstanding views.
My wife and I truly enjoyed our stay and we love the atmosphere of the public market.
I made a list while staying there Good Points * Great location and really only hotel in the kitsilano area and only one on GI * Comfortable bed * Lots of drawer space in bathroom * Good selection in mini bar ie.
We could hear chairs and people moving around in the adjoining room as if it was in our room mostly because of the echoing from the marble floors.
The room was in a very quiet section of the property but the noise factor was a problem because of the large space in the threshold of the door and the rooms on either side.
The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.
This is a great hotel and obviously a favorite with discerning locals having events...they weren't really an obstruction to our having a great time, but did become something of a joke as both the hotel and adjoining park/marina/galleries are dripping with wedding parties.
We travelled with 4 kids and still had a terrific, romantic weekend!
Keep-up the good work.

My wife and I had a bad experience at GIH.
I would not recommend this to my friends or family.
Think twice if you are going to plan an event there, or at least go in warned!

We love going to Granville Island, but never have enough time to explore all of the nooks and crannies of this interesting place.
It rained all four days that we were there in mid-July, which is fairly unusual for this time of year.
Maybe do a taste test first.
The bed was quite comfortable, but the A/C a bit noisy.
No worries....
We were tipped off to the Property by some good friends.
Love this place!
The one drawback is that it's not that well insulated, sound-wise.
I could hear the seagulls in the morning, and if there's a party in the hotel, you might want to bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper.
We brought friends who had never been to your hotel, and they raved about it too.
Thanks for the comfortable and friendly stay-------------------we'll be back!

A design school campus brings a funky element to the scene as well as individual artist studios.
We had our wedding reception at GI Hotel last week and couldn't have been more thrilled with the location, venue, food and overall service excellence that we received.
We were so comfortable in the hotel that it was hard to leave it to join our cruise ship (where the bed was far less comfortable).
Check in was easy.
I declined and had no problems.
Granville Island is so fun and there is so much to walk to and check out.
Staying on Granville Island you can walk to the public market every morning and you're just a bus ride into downtown.
Our stay was very satisfactory.
Overall, a very pleasant experience.
We booked this hotel on the basis of the tripadvisor reviews and it exceeded expectations.
That took us to downtown, Yaletown, the Science centre, the Space museum... and then we just walked.
I stayed here after all the rave reviews.

Being on Granville Island is a real treat.
We love Granville Island and everything it has to offer--the botique shops, public market, restaurants, theaters, and its central location in Vancouver.
The Hotel was remodeled for the 2010 Olympics.
We actually walked home one night from the GM Center, a half-hour walk.
It was exceptionally noisy.
On returning i found the key went missing from the lock I had secured to the bike.
they did agree.
Great fun for us and would be good for a family.
And they takes dogs.
Simply a lovely time for us and the sun shone!
!
A relaxed and comfortable place for families or couples.
HOWEVER, everything else was lovely.
In one part of the room, we could lay on the sofa watching television while we watched the world passing by through the large window.
I found the best gift for my friend at the Okanagan Wine Shop.
If you've never been to Granville Island in Vancouver, you should definitely stay at the Granville Island Hotel.
It was delightful!
My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
All in all, though, a very lovely stay.
Granville Island is captivating with its arts, crafts, music and market!!
Beautiful scenes abound.
Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
Enjoy!
It's even better in the early morning, before all of the people arrive for the day, when you feel you have the place to yourself.
Staying at the Granville Island Hotel, the only hotel on the island, lets you experience both personalities of Granville Island.
Friendly, clean, quiet...what more can you ask for?
Great views of False Creek.
Would stay again in a heartbeat.
I checked in no problem and they gave us a room they was sort of facing the water.
We stayed 3 nights.
They told us they thought it was a false alarm...Granville Island is a great place to visit w/kids - lots to do and a fun water park.
Granville Island is a wonderful oasis of calm right in the middle of Vancouver, there are shops, restaurants and sights all around.
Perfect
The hotel provides some wonderful views of the harbour and the rooms are modern and clean.
One of my favourite weekend retreats.
Granville Island is a shoppers bazaar by day for gifts, clothing, groceries, baked goods, quick snacks, sophisticated dining, aboriginal art and more and also popular among locals and tourists alike.
The evenings are quiet and perfect for a good nights sleep.
I couldn't have been happier with my "misfortune".
My one suggestion would be to get some in-room movies but I would definietly stay at GIH again.
We loved everything about Granville Island.
I would definitely recommend this hotel.
What a great place!
Overall it was an excellent stay, we will definitely do it again.
It features a children's carnival, which is great for families, but not very appealing to business travelers.
I thoroughly recommend it on all fronts.
Thank you for a wonderful, relaxing stay.
Sounds terrible but its not.
