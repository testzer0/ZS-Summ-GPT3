***** Golden Review 1 *****
The room itself was very nice and quite large by normal hotel standards. The small kitchenette in the room included a coffee maker, microwave oven, and a refrigerator. The beds were comfortable and the sheets good quality, but the furniture is pretty dated, and the bathroom very tired looking and small.

The Primrose is a good hotel for people who plan on staying just a few dates in Toronto and plan on only sleeping there.
The room are clean.
The bathroom needed a little work but it was good enough for my needs.
The non-free continental breakfast is a joke.
I would just find breakfast somewhere else.
In all, I would stay there again if I plan on going to Toronto to have fun.
My stay was for three days at the Primrose and I found it to be a fine hotel.
I attempted to stay there on a subsequent visit to Toronto but found it fully booked unfortunately.
The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage.
I would suggest this hotel if coming to visit the Church Street Village for nightlife and if you wish to visit the rest of the city a subway station is within easy walking distance.

When we got to our room, we got 2 separate beds and a kitchentte.
I cannot begin to explain how awful this hotel is.
The elevators are extremely slow, sometimes taking 5 minutes just to get an elevator if you are on an upper floor.
And if that elevator is full then good luck waiting for another.
It shouldn't be too bad if you're on a lower floor and you like taking the stairs.
This is especially important now that they are installing kitchenettes in some of the rooms.
Stayed here for weekend away to Toronto with wife and 13 yr old daughter.
There was popcorn on the room floor when we arrived?
Bath tub water kept leaking out when trying to have a bath.
The room itself was "OK" and the only redeeming factor was the location; which is within walking distance of all major attractions.
I would not stay there again.
It's only a two and a half star hotel so you can't expect all the luxuries of a 4 or 5 star and as a result it was well priced.
The room had 2 double beds and was reasonably spacious.
No fridge or electric jug but I think that is normal for a standard room in any hotel in North America.
We didn't complain as we had already made ourselves at home & strewn all our belongings around the room and it would have been a bother to move.
My wife and I recently took a trip to Toronto for our 35th wedding anniversary and booked in at the Primrose Hotel.
We were extremely impressed with both the hotel and the service.
The room itself was very spacious and clean.
The only issue I did not like was that the fan in the bathroom automatically turns on when you turn on the light, and usually my wife likes to sleep with the bathroom light on, but we didnâ€™t as the fan would be running.
Other than that, we were most pleased with the hotel and hope to return again on our 40th.

I stayed here for one night to watch the Rogers Cup.
Finally, we came back to the hotel at around midnight after seeing the tennis match and having dinner and come to find out that there were hookers on almost every corner surrounding the hotel.
For the price of this hotel, I would imagine a much nicer place in a better area.

The two main things I did apprieciate was, the free wireless internet, and the fact there was a Tim hortons right in the lobby.
It was a nice hotel and I will stay here again.
Mind you, we were all college age guys, not too concerned about what the place looked like.
But if you're thinking of staying at this one, pass it up.
I Stayed at the BW Primrose in early october.
Stayed in a king bed room on the 17th floor.

We recommened this hotel for families and we will certainly be coming back.
I/we have stayed at the Primrose Hotel 2 â€“ 3 times.
We choose the hotel for its proximity to the Gay Village in Toronto (Church and Wellesley area).
It was a little worn down at the edges and maybe has undergone a serious facelift since last we were there.
Several of the rooms appeared to be rented by students, either from Ryerson or the National Ballet School, both of which are very close.
As Iâ€™ve said in the past of other facilities, if you compare this hotel to others of similar value in the same general area, you would choose another establishment.
We tried this hotel and will pass on it in the future.
We stayed in Toronto at the Primrose hotel which was great cuz it was right downtown.

I've stayed in many places around the world but this was the worst.

It is very worn and in a terrible area of town.
Nothing in the room felt clean and I agree with one reviewer that the bed "crunched".
I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump.

The group in general was pleased with the rooms.

The room was great, and I was given room 1705 which had a king bed and a fantastic view.
This place is a definite choice when I return to the city.
This was one of the worst experiences I have ever with a hotel room that cost $160 a night.
The elevators were very scary and one was constantly being repaired.
There was brown stuff on the walls of the bathroom, and the room was very shabby.
It was either too hot or too cold.
We got 2 rooms at the Primrose Hotel as they were able to give us rooms with a connecting door.
The hotel was totally cool.
The room was wickedly huge and we had tons of space.
I Stayed here for 11 nights in July 2011 with my boyfriend.
We had previously booked a guesthouse which turned out to be awful so we where in a bit of a panic to get somewhere nice and affordable.
We got a room on the 16th floor with great views of the city , Our room had a big comfortable double bed.
Tv,mircowave, fridge,cooker,coffee maker, climate control,couch desk ,hairdryer and toiletries and wi fi access.
All in all I would definately recommend this hotel.
I would have switched hotels but a co-worker was already there.
I did notice the elevators seemed dated and in need of an update, but given that I was on high alert, this wasn't a big deal.
When I got to my room I was impressed.
Large room, with really nice and comfy duvets, and overall much nicer than I've seen from most hotels in Toronto in this price range.
Room and furnishings were in good shape and overall I was very impressed given I was expecting a horror show.
Found my room and the hotel in general very clean and well kept.
The hotel is was a 15min.
Took some pics on my cam phone of our two rooms and the lobby.
The hotel was great and the people at the front desk were awesome.
The room was alot bigger then most hotels i have stayed in and I liked the fact that they had duvets instead of the typical stiff sheets most places do.
The room was a pleasant surprise, considering it was a budget hotel.
Big, clean, with 2 large double beds.
I`ve never been on the 18th floor of anywhere before.
My mate came into town on my last night & there was no extra charge for the room share, which was cool.
However on arriving found the hotel room to be very spacious, clean and very comfortable.
We booked in at the Primrose Best Western Hotel after finding a decent rate online.
The room was great and large with 2 queen beds.
While the room didnâ€™t have a fridge in it which I thought was pretty standard for a hotel, they did send one up for us and install it so we could store some stuff for the kids.
While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
The sheets and the bathroom were impeccable and the stay was great.
It's not in the best part of Toronto but for the price and amenities it was a great value.
I got it for 90$CAN, so already I was pretty happy for Downtown Toronto.
The rooms were great, we were on the 6th floor, beds were comfortable and room was quite clean.
Windows opened and we were two smokers so it cleared the air.
All in all, I`d highly recommend it to anyone looking to catch a baseball weekend, or shop at the Eaton Center and such.
the hotel is centrally located and is very comfortable with a nice bed and rooms cleaned daily.
The hotel however seems to be ageing with the air con unit making a loud grinding noise and shower water sometimes talking hours to drain from the bath tub due to a blockage.
This was certainly not the greatest hotel I have ever stayed in.
I picked it because it was three stars, had internet access, and was stumbling distance from the concert two of us were attending.
I booked a single room with two beds for the four of us and it was acceptable.
Well, with the exception of the bathroom.
It was small and not very clean.
There was a 'restaurant' that never did open the three days, two nights we stayed and no room service.
None of the 'perks' of the hotel were available-pool, steam room, gym, and the TV was old and hardly worked.
I would not stay there again.
I stayed at the Primrose in Toronto several years ago, on an all-guys expedition to Canada.
We found it to be a fine hotel, there were 7 of us total, and we had 2 rooms connected.
The rooms were spacious with queen sized beds, nice bathrooms, the view was decent out of our 5th floor rooms, and we had no real issues at all as far as the hotel went.
The only thing I might mention is the fact that the hotel seems to be located right in the midst of a very prominent gay section of Toronto, and for 7 straight males, some of whom are not particularly tolerant, this could potentially have been problematic.
We were assigned two double beds and told that a King was not available.
The room was very clean and well appointed.
The only thing I did not like about this property is the lack of a indoor swimming pool or even a hot tub.
The best western has a seasonal outdoor pool only, which is no good in December.
On booking a touring holiday with a well known company I wondered what the various hotels would be like.
I can honestly say the Best Western Primrose Hotel, Toronto Downtown was one of the very best I have had the pleasure of staying in.
We spent a night in Toronto on our way to Montreal and booked in at the Primrose Hotel.
The room was large and had 2 queen beds in it.
The entire hotel was very bright and the rooms were very clean.
It was a great last minute choice and would definitely stay there again.
I booked the â€œPrimroseâ€� Best Western, downtown Toronto a few days ago for a trip that we had planned.
We arrived at 3:00 in the morning, and drove through the night to arrive to the filthiest hotel we have ever seen!
Not knowing much about hotels in Toronto, and trusting the name â€œBest Westernâ€�, we decided to save a few dollars and book online.
Exhausted, we walked into our room, and experienced the most overwhelming foul smells, I canâ€™t even describe!
My husband laughed when he saw the conditions of the bathroom.
A bathtub so filthy I wouldnâ€™t dare stand to take a shower.
The room was so filthy, we decided to leave, and find another hotel.
We didnâ€™t realize that the Primrose Best Western hotel was in the middle of a large prostitution area, until we left and noticed the building was surrounded by dozens of prostitutes.
When we arrived at the Hilton (which we really couldnâ€™t afford, but were tired and in desperate need of a clean place to stay), staff noted that â€œThe Primroseâ€� Best Western was know for their bedbugs!!!
PLEASE, save yourself the bother, spend the extra few dollars, and go to a reputable hotel!!!
The room was very large but made for a small bathroom.
Very big comfortable bed.
Went to Toronto for a weekend â€œstaycationâ€� and got a cheap room online at the Primrose Hotel.
There was a bit of a wait for the elevators but a group had just checked in, so had to wait a few extra minutes while the 50 plus ppl all went up.
The room itself was nice.
Had a room with 1 king bed which was comfortable.
Lots of good restaurants in the area too.
Not a bad place to spend a weekend.
We just came back from this hotel.
The staff was very polite, rooms were clean, and the hotel has a great location.
We were given a room on the 12th floor with a south view so we had a view of downtown, CN Tower, and Lake Ontario.
As I mentioned before, the room was clean.
Very comfortable bed, a small kitchenette in the room (coffee maker, microwave oven, and a refrigerator).
We are huge fans of their breakfast menu but there were only a few choices available- very few muffins and bagels.
No Breakfast sandwiches for meat lovers like myself.
The elevators are a little slow as some other reviews indicated.
Recently went to Toronto to meet up with some friends and got a room for cheap at the Primrose hotel.
I was given a room on the 3rd floor since I donâ€™t like elevators very much and it was easy to use the stairs to get to the room.
It was a decent sized room and had a desk and a couch in it.
Wouldnâ€™t hesitate to go back there.
My friends and I decided to stay at this hotel for two nights because the price was so good.
The hotel was dirty.
The shower was disgusting and there were marks all over the walls and carpet.
The hallways were also very dim and can be scary at night.
The elevators took forever!
I guess this hotel would be ok for people who are looking to party.
Swimming pool only open when lifeguard is there from 10a to 9p.
Musty smell, but pretty clean in the room.
Hallways dingy, but staff is nice and helpful.
Free soda with meal at "Made in China" and dinner specials from $5.99!
The elevators are very small, it is cramped with 4 people with luggage.
Went to Toronto to celebrate the big 3-0 with some friends and found a room online at the Primrose Hotel.
The room we had was on the 20th floor and had 2 huge bedsâ€¦..definitely not a standard double bed I am used to in hotel rooms.
Room was clean and the lady who cleaned the room was nice enough to give us triple the towels in the room.
My suggestion for the hotel though is try to get a room away from the elevator.
Had planned to stay at the Royal York since it was across the street, but ended up at the Primrose Hotel since the rate was about $60 cheaper a night.
The room itself was very nice and quite large by normal hotel standards.
it's clearly aging, but on the plus side, this means large rooms that were impeccably clean on check-in and throughout my week-long stay.
i ended up in a two double beds room near the top floor.
the beds were fantastic.
the pool area is scarily dirty, full with pigeons, so you might want to skip this offering to stay well.
the gym is located in two adjacent rooms, and for the price category of this hotel is nothing to complain about.
great stuff, not one of those sneaky hotels that tries to sell you this sort of thing at extortionate rates after you booked.
My husband and I stayed at the hotel the last week in August.
We were very pleased with our choice.
The room was nice and very comfortable.
We are heartbroken and will never recommend this hotel to anyone.
My wife and I have been staying at the Primrose Hotel for years.
Simply put Its a clean, well run hotel, with excellent service at the front desk and very large rooms that look great.
2) Our favorite bottle of wine is waiting for us in the room 3) Reservations are made at our favorite restauraunt 4) Staff know us by our first names 5) My wife gets a birthday email on her birthday 6) The staff truly feels like family TRY THIS hOTEL you wont be disapointed!
I stayed at the Primrose for ten days and I did like the beds as well as the location of the hotel.
The room itself was spacious with a king size bed, a sofa, desk, coffee maker (which I did not use), and a chair.
Other than the hotel is OK, but far from great.
The rooms are tired with many defects (both my rooms had faults including bulbs out, loose headboard and loose bathroom fittings.
Breakfast was fairly average too.
We stayed at this hotel throughout our stay in Canada.
We got a large room with two double beds and a coffee maker.
We arrived late well past the check-in time and were worried about getting a good room.
We picked a non smoking room with two double beds.There are several restaurants in this area.
For the price we paid for this hotel and the round trip airfare booked through Travelocity, it was a steal.
Recently spent a night in Toronto to do some shopping and stayed overnight at the Primrose Hotel after finding a good price online.
Was happy with the hotel overall.
The room was good and had a nice view.
Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
We stayed in their studio which consisted of 2 beds refrigeraror microwave eating area.
It was a very large room for a great price.
The hotel was very clean and centrally located.
There is also an outdoor pool on the 3rd floor.
#3) Sauna listed as an immenity.
Go in your clothes because it never heats up and this was in the winter.
#4) Gave me coupons for the free continental breakfast.
So we went to Toronto for a girlâ€™s weekend out and booked 2 rooms at the Primrose Hotel online after finding a good deal on Hotwire.
We were able to get adjoining rooms which was perfect and each had 2 beds in them.
We had a fantastic weekend out, and the hotel was perfect for what we needed.
Almost decided to move to another hotel, but didn't because didn't want to go in hassle of moving the luggage with kids, etc.
Gloomy room.
Despite it being a kitchenette, it was a joke to have a little stove, no cutleries provided unless asked.
This is a decent hotel, but factor in the low prices, great location and little perks like free wi-fi, and I'd say that it's one of the best I've stayed in.
Not a luxury hotel by any means, but great value for the price.
The room was big, clean and quite nice, the bed was very comfortable, there was plenty of hot water... the basics were covered.
A few very minor complaints - the bathroom was very small and a bit cold, since the only heat was from a small baseboard heater.
Wound up staying at this hotel by mistake (my wife booked the wrong hotel online).
Was a little worried given that it wasn't one of the higher end chains, but we were pleasantly surprised.
Staff was extra friendly, room was large and clean, had a great view of the city and we were walking distance to just about everything.
It's not a highend hotel, but it's great value for the price.
My room connects with another room and you can hear the neighbour's television blasting and their conversations.
The elevators are super slow.
I do not recomemnd taking the elevators in the morning if you are only a few flights from the main floor because people are sardined in the elevator please take the stairs.
The bathroom has mold on the ceiling and the toilet paper is like tissue paper.
The room thermostat doesn't stay the same temperature.
So if you are coming to Primose hotel I would recommend coming during may through august because that's when all the college students and noise is gone.
I think they should use the money that they have ripped off people and take some time to fix up their hotel.
The room was clean there were no stains anywhere, nice bed and dÃ©cor was good.
People stay in hotels and expect them to be newly decorated for them rooms have to be used and accommodating.
We stayed with a tour on 9/10 September and would have no hesitation at staying or recommending this hotel again.
My partner has worked in hotels for over 30 years and a lot of it in management and he would know a bad one as soon as he walked in.
We normally take pictures of the rooms we stay in but unforunately did not on this occassion, if had they would have been put on here good or bad.
I would never step into that hotel.
Room serviced daily.
My firm booked me into the Primrose Hotel for a conference I had to attend in the city.
The hotel was very nice, and looks like they are doing renovations.
Was offered a double (no thanks!)
and waited about 10 min until our room was ready.
Clean accomodations, location was less than 10 minute walk to subway station.
My only real complaint is that the elevators were very slow and the computers in the business centre were slow as well.
Also disappointed that pool was only outdoor/seasonal.
However, sauna looked nice and clean although did not use it.
I had to stay an extra night in Toronto and found that my existing hotel (Sheraton Centre) was sold out for the Monday so I had to make a last minute reservation at another hotel.
As Toronto was heavily booked up for the evening, I had to stay at the Best Western Primrose, and I was happy it was only for a single night.
The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service.
The elevators are very small, so getting a cart and two bodies into the tight space was a difficult.
The room is pretty much the same quality as the rest of the hotel and was definately a 1 to 2 star experience.
We've stayed at the Primrose several times over the last few months, and have had generally good experiences.
The rooms are reasonably clean, the beds fairly comfortable, and the staff mostly helpful.
The Hotel is located fairly close to the centre of Toronto.
We complained and was moved to a room a few floors below,that had already been refurbed.
I do not understand why the hotel website did not advise of the works,and the management didnt seem to have an answer either.
This was my first time travelling to Toronto and I must say this hotel ruined it for me.
My first room had a window that would not close, so I did not have much time to look around, I went to the front desk and asked to have my room switched.
My second room also had a window that would not close, there were beer caps scattered throughout the room, there was hair in the tub and on the toilet seat, and the room smelt like an ashtray.
I would never ever stay at this hotel again, and may never stay at a best western again.
This was my second stay at the Best Western Primrose in the past year and I would have no hestitation in staying again.
I booked a smoking room with a king-size bed.
It was a business class room, which I didn't really need, but I had anticipated having someone else come along on this trip.
The room also included a sofa bed.
The room was spacious and clean with an extremely comfortable bed.
Is the hotel showing signs of wear?
Sure, it's not a new hotel.
Close to good restaurants.
Great hotel and great price.
You also got two pillows each without asking.
We are going to stay there again for sure next time we visit Toronto.
I got a room at the Best Western Primrose for a very reasonable rate.
The hotel was great, and I was pleased with the room.
I thought the rooms were very well kept and the bedding looked new.
When traveling on business again, I would not hesitate to use this hotel in the future.
The room was clean, and had a great view.
The rooms are in need of a remodel.
The bathrooms are dated.
I stayed at the Best Western Primrose for one night, mid-week.
We had a King bed which was comfy and the pillows were great.
The room was dated and the bathroom was the same.
The furnishings, lighting, and carpets were nothing fancy.
No problems in the bathroom, although the toiletries were pretty cheap.
There was a nice sitting area and free wireless access.
The pool was closed as it is outdoor and opens in the spring.
The only problem was that even with 4 elevators, it was common to wait for a full minute for one.
Had a stop over in Toronto on my way to Montreal and wound up at the Best Western Primrose Hotel (on Carltone St) Much larger Best Western than I've ever stayed at.
Large comfortable room & bed.
Large comfortable room & bed.
Excellent breakfast in the AM as well.
My husband and I stayed at this hotel for several nights in June, and were very disappointed.
Also, the hotel is a high rise with only a few elevators which the staff also use.
The elevators are VERY SLOW and we routinely spent several minutes waiting for them.
We didn’t have a reservation anywhere, but the Primrose Hotel was the closest hotel and so we were able to get a room without at reservation.
We really didn’t need much other than a place that was close to a restaurant and internet access, both of which they had (internet was free too unlike other places I have been to).
The room was clean and comfortable.
I wan't expecting much from this hotel and that's what I got.
The general feeling of this hotel was tired and run down.
We had to switch rooms the first night due to plumbing issues (shower didn't work, toilet leaked).
The hotel is older but the room was huge and had a view all the way to the lake.
Luckily it wasn't like any Best Western I had ever been to - this is a large full service hotel.
Room was BIG, bed was comfy, had an a good size fridge in it too and it's the first hotel I've been to in a while where the internet was free and fast.
Area was pretty cool too, lots of little restaurants in walking distance (great Chinese place right across the street.)
And just like my stay out at the airport, I made the mistake of not paying attention to the breakfast prices before I started ordering.
What is it with $20 hotel breakfasts in Toronto?
Anyway, I saw a sign for a breakfast place right next door that said $4.99 bacon & eqqs - I'll know for next time.
This was my 4th trip to Toronto and my second time staying at the Primrose Hotel.
I also noticed lots of changes in the rooms.
The room was perfect for us, and had 2 queen beds and a great view of the lake (we were on the 20th floor).
I've travelled to Toronto before and this hotel, I would consider to be below average.
Although most of the staff were nice, the rooms were dated and could use some renovation.
Overall, a good central location for the price I paid, but I choose another hotel if given the choic again.
On the upside this place is reasonable priced and the rooms are clean, quiet, and with comfortable beds.
Beware of what looks like a continental breakfast as it is not nor are there any signs indicating charge.
The breakfast is $12.95 for pre cooked eggs, bacon,etc.
My company recently booked a training session at the Primrose Hotel in Toronto.
We occupied the Starlight room on the 23rd floor and found the room to be ideal for our training sessions.
Booked this Hotel for a three night stay at the beginning of my holiday to Canada, and was very pleased with my choice.
Room was spacious, spotlessly clean and I had a great view of the Toronto skyline from the 19th floor.
Thank you very much Best Western Primrose.
We had one of their kitchenette rooms that had a microwave, small fridge, coffee maker and counter/sink area; complete with utensils, although I brought my own disposable ones.
The beds/pillows are by far the best feature.
They are comfortable with nice bedding.
The bathroom was average.
The biggest disappointments were: -Elevators (being "updated", bumpy ride, not reliable-ended up on a floor we didn't know we could access!)
Had daily continental or hot breakfast for an unreasonable cost for the 'menu' - try the local restaurants or delivery) Overall, reasonable cost for duration; comfortable, quiet, clean rooms; and you receive Best Western Club points or Airmiles for your stay.
My wife and I recently attended a wedding in Toronto and stayed at the Primrose Hotel as it was close to the reception.
We were given room 1904 which had a large king bed and sitting area.
The room was clean and well decorated.
The bed was extremely comfortable.
I found however that the room was a little dark at night though as there were several lamps but only an overhead light by the door.
We had a good time in the city and would use the Primrose Hotel again.
Over all our hotel was clean and we had a newly renovated room.
I was very pleased with the arrangements made, and since we werenâ€™t exactly sure how many rooms we needed, the hotel allowed us to reserve 15 rooms, and provided we told them a few weeks in advance, didnâ€™t charge us for the rooms which we didnâ€™t need.
They were also able to give us rooms all on the same floor which made things much easier to get ready on the morning of the wedding.
We ended up with 12 rooms in total and no one in our group had any problems or complaints.
