***** Sentences in Cluster ****
I thought that was OK, so I accepted the room and settled in.
A few minutes later this person came to my room and handed me a key to another room that happened to have its line fixed already for that night.
The room itself was up to Marriott's usual standards - well done, not over-the-top luxurious, but very nice.
I recommend this hotel, especially if you want to do a bit of shopping.
The room was what most would call the "typical Marriott room."
Excellent housekeeping and the usual amenities; plenty of room for one person.
Bed comfortable; furniture, carpeting, drapes in good repair.
Breakfast in the hotel each morning; buffet style with eggs cooked to order and nice selection of the usual breakfast items, breads, etc.
Used the pool and whirlpool once; the area was clean and all the equipment in the adjacent fitness center in working order.
The hotel is about one and a half blocks from the Dundas Subway stop which can be reached by indoor PATH walkway; hotel is adjacent to Eaton Centre and has an interior walkway to the Sears store next door.
This hotel was extremely luxurious and the view was fantastic.
I loved that stay and I don't think there is a better hotel in Canada than that Marriott!
This place is very clean, its got THE MOST comfortable beds, and the location is great.
The bathrooms were clean and the rooms have been updated.
The hotel has a very modern look and feel to it.
The rooms also have new big screen tvs which was nice.
One of the things that make people willing to pay a lot of money for this place is because the hotel has a walkway that goes right into the eaton centre mall.
Also a lot of the rooms face an office building, so theres not much privacy, because the curtains are very easily seen through, but overall if your willing to pay over 250 a night, your really only paying for the location and the walkway to the mall.
My spouse and I decided to spend one night at the Marriott Downtown as a pre-10 yr wedding anniversary.
The hotel sure didn't dissapoint!
Although the one bedroom suite was on the 5th floor by the elevators, the room was perfect.
for us We had a living area and a very comfy king bed and amazingly comfy pillows.
Wonderful views and the gym was very well equpped with the latest machines and free weights.
This is a must stay hotel for anyone wanting to truly explore the Toronto downtown core with ease.
We stayed three nights in this hotel and found it to be quite excellent.
Because the hotel backs onto a small courtyard, you could not hear any street noise.
(see photo) The breakfast buffet was a little expensive but the food and service were both very good.
The rooms were Marriott quality with all the requisite amenities you would expect.
This was my second visit to this hotel (the last time was for a conference a few years ago).
Of all of the Toronto Marriott properties, this is the most central.
The breakfast was top-notch including a wide variety of fresh produce.
Compared to my last stay, my room was a little disappointing.
It really needed a bit of a â€œrefreshâ€�.
Even the bed was not quite as comfortable (it sagged a little in the middle), as a normal Marriott bed.
This is a nice hotel with average amenities.
It is right downtown and shares the bluck with the eaton Centre.
This hotel is connected to Eaton Center, which is the biggest and best shopping mall downtown.
There are tons of excellent restaurants close by for pretty much every taste and budget.
The room I had was at the end of the hall, so it was exceptionally quiet, and the bed was great.
Stayed here for two nights in July.
Bathroom was spotless and seemed very new.
Hi, we stayed at Marriott in March with a four year old and a teenager.
We were upgraded to a nicer room simply when asking if our room would be big enough for all of us.
The breakfast on room service and in the hotel (buffet and menu) are both pretty pricey (around 18$ each approx).
Nice plush chairs to relax and drink, and you can sign the drinks up to your room.
The pool didn't have a shallow end for small children, so if you have a younger child you have to hold them the whole time.
Work out room is past the pool, seems to have quite a few good machines, small room though.
Pool glass enclosed walls to see city from high up floor (top?).
Room was clean but small- could say the same about the pool!
Room was clean but small- could say the same about the pool!
The hotel is in a great location and staff were efficient and polite.
Really no complaints about anything except the shower - which matters.
I was on the 10th floor, it took forever for the shower to get hot and when it did the temperature fluctuated radically from luke warm to scalding.
It's amazing how not being able to have a normal shower can affect my overall impression but it does.
There is a lovely indoor pool and Jacuzzi on the roof as well.
We stayed at the Marriott Eaton Centre for part of our honeymoon.
The hotel was great.
We enjoyed nearly everything about the hotel.
There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.
This hotel is very good.
It's not excellent, but it is a very good Marriott.
It's a little scary to walk around late night by yourself, but othewise, it's fine.
Excellent rate of 3 nights for the price of 2 provided a huge room with ample storage facilities, Plasma TV and safe.
Bed rather soft for me.
Decent, but small 18th floor pool and gym overlooking the City.
It means breakfast on the last day is either cash of charge card.
This is a renovated Marriott with an above average lobby and room.
However, we found this hotel to be pleasant and clean.
The bed was comfortable.
I was told upon booking that the double beds may not be available; this was confirmed upon check-in.
The room we were given had a King Bed and pull-out sofa.
This was not a problem as there were only 3 of us - 2 shared the King bed, and 1 took the sofa bed.
We were assigned a room on the 15th floor, which was beautiful.
The room was also excellent, as I was on the end and had a view of the CN Tower.
This Marriott was also within walking distance of the Toronto subway, and the walk was well-lit and safe.
The hotel staff told me to get off at the Sheraton station.
Quiet, clean, modern room.
I stayed in this hotel on two occasions, first in June 2007 and then again in 2010.
The hotel is very clean, the rooms were a good price for the quality received, and, best of all, the location can't be beat.
I'd highly recommend this hotel for people who plan to tour Toronto and are looking for a decent value.
The rooms are nice and spacious An feature all you'd expect from the brand.
The Hotel itself is fine and we had no complaints about anything.
The hotel is a short walk to Eaton Centre, We also walked to the Hockey Hall of Fame ,and the Skydome..although at night I would take a cab.
We spent four nights here in November as an add-on to a business trip.
You can get to the hotel easily via the Toronto Airport Express Bus, and it's just $30CN roundtrip.
The hotel has a funny site and faces sideways--it's not too impressive when you walk up, but everything changes when you enter.
The property looks recently renovated, and the room was spacious and comfortable.
I would stay here again in a minute--loved Toronto and the hotel.
Beds are to die for, so comfortable.
Gym is amazing, if you are so inclined, and so is the view...from 18th floor.
Then hard to get out as Mcguinty crew in town and elevators shut down once again.
Stayed at the Marriott Eaton Centre for a conference.
Oh and if you are a husband leave your wallet at home as the hotel is connected to the Eaton Centre; shopping mecca for wives !!!!!
The staff was outstanding, the rooms were a bit small but very clean and with the most comfortable beds.
The Downtown Marriot is good for exploring the city since everything is within walking distance (if you do not mind to walk a bit across a city which I think is the best way to get the vibe of a city).
We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.
We'll come back (although it is not cheap...).
I stayed at the hotel with my family of 4 and my mother last weekend and we were really pleased with the hotel.
The rooms were large and nicely appointed.
The beds were comfortable.
You would think the 4 elevators would be empty at that hour.
We stayed on the 5th floor of the18 floor hotel and never had a chance to get on an elevator.
Finally, we dragged our bags down the 4 flights of stairs.
The rest of the hotel was nice but a little dated.
Tiled bathtub was clean as was the rest of the room.
The beds were nice and we had a view of the church next door.
But there are so many hotel options for Toronto that we'll probably given another one a try next time.
Stayed at the Marriott for three nights for a conference.
The room was typically Marriott - very nice, great view of the Church and gardens in between the Eaton Centre.
Also had a problem with the shower - very hot...but not an issue.
I have just has my 2nd visit to this hotel in two years.
The Parkside breakfast was the best buffet breakfast I have ever had.
We recently spent the weekend at the Marriott Eaton Centre.
Our room was very nice, we asked for a lower level and got it with no problem.
The hotel has indoor access to the Eaton Centre, which is great - you can come back to your room for a break any time.
Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great hotel in a central location for shopping/entertainment.
This is a nice hotel, typical Marriott, with an excellent location.
I had a pretty big room and bed was comfortable.
We stayed in a one bedroom suite with a connecting dbl / dbl (5 of us).
While the beds were comfy and we had plenty of room, the guest rooms are in need of a renovation.
Had all standard amenities including coffee maker and fridge and robes .
We then called the Marriott rewards program, and they said they would give us 1,000 points for our hassle.
Described as a business hotel the Eaton Centre Marriott is also well suited for leisure breaks, situated close to a range of attractions the hotel provides an ideal base to explore Toronto.
We had connecting rooms, these were prepared to a very high standard, house keeping do a first class job in this hotel.
We were attending the show WE WILL ROCK YOU and decided to stay at the Marriott Eaton Centre due to the close proximity of the theatre we were attending.
The hotel is marvelous, their renovations are complete and they did a wonderful job, we had a room with king bed, great tv in the room and it was a very spacious room.
I give this hotel high marks and will definitely return.
We stayed at Marriott Eaton for 02 nights and the hotel was up to our expection.
We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds ( 04 people ) and it was not so comfortable as we are used to sleep in a King Size bed back home.
The breakfast was awesome !
We just returned from a weekend stay at the Marriott Eaton Centre.
Our in-room safe wasn't working properly, but that was corrected while we went out for an afternoon exploration of Toronto.
We will certainly consider staying at this hotel again.
I stayed at the Marriott for a conference and it was pretty good.
The hotel is located at the heart of downtown Toronto and very close to where my conference was.
The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.
The room was like any standard 4 star hotel room.
I would go back there again for business or leisure.
Itâ€™s probably a 20-minute walk (rough guess and depends how fast you walk) to the Harbour Front with loads of restaurants (I ate at the Watermark Irish Pub).
I had a huge bed, flat screen TV, comfortable chairs, coffee maker (and real cream is provided!).
I just spent the night there so didnâ€™t scout for a lot of dining area.
The next morning I had the croissant and pastry for breakfast making my own coffee in the room.
Stayed at the Marriott for three nights for a Conference.
The room was very nice, a good view and the bed was very, very comfortable.
The shower however was very touchy and the water was either scalding hot or very cold.
(1) Location of the hotel is ideal , my wife was thrilled as it was within short walling distance to the Eaton center one of the largest shopping centers in Toronto (2) Room is spacious compared to other 4 star hotels, good furniture, clean and neat (3) Good entertainment with LCD 37 inch TV with on demand movies and more (4) Staff are friendly and professional, good staffing numbers very adequate (5) Breakfast was great and included in the price of around US$ 200 per night , very fair price for this hotel, the breakfast included fresh fruits (Produce of Canada) and eggs and an egg station and many other delights
Hotel has comfortable atmosphere and lounge on main floor is relaxing.
Room was perfect.
Nice courtyard right outside hotel as you head to Eaton Centre.
My friend and I stayed at this hotel in September 2011 during the TIFF weekend.
The room was clean, spacious and even included a pull out couch!
The bed was comfortable with lots of pillows.
My only complaint would be that the room could be more sound proof.
Aside from that, the room was great.
It's best asset is the central Toronto location and beautiful public areas.
However, the rooms are very average (no safe, mini-bar for example).
During my stay, the first room I was given had a locked adjoining door.
The room next to mine was obviously a large suite occupied by several people.
Finally I called at midnight to insist on another room which they gave me.
My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.
I will not stay there again.
I stayed here on two seperate occasions within a two week period.
Plenty of options for dinner around Dundas square.
Beds are very comfortable and staff are numerous and helpful.
The gym is huge and well equiped.
The rooms are medium size, has a desk and a small lounge and coffee table.
You are paying a premium price for being in the centre of the city and staying in a well maintained hotel, but I thought it was worth it.
I'll be staying here again.
We had stayed in this hotel half-a-dozen times in the past and had been very impressed with it.
The rooms are large and the food in the dining room is decent enough.
Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
We went to the front desk, showed the front clerk that I was bleeding and explained my situation.
Great place to stay for the location and comfy beds- but that's about it.
Cannot complain about hotel.
I have been meaning to post this positive review of the Eaton Centre Marriott in Toronto for a year now!
We loved the Eaton Centre Marriott - the lobby has a nice cocktail bar and good steak restaurant and with a modern art look.
Being Marriott Rewards members, we got a lovely upgraded room with access to the concierge lounge and good views.
If you have been to one Marriott, you know what to expect at basically all of them and that can be comforting when in a new place.
This hotel was a nicer style than most and ranked up there with the downtown waterfront Seattle Marriott for style and a cool bar to chill at in the lobby.
Stayed for three nights as a family, couldn't be more central for all the downtown attractions, everything's within walking distance and the hotel is connected by a walkway to the Eaton Centre.
The pool on the top floor was perfect for a wee splash around and the room was clean, tidy and a decent size.
I travel to Toronto alot and always use this hotel.
It is convenient to my office, but I am always impressed the friendly and professional staff, nice rooms and good food.
I recently spent 3 nights at the Marriott Eaton Centre while attending a conference.
The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.
Overrall, my room was a comfortable place to spend some time (I liked the large flat panel tv), while the rest of the hotel was unexciting.
The rooms are clean and the beds are extremely comfortable...it was actually hard to get up in the morning!
All in all a great hotel - not a cheap stay but worth it in my opinion.
Clean, comfortable, new...will definitely stay again if the price is right!!
We love this hotel!
This was our second stay at this property and although it wasn't quite the same as our visit for New Year's Eve it will continue to be our favourite place to stay in Toronto.
It is connected by a walkway to the Eaton Centre and when you park at the hotel (valet is the way for only $25) you can get just about anywhere on foot, bus, or subway.
One night stay in a king size room, champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, valet parking, and the most amazing buffet breakfast are all included for $220-$250 depending on the time of year.
The bathroom products are stellar and each room has a coffee maker.
We stayed at this hotel, with our 2 young children, at the start of April 2005.
We were very impressed with the hotel in general.
Our room was large, well furnished and clean.
It was a non smoking room - at all other hotels in which we have stayed in Toronto have also given us non smoking rooms but all have smelt of smoke, this was not the case with the Marriott.
The pool was quite small, but suitable for the children to use.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Toronto (we have high expectations from hotels, which can sometimes cause disappointment -not so this time!)
The bed was just to die for - perfect sleep.
Great pool (warm and clean) and hot tub (the cleaning guy let us stay late that evening - thank you!)
Room service breakfast was $20 for nothing too special.
There is a beautiful courtyard with cobblestones and a church between the outside of the Marriott and the Eaton center.
We stayed 2 nights and found the hotel to be generally very good.
My only quibbles were with the bathroom.
The toilet did not flush properly and the shower seemed to have only 2 temperatures: scalding hot or freezing cold.
Getting to our room was fine as there are many elevators that access the guest room floors.
Overall a very good hotel to use as a base for exploring Toronto but not quite up to the Marriott standards I have come to expect.
The hotel was very clean, the hotel staff were very friendly and information, and it was close to public transportation, which we used for our entire time in Toronto.
This is an excellent hotel.
They have the best breakfast buffet I have ever seen at a Marriott.
It is much pricier than what you will find in the U.S. but if you like breakfast it may be worth it.
There is also an indoor fireplace area where you can sit inside by the fire and eat and read if you like.
I really enjoyed staying at the Marriott Eaton Centre.
I had not been to Toronto for years and didn't realize how walkable most of the central city is, especially from this hotel, which is conveniently located just blocks from culture, food, shopping and transportation.
The hotel staff was friendly and efficient, our room was clean and spacious and the amenities made it feel very upscale.
First 3 nights went smooth.
Clean hotel, well located.
The room was a good size and looked out over the church next door, plus it was useful to be able to go straight through into the Eaton Centre.
I requested a King size bed but was surprised at how small the room was.
I can get free internet at the airport, train station, most every coffee shop in town, but at a +$300 a night hotel I have to pay extra for it?
The bathroom was small and not as contemporary as I was expecting.
The only positive thing I have to say would be that the exercise room was pretty good.
18th floor with big windows and a nice view.
The hotel also has a nice indoor pool and hot tub for relaxing.
My wife enjoyed the gym which had new and excellent machines.
The rooms seem to have been recently updated and are well kept.
We were attending a conference in the hotel so we basically had no choice when it came to picking a hotel in Toronto.
We were given our king size room which we had booked months earlier.
Room : The room was just another hotel room , nothing flash but it was comfortable.
The room consisted of a king size bed , small settee , coffee table and working desk with internet connection.
The bathroom was on the small size with shower over the bath.
Breakfast : A good selection with a chef cooking omelettes.
Overall : The Marriott Hotel served a purpose and we had a comfortable stay.
I have stayed here on 2 separate trips to Toronto in the last 14 months and really enjoyed each stay.
Clean modern rooms, reasonably good service, excellent concierge, good restaurant.
It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.
To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.
The effect in the small room was to feel as if the ceiling and walls were closing in on us.
The bathroom was the highlight, fairly basic and clean but small with meagre towels and toiletries.
Breakfast was reasonable but unremarkable and the service very hit and miss.
The pool was pleasant enough for our daughter to play in but would be much to small for exercising in.
During our recent trip we stayed in 5 hotels in Canada and this was by far the worst.
It's also quite cozy so it's almost like you're at home.
This is the second time we've stayed at this hotel.
I was happy to get this hotel for $159/night - though internet was slow and added $16 dollars per day (though it included all calls - or so i thought until i got my bill and they had charged me $40 worth of long distance calls - they were promptly removed).
hotel room was small but clean and comfortable.
TV was good, bathroom was clean/marble.
my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.
The hotel was clean and modern and the King room was spacious, with the most comfortable bed (slept better than at home).
The ballrooms and meeting rooms were well kept and allowed for great meetings by day and fun parties in the evening.
Not sure if that's a regular occurrence, but again, it's a nice hotel attached to the Eaton Center mall pretty close to the water (within walking distance).
I recently stayed at Marriott Eaton Center and had a wonderful stay.
The hotel is modern and the lobby is inviting.
Our dinner was memorable with a nice atmosphere, delicious food and the service friendly and helpful.
We also had breakfast there, as when you pay for the concierge rate you eat off the buffet in the restaurant, which includes made to order eggs, etc.
Just came back from a four night stay at the Marriott Downtown Eaton Centre, and I was completely satisfied with this hotel.
The room was great: quiet, roomy, comfortable beds and good ventilation.
Enjoyed the spacious bathroom with lots of counter space for all the toiletries that my daughter and I had.
While we didnâ€™t get the free breakfast others have mentioned, we ended up at a tiny place across the street called The Daily Brew.
Stayed at the Marriott with my husband and 3 year old daughter.
Rooms were spacious and updated - flat screen tv, newer furniture.
Our only complaint is that the bed wasn't very comfortable.
Would stay here again.
This hotel is awesome for several reasons.
Huge rooms, clean and renovated.
Great staff, this hotel knows what they are doing and when I stay in downtown Toronto they are always my first choice.
We have stayed at this Marriott many times but this was our first time back since the renovation and it did not disapoint.
Rooms were spotless, and big enough.
The buffett breakfast which was included with our rate was good every morning and better than most hotels.
The pool is small but sufficent.
We stayed in this hotel for the weekend (April 15-17, 2011).
I was very impressed with this, and so we stayed, and so far, no problems.
Very decent hotel, with super location and pleasant staff.
The room was comfortable, the staff was nice and helpful.
I didn't use the pool, but it really seemed small.
This hotel was okay, nothing special.
The room was a standard hotel room, nothing special or unique.
All in all, I'd say this hotel is ok. Price needs to go down a bit and staff friendliness up some.
The room was comfortable and well-equipped...except for a small fridge that I was unable to obtain during my stay.
It turned out to be a very good choice for me.
The rooms are spacious and beds very comfortable, unfortunately there was no bottled water in the room which was disappointing given the hotel standard but this is my only downside of the stay.
There is however a coffee/tea making machine and the bathroom is ample sized.
I wanted to order roomservice breakfast but had missed the midnight deadline for putting the order on my doorhandle however a quick call to reception and I was assured that this could still be managed.
Breakfast arrived right on time and was delicious (scrambled egs, well done bacon, juice and tea...perfect!).
Rest of the hotel - room, location, front desk staff, etc.
I stayed for three nights at the Marriott Eaton Centre, which I really enjoyed.
The hotel offers you the advantage of being connected through a tunnel to the Eaton Centre, a very pleasant shopping mall.
It might have been one of the best ones I had so far with its wide selection of pretty much anything you would want for breakfast.
The room was clean and spacious.
The bed was comfortable.
Overall, I think this is a good choice if you're staying in Toronto for a few days and want to hang around the city center.
My husband and I are in our late 20's and stayed at Toronto Marriott Downtown Eaton Centre in early June.
The breakfast that is served at the hotel is wonderful!!
This hotel is wonderful.
The beds at the Marriot were SO comfortable I would have been ok with just lounging in bed all weekend and never seeing the rest of city!
Not only that, but the rooms were spotlessly clean, the amenities were nice and our view was spectacular.
It's a nice clean, quiet hotel in a great area.
We enjoyed our stay at the Marriott Eaton Centre with a few minor quibbles.
The room was decent size for Toronto and was very clean.
The only negative for the guestroom was that the shower seemed to take an inordinately long time to achieve warm/hot water...literally 2-3 minutes.
The king bed was super comfortable â€“ you literally just sink right in, it feels so delicious just lying down.
The room we had was a decent size and had a nice view.
We usually check out the amenities of every hotel we stay at but on this stay we had a long full day and just had time to settle in for a good nightâ€™s rest.
Nice and clean gym on the top, typical hotel breakfast available downstairs.
