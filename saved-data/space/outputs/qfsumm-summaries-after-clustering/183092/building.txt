***** Model produced summary *****
Fire alarm at 5.20 am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant ! Under that mall is the subway station , so you can actually get on the subway without ever going outside . Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel !
***** Golden Review 1 *****
Toronto Marriott Downtown Eaton Centre Hotel was very modern, nicely decorated with a fitness center (pool included) on the top floor.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The hotel has a very modern look and feel to it, with a nice, kid-friendly indoor pool and hot tub on the rooftop for relaxation and city views. The lobby was modern with a beautiful fireplace and a good breakfast/coffee/drinks bar too.
***** Golden Review 3 *****

and said that I really needed to do some work on my computer and I asked whether they could not speed up the repair on the line.
Its a pretty cool thing to be able to walk right into torontos biggest mall in just two minutes.

The lobby is very appealing and the front desk staff were professional and polite.
There was also someone roaming around the lobby to help guests with any questions.
The lobby refurb looked great -- now they just need to tackle some of the older rooms.
Under that mall is the subway station, so you can actually get on the subway without ever going outside.
Think it's in real need of refurbishment.

The subway is about a block away in the basement of the mall.
The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
It has a lovely, light lobby filled with professionals who are friendly and helpful!
Sadly, we missed the reopening of the Art Gallery of Ontario by a week, but that's definitely within walking distance of the hotel.
Kensington Market and the Brewery District were the longest shlepps and those walks might not be for all, but we really enjoyed them and had fun detouring through the nearby neighborhoods.
Had some idiot pull fire alarm at 4 am on Sunday, but was resolved within 30 minutes and not having to evacuate.
Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.
We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.
Six times the doors opened and closed packed to the gills.
Bonus, no need to go out with a coat since the Marriott has indoor access to the Eaton Center...Shoppers Heaven for sure!!!
It is connected to the Eaton Centre and there is a subway station there.
While there is a garbage strike going on, the city was still relatively clean and everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful.
The lobby was nicely decorated and the staff were nice.
The hotel lobby was very spacious, and well furnished with comfy seating for tired travellers to wait while checking-in.
In addition to being spacious, the lobby was decorated in a modern fashion with booth-like check-in desk, complete with a very professional and courteous staff who checked us in promptly.
Modern facility, quiet.
The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

They also really need more than 1 elevator to the parking garage.
The wait for an elevator to the parking garage was quite long.
One small window that didn't open.
The mall can be accessed through the hotel without going outside.
Only downside was at 2am someone decided to light a cigarette in a stairwell and set off the smoke alarm causing all of the hotel guests to be evacuated.
One guest's inconsiderate action should not reflect upon the property.
We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
My only advice is to ask for a room opposite the construction side...
Everything was as expected, good check in, great location, nice room, good staff, etc....then about 11:00pm the fire alarms went off.
In the lobby there is a lounge area surrounding a free standing fireplace that is enjoyable to sit around and chat.
The lobby was nice.
Great lobby to hang out in.
I spent the better part of a week at this property.
We were working on an important project.
From the moment we walked in the door we felt welcomed and comfortable.
Of course, when you arrive at the mall, you're in the ladies lingerie dept.
