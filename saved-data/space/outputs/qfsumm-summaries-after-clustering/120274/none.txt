Yes there were some little black flies but if you got a lounger away from the hedge they didn't bother you and there certainly weren't any in our room.
We came into town to get an early start the next day at Disney.
What a nightmare!
Disgusting!
We slept 6 hours and left as quickly as possible.
Never again.
I would not stay here if it was free.
Stay away!
Yes I did see ants in the sink but I live in Spain & have ants in my kitchen cupboards so that didn't worry me as once they are in the walls they are hard to get rid of.
Hummm.
..what else good?
Guess that's it.
The bad..the AC unit ran for one minute and shut off for three...all night long.
The fan was set to high speed and couldn't be changed.
I won't be back.
If you stay here...it will be hit and miss.
And GLAD I did.
There were ants swarming around the sink by the bathroom and on the space heater, there were crickets coming out from under the bed, and when I lifted the mattress (to initally check for bed bugs) I found several small cockroaches.
And to top it all off, when I was talking to the night desk clerk about all the bugs in the room and that I would promptly be checking out, I felt something bite my ankles!
I was trying to get the red ants off my feet and ended up with bites on both ankles and my toes.
How grosse!
!
We had both Cockroaches and bedbugs in two seperate rooms.
!
All in all, though, we WILL consider coming back next time.
we are just back from our stay here booked through first choice.
Got a great deal off of expedia to stay here for 6 days.
Here is where my problem lies.
No alarm clock in the room.
Also when I went to the lobby to get quarters so I could have a cold drink he told me he didn't have any.
But they do give you free wi-fi, so that's something.
This is our 4th trip to Orlando in a row, and all other accomodations were top of the line, until we entered the Dark Zone.
We thought we had entered a third world country.
It cost us a one-night stay penalty to get out of it but it was well worth it.
Very limited tv channels, but the room is only used for sleeping... you have to visit the Theme Parks when in Orlando.
!
Firstly we could not find the hotel, we needed to go a bit further down on the 192 than we were doing but when we finally got we got checked in very quickly, be warned the reception staff are very rude and unhelpful!!
A car did get broken into when we were there so make sure you leave nothing on the seats.
This was just as good as any of them.
I was worried about my stay at this motel after reading reviews.
I was perfectly content with the selection.
The orange juiced was bad & watered down, but I only drank coffee which was good.
plastic cups, ice bucket.
I would definietly stay again.
I was a bit concerned given some of the comments from other reviewers, however given how much it was costing us (£20 a night) I was pleasantly surprised.
you dont buy the room you just stay there for a short while STOP moaning and enjoy your holiday its a GREAT hotel i will be going back again in 2011
a sign in room states free local calls.
To solve this problem we went to the supermarket across the road and paid two pounds for a polystyrene one, filled it with ice from the motel and away you go!!
I was worried when i read some of the reviews on here, but i didn't experience any of the problems mentioned on here.
There are drinks vending machines outside the rooms and there are washer/dryers too.
The gift shop is tiny but it does sell all the essentials and the guy in there is fantastic.
The only issue i had with the transfers were that they were overcrowded.
But it was free so cant complain!
All in all, it is a budget hotel, so as long as your not expecting valet parking and Caviar then you'll be fine!
Overall value for money and ok for ammount of time we spent at hotel eg: sleep and shower.
We had no problems.
Could watch disney fireworks from upper balconey.
No problem, come back tomorrow and you can change room.
Disregard all the negative reviews as you will always get moaning *************.
(watch for the aligators kids) Happy Holidays
I'm a single girl aged 28.
I had an amazing time!
I left yesterday and wish I could have stayed longer!
(I'm hoping next month- it was that good!)
I was so happy with my stay I wrote the hotel manager a note saying thank you.
I cannot wait to return!!!
!
Don't forget to go to "Old Town" about 5 miles down the road.
Believe me this is not a Hotel it is a Motel, the 2 1/2 Star rating is being generous it is not worthy of 1 star.
Would certainly stay there again.

We arrived.. obviously very excited about disney!
It was distcusting!
!
My papers and clothes also had a damp feeling to them.
My papers and clothes also had a damp feeling to them.
Bed was clean but there were small ants on the sink by the bathroom.
No ants, but still that same odor.
First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.

Please do yourself a favor, do not stay here.
Im only posting this because I don’t want you to make the same mistake we did, don’t waste your hard earned money here, you couldn’t ask me to come back and stay for free, please beware!!!
!
I originally thought not too bad.... boy was I wrong.
If you want to watch tv... forget it.
The best part was on the way home, I found a creepy crawly thing in my purse.
We checked out after 2 nights.
Its not worth it!!!
!
You sometimes wonder what you have spent your hard earned cash on when you read some of these reviews!!
A/C worked perfectly... and not so noisy either.
After all the debate before we arrived about how bad this place would be, turns out there was nothing to worry about.
so don't believe the negative hype and enjoy a modern day bargain!
!
There were LOTS of bugs in the rooms including ticks and spiders.
I was quite worried after reading the reviews, but as we got a really good deal stoppping there for 2 weeks, we thought if it is that bad we could always find somewhere else, luckly it was fine and stopped there for 2 weeks.
We did however see two little ants on the dresser which i squashed but never saw any again.
Yes there were love bugs but you get them everywhere in florida.
Overall we had a really good time and for the price we would stay here again.
Any questions please ask.
After terrible reviews i was afraid to walk in .
Oceola mall is a 30 minute bus ride , but NOT worth going.
Overall , i was VERY pleased with my experience.
There were molds on the toilet.
I couldn't trust some of the ticket sellers as they usually advertise that they buy "unused tickets", too risky in my opinion.
We met with the manager (Rocio) to discuss this bus situation but it did not solve anything.
My friend who stayed at the hotel with me got angry and started to raise her voice.
The manager did the same.
But that was because either the other families were foreigners and didn't know how to voice their complaints.
We did have however, ants around the sink that kept on popping out.
My main point is: The manager is absolutely rude and holds no responsibility in her job.
That itself, just ruined my whole hotel experience at Quality Inn Maingate West.
Having read some of the reviews I was not expecting much.
The return is 8.45pm and 10.15pm from the Ticket and Transportation centre and 10.05pm from Epcot, You can also use Lynx buses 55 and then 56 to get to and from Disney Ticket and Transportation centre.
If you are on a budget I would recommend this hotel.
Booked through First Choice and after reading some of the reviews I was fearing the worst, but on arrival I was pleasantly suprised.
Check in was a breeze.
6.30 - 9.30.
O.K.
Save your money, stay basic and give yourself more spending money for all those shopping malls.
My partner & I stayed here the first two weeks in May 2007 & after reading some reviews here I admit that I feared the worst......but upon arrival I was happy to see that most of it was over exaggerated.
The stuff you may have read about the flies is partly true but I think it's the time of year plus it's not as bad as it's made out to be.
How much time will you be in the hotel anyway???
We were hardly there as there's too much to do!!!!
Luckily we only stayed one night.
We had planned to stay for 6 days, however, we got robbed half an hour after check in.
The manager on duty was unfriendly and didn't even offer help, until he finally called the police.
THE UGLY....Unsafe exposed electrical wiring, Loud drunken kids on both weekends, No sercurity.
I read reviews of many of them before choosing this hotel.
We had the most terrible experience ever!!
There is ants in the sink, crawling all over, when I complained, they said we can give you a "cleaner" room tomorrow.
When we came back after a long day in Disney's, we found more ants in the new room, that wa"sprayed" PLUS a toilet that was had dry feces on the seat.
That was outrageous!!
We moved out after that incident, and did not get our money back for that night, as we did not comply to the policy on checking out prior to 11 am.
It was just a disater!
!, also Expedia did not help, we bought the package through them, and could not get a refund for the night we did stay.
We had a very nice stay.
But when we arrived after a long 4 hour drive from Miami we were pleasently supprised.
On arrival we checked in and they asked for $10 service charge for the 5 days.
That was it.
But these are our only minor points.
I would stay here again with out a thought.
Booked this hotel as part of a package through Hotwire.
Since Jan 02nd 2012 .
The Hotel are ok, base on the location are very convenient , but the hotel had a bugs were I stay, due to many people check in all the time , you dont know what they bring in, I had bad experience during my stay, ( 5 nights ) the last two night I got bite by the bedbugs !
Most of the review you read on the site are depend on the person base on their stays, AND depend what room you check in , they are many tourist check in some bring their bugs in too .
Over all rating for me are : Bad experience .
You pay what you get !
REMEMBER .
We just returned from a week's stay, and overall quite satisfied.
For the money we spent on the package (little), I was just happy to have a clean room, in a decent location and so was satisfied.
I stayed for a couple of nights in October 2011 prior to attending a conference at one of the Disney resorts.
Having done a lot of budget US motel travel in the past, this motel is little different from any of the other sub $50-a-night places that you can stay in across the USA.
People have mentioned bugs and other critters in previous reviews - I didn't get any bedbug bites, but I did have to evict a cockroach that I found crawling across a wall on the second night.
In fact we were able to see the fireworks at night from our front door.
We were there for three nights.
Nothing outstanding.
And you will want to cancel when you learn there are superior area hotels who match lower advertised rates.
We have just returned from a weeks holiday staying at the Quality Inn.
We were worried after reading the reviews.
was superb and not noisy.
We had breakfast every morning and although basic it was ok. We booked our Universal Studio tickets here and got a very good deal.
We got a great last minute deal with First Choice and to be honest we were expecting the worst but we were happy with everything.
The money we saved bought us lots of super things from the Malls and Outlets.
Would recommend to anyone.
For the money this hotel was great.
Look forward to returning.
stayed here for 14 nights.
check in took couple of minutes.
we saw an ant on the path outside our room do readers think we should complain i think some people expect 5 star for 2 star price we came with airtours on a late booking did all the tourist things and had a perfect time
For the price we paid for the Package (including Star Class Air travel & also a Hire car) we were pleasantly surprised at the quality afforded us here both the accommodation and definately the attention of ALL OF THE STAFF.
Excellent !!!!
WE INTEND TO RETURN THERE AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
It is good value for money although you have to pay a small amenities charge on top of your reservation cost.
We booked our stay based on our previous experience.
Our stay this time was pretty good again.
Not a big issue, but that shouldn't happen.
Got a very good deal for a 2 week holiday.
This was my family's 6th Florida holiday but this time we brought my parents along for their first trip.
I went on the internet and looked at the reviews of this hotel and there were several bad reviews which made us all a bit concerned but when we arrived we were all very surprised.
There were tiny ants on the counter around the sink area.
We were supposed to stay for 6 nights, but extended our stay to 9 nights.
- Cool birds (i think they were cranes) came to visit outside the hotel rooms every day!
My kids just couldn't wait to see how their stuffed animals would be tucked in by the staff .
We are planning to stay there again for sure and we can only highly recommand the Quality Inn Maingate West !!
!
I was quite nervous before our arrival at this hotel after reading some of these reviews.
Everything we requested we were able to have.
At that time I also requested a room on the third floor due to previous reviews on here.
We would definitely stay here again for the money that we spent.
Everything worked out really well for us.
People sitting outside on sidewalk or bringing it to there rooms.
Tiny bugs in the sink and on countertops, couldn't leave food lying around.
No place to lounge.
for two hours.
Well worth it $$$.
With AAA, I payed $55 a night which is a deal around there.
I typically stay at Hampton Inn but we were trying to do this on the cheap.
Everyone there is visiting Disney.
I checked for bugs including bed bugs.
I did not find any in the room.
Here are some tips to find them.
Lift the head board off the wall and look behind it.
this stuff kills bed bugs and leaves a nice cinnamon smell.
Tip on Disney.
yuck.
Have a great time and don't worry about staying here.
By the way in the cereal there were ants.
They do offer great deals on theme parks and car rentals.
I loved that it did include: free parking, pool, laundry facility, free wireless, and free shuttle.
Didn't think is was worth the complain so just kept it that way!
Booked through AARP senior travel and paid in advanced.
We left not not knowing if we would get a refund or not, didn't matter,,,,,,,,get the picture?
It was terrilble.
AARP did give us a refund for nights not used.
Bill / Tulsa, ok.
It was cleaned everyday, the safe was free (bonus) and the beds were the most comfortablist (?)
!
We went to the Quality Inn in June as part of a First Choice package holiday.
Unfortunately Florida was experiencing almost record rainfall levels resulting in us spending more time than would be expected at the hotel.
When it was brought to their attention the front desk people were very rude about the problem and the maintence man tried telling us they were "sugar ants" We were promised several different things just so we would not report them to the health department or write a review.
We did not receive anything from them except an awful time.
Also, the safe didn't work, but it didn't seem to have any power to it.
After 3 days they finally moved us to another room which smelled better, but woke up to find more ants in the bathroom we called the front desk again they blamed us on our sweets which we still had none and they came and sprayed walls, floors, shower and under and behind all furniture and finally on 4th day of our 7 day trip finally no ants .
Stayed here a couple of years ago but felt the need to post as noticed a few bad reveiews and i didnt think it fair not to post the good reviews!
Great for couples that need a base, not so much for families that have early nights with the kids.
We had a thoroughly pleasant stay and definately got what we paid for.
There was also a hair-dryer mounted on the wall.
I read a great many of the reviews of this motel before leaving the UK and wondered what had I booked!
I asked for this because in the many trips that I have been to in the US before they seem to expect that you will want a ground floor which is usually noisier.
The 192 roadway outside is not too noisy and certainly nothing like the noise levels at night that you would experience up at International Drive beside the I4.
As to complaints other reviewers had regarding crawling insects, maybe this occurs on lower levels and yet again it is a sub tropical area with loads of insects.
Overall it depends what you are looking for.
There is a self-service laundry machine on the ground floor at the hotel.
every morning.
the official opening hours, but I happened to arrive at the entrance there at about 9:30a.m.
or 10:00a.m.
I could not complain about it.
Despite expecting a dive from previous reviews, I was pleasantly surprised.
Ten minutes to disney avoided spoiling the day with a long drive home.
We could both feel the excess weight on arriving home, despite running from ride to ride at the theme parks each day!
I would definitely, go back, unless I won the lottery or got a serious payrise!
P.s.
Don't forget to go to adventure island next to universal.
the best theme park we visited!
Emma x
Overall - ok for our needs but would not suggest this hotel for more than a 7 day stay, or for anyone with a family or who would want any level of service above 2* - and DEFINATELY WOULD NOT VISIT IN HIGH SEASON.
HOPE THIS HELPS
!
When you spend as little as I did on a last minute flights and accomodation package, we weren't expecting a much more than a clean and safe place to sleep.
We were not disappointed!
