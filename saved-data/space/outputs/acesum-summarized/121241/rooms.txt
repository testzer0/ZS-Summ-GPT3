***** Sentences in Cluster ****
The Settle Inn was very kid friendly.
The suite was big enough for the kids to have space to play and not be on top of us.
The extended pool hours are great, you can swim before you start your day and after you return from sightseeing.
The beds were comfy and the sheets were soft, which is hard to find in some hotels.
We will definitley go back again.
this was a very nice motel has swimming pools hot tubs and arcade.
and there new beds are awsome they are very comfortable.
the room looks so relaxing when you walk in to it.
My wife and I stayed at the The Stone Castle Hotel & Conference Center (formerly the Settle Inn) for 2 nights, June 3 and 4.
As the hotel has just went thru an extensive remodel, we decided to give it a try and hope for the best (and glad we did!)
The room we stayed in on was very clean and the beds were more comfortable than our own at home.
An excellent breakfast buffet (coffee, orange juice, donuts, 2 large containers of scrambled eggs, same with biscuits and same with 2 sausage gravy containers…as one went close to empty, it was removed and refilled.
They had a Dining area person assigned who stayed right there all the time, not someone from the desk as happens in some places.
We ate a good breakfast both mornings, while being entertained by 2 great local performers, Denny Yeary and “Marshall” Tucker….boy could they sing!
NOTE: The Dining area had about 15 large round tables, with 8-10 chairs each…a lot of room and a lot of seating.
Between shows, we enjoyed an indoor pool and the hot tub.
The pool had a enough towels available so you did not have to use your ones from your room.
There is a pool in each of the two adjacent buildings.
(The main building has the dining area, the other two has the pools.)
we booked this hotel for the indoor swimming pool.
We traveled mid week so the hotel was on the quiet side.
We went and checked out the pool.
The pool room is very warm and it appeared we would be in there all by ourselves.
That is when we noticed the sign-no beverages or food allowed in pool room.
The hotel seemed fine otherwise.
Next time we hit Branson we will be sure to inquire about pool rules ahead of time.
We also prefer inside corridors.
We found the Stone Castle Hotel last weekend and loved it!
The beds were very comfortable.
On the downside, the rooms & common areas were quite outdated and in need of some repair.
Our room smelled damp or smelled of animal uran.
i requesded a room w/o the oder, they were more than ready to accomidate my repuest, and gave us a theam room for $50.00 a night more than we were paying.
We had a 3rd floor room, which was nice.
Opening the door, our room was musty and it smelled horrible.
The beds were comfortable and clean, the bathroom was very small but clean.
The beds were comfortable and clean, the bathroom was very small but clean.
The highlight of the hotel was the desk staff.
The room was clean too.
The bathroom door locks when you turn the lock left and then it locks again if you turn it very far to the right.
We had a balcony that had a door that wouldn't lock.
After a long hot day, sometimes you want to lay in a cool room and watch a little TV.
There was nothing in our rooms at all to help plan the trip.
We stayed one night in this hotel and moved to another for the remainder of our stay.
We had reservations for a double standard room.
When we arrived, they offered to bump us up to one of their theme rooms because they needed our room.
We had the "Pirates of the Carribean Room".
The breakfast was good and the breakfast entertainment was a nice touch.
We had an awesome stay at this hotel.
The rooms were very nice and beds slept awesome.
The hotel has more than one pool that is convenient.
The room was clean and the beds were good.
The breakfast was wonderful.
My group of 60+ ladies converge on the hotel for 4 days and nights and we kind of just take over the place!
I have to give a shout out for Mary Ann and Tammy, who make our dining experiences, which is 3 times a day for 4 days, absolutely amazing!
The group just raves over the super comfy beds and overall cleanliness of everything.
The room was neet, clean, and more than adequate for our needs.
The continental breakfast was wonderful and well organized.
breakfast?
The bathroom is so small & dirty you couldn't stand to touch anything in it.
The beds were very very nasty.
The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable.
We ate breakfast the first day and it was very good.
We enjoyed our stay here very much - did not like the wooden floors because early in the mornings, we could hear creaks as the people above us moved around.
The room was nice and well decorated.
Breakfast was on our floor and smelled the hallway up a little, so much so that we weren't interested in eating it.
They could definitely use some new bed linens, but the beds were nice and comfy and housekeeping was nice, too.
Not a four star hotel, but definitely not a bad place to stay!
My son enjoyed the indoor pool and game room.
Pool was VERY cold, though, so he couldn't stay in for very long periods of time.
As for the hotel itself, it is old and outdated.
The bathroom in my room was old.
We had the Jewel of the Nile it was very nice we loved it.
We went to the first pool room the hot tub was not hot at all it was very cold and it was blowing out cold water, the pool was alittle bit cold.
We then went to the 2nd pool room the hot tub was hot and the pool was still kinda cold.
Later on that night we went back to the 1st pool room the pool was warm and the hot tub was warm we pushed the bubble button it was still blowing out cold water.
The breakfast was very good.
My family stayed overnight the Stone Castle Hotel last week.
We have stayed here in the past so it is a familiar place and our children have fond memories staying here when they were toddlers.
On this particular stay, we had two rooms with two queen beds.
The rooms had adequate space and decorated with a medieval theme.
The breakfast buffet they provide has hot food (eggs, sausage, french toast sticks, biscuits and gravy) along with your typical hotel breakfast food.
There are two swimming pools and both were busy when we were there.
Each pool has a hot tub, but one was closed for maintenance.
The hallways and rooms could be lit brighter and it is an older hotel.
Overall, it was a nice clean place to stay.
I was in town for a function at the hotel, which is why i stayed there.
Its definitely an older hotel and seemed to be recently freshened up a bit.
The rooms were clean and had nice furnishings.
The free breakfast was not bad....and we had live entertainment as well.
But overall its a nice town and I had a nice stay at the hotel
This is definitely not a luxury hotel, but for the price, it's a great deal.
My husband especially liked the breakfast that was included.
Eggs, sausage, ham, biscuits and gravy plus hot and cold cereals were served.
The family and I stayed two nights at the newly renovated Stone Castle Hotel in Branson.
By request, we were placed in one of the three buildings that had a pool.
The room was very nice.
The beds were comfy and the a/c worked great.
Since it was so hot during our stay, in the 100's, the indoor pool was very inviting.
My oldest son and I spent a great amount of time in the pool.
When he wasn't in the pool, he was in the gameroom which is right next to the pool.
Breakfast consisted of waffles, donuts, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, and juice.
There were two ladies that set up the breakfast and they both were so nice each morning.
The best part of the breakfast was the live entertainment.
They are funny and have wonderful voices.
Loved the Settle Inn/Stone Castle.
We stayed in the 3rd building on the 2nd floor.
The beds were poorly made.
The bathroom is TINY!
My husband went to the front desk we thought maybe there was a issue with our card because we had paid cash before.
NAsty hotel!!!!
The breakfast was very bland and the music show wasn't that great either.
Will definately return when in the Branson area.
The room was very large and comfortable, clean, quiet, great location.
Full buffet breakfast was outstanding!
Two swimming pools for the kids.
I called the hotel before I booked it, making sure I could get a room with wi-fi and pet free, they said no problem.
We got to the room, looked good, nice furnishings.
I then took my laptop to the front desk.
Went back to my room, nothing.
I went back down to front desk.
They offered us another room, I went up to the new room with my laptop to verify it worked, That room had some sort of problem above the a/c unit that looked like it had water damage.
I went back down to front desk, was given a third room to try.
I went back upstairs, wi-fi worked, room looked ok.
We then moved all of our stuff to this 3rd room.
In summary, I would not stay here again, I would have chosen The Radisson.
We LOVED it here!
They have onsite laundry and SEVERAL pools.
It's a great place to stay when you come to Branson.
This hotel was probably great at one time.
The pool area was in terrible shape.
Too many more hotels in Branson to stay here again.
Are rooms were close together, very family friendly Hotel.The beds were very comfortable.
Rooms and halls were clean and neat.
The breakfast experience was GREAT, the live music show was fun and entertaining.
The hot tubs and pool areas were very nice.
We are looking forward to our next visit to Stone Castle.
Upon pulling up to the hotel I was pleased with the appearance, that is where my pleasure ended!
We headed to the pool.....yuck!
The pool was VERY cold!
Pulled the blankets back on the bed was surprised to see there was a duvet that nobody uses because you know they don't wash them, the middle blanket was all ripped (on both beds), the sheets looked like they needed washed, anytime you move at all the bed continues to bounce for a while after.
We booked a regular king room for 5 nites and left after the 2d nite.
The hotel is overall alright and the theme rooms or suites may be roomier but the regular rooms are very cramped.
we had a king bed which was pretty comfortable .
you could barely sqeeze between the foot of the bed and the armoir.
the bathroom was very small with a tub/shower and comode.
The hotel had some nice decor and was probably v ery nice when it was newer, but needs to be updated and new carpet.
The breakfast was very good and there was lots of room for every\one to sit and eat.
they had some pretty good entertainment each morning for breakfast.
We got good rates on our room because they sent us a coupon by email and if you don't mind being cramped, it was a good bargain.
We just wanted more room and a bed with a pillow top mattress.
We won't stay here again unless they offer the theme rooms and suites at a fair price.
The Settle Inn has three separate buildings and we were given a room in the oldest of the three.
The hotel needs updating and cleaning.
The room had one double bed and was extremely small.
The smallness was accentuated by the large armoire, which made the room seem even smaller.
You could barely walk between the armoire and the bed.
The bathroom was extremely small, with an older bath/shower and toilet.
The room smelled musty.
The Settle Inn was nice about switching us to a larger room with two double beds.
The continental breakfast is served only in the first of the three buildings, which meant walking a distance.
We found this delightful hotel called The Stone Castle (formerly known as Settle Inn).
It's right off the main drag and strikingly nestled into the Ozark hillside.
It's a lovely facility that gives off a castle-like feeling, complete with medieval knight right there at the entrance to greet you.
The room was quite comfortable and affordable.
Our package included Belgian waffles and biscuits and gravy the next morning with a breathtaking view out the widespread windows in the dining room of the Ozark mountains on a crisp sunny morning.
This place was just great - perfect for smaller kids.
The Stone Castle will surely be our hotel of choice every time we visit Branson.
Glad I found it!!
Then she discovers that they made a mistake and reserved one room for the 26-30.
At this stage they said they only had another room with a single queen available and it was in a different building than the other room.
I had to cancel the rooms and then frantically search for another Hotel with an indoor pool in Branson on a Friday night.
It was a complete nightmare after a long drive.
Thank goodness we found The Cascade Motel and they had a family suite for us and a far Superior place to stay for about the same price.
Our room was fine except a little dark.
The room was nice and clean and for the price it was better than expected for us.
The staff was great but the breakfast was not so great but is was good enough.
Swimming area was clean and fun and everything you want to see is near this hotel.
Hotel had a great breakfast.
The jets on the hot tub were broken and sprayed water in your face if you tried to use them, one pool was ice cold while the other was fine.
The Settle Inn Branson was an excellent choice.
We have stayed at this location on two other occassions and plan to return in the next time we go to Branson.
2d time to stay at this hotel.
2, count 'em 2, separate indoor pools and hot tubs!
No worry about pools full of kids.
Rooms are fine, nothing fancy.
Beds could be softer.
The hotel is nice from the exterior.
Typical Branson - if you're expecting an W Hotel, Vegas-esq spread, or even a nice Marriott Renaissance - you might keep looking.
However, it's neat and tidy.
It's a bit dated, but clean.
The owners are in the process of updating rooms, so I think this is a known issue.
However, the room was very acceptable, as were the common area and the pools.
Breakfast was good and the usual hot items.
The first thing I noticed is the hallways were very dark even in daytime.
My room was very small, again very poor lighting.
The bathroom door hits the toilet when you close it.
The hotel said no other rooms were available to switch and a locksmith was not available to fix the locks.
Cold breakfast!
the hotel was very artistic, the workmanship of the building was just beautiful, i think it was the largest hotel in Branson.
wonderful in door pool and hot tub/spa.
great complimentary breakfast.
our lodging experience at the settle inn was just great, i would recommend this hotel to everyone.
Pluses: Good service, inexpensive, friendly, everything works, nice bath fixtures Negatives: the continental breakfast is kind of sad, but the hot breakfast isn't any better.
The hotel was very pleasant.
The beds were comfortable and a good size.
Stayed 2 nights, room was very small and was damp and musty.
The room was like being in a cave with a bad smell.
We stayed at this place for 5 awful nights for a conference.
Free breakfast; that's using the term breakfast loosely.
The rooms were dirty, small and the t.v.
was tiny, though housed in a large armoire.
One good thing about the place was the bed.
It is the hotel we always stay at.
There are a couple of nice restaurants or fast food joints very near, along with a couple of mini-golf courses.
The rooms are always very clean and have a coffee pot, blow dryer, and cable tv.
There are a couple of swimming pools and hot tubs available that are open early in the morning to very late at night.
In the morning you can enjoy a free breakfast with many choices.
It is no wonder The Stone Castle is the only place I want to stay when I am in Branson!
The room was beautiful and the beds were some of the most comfortable beds I had ever slept in.
My teenage boy and girl were with us and really enjoyed the pools and the hot tubs.
I give this Hotel the highest available.
We also got a reduced rate through another booking event, but I was already intrigued with the idea of the themed rooms.
We stayed in the one with the stone arch and all the knight themes.
Yes, it was an older hotel and room, and it did have a slight musty smell, but the charm overwhelmed everything.
There were all sorts of artifacts in the room from helmets to weapons and the waterfall jacuzzi was the most spectacular and ingenious piece.
It was a comfortable room but was not very clean.
Very dark rooms and could hear every sound from the room next to us.
Breakfast was ok but poorly stocked, there were only ~10 rooms rented while we were there so no excuse for overcrowded.
This is just an older hotel that they have tried to fixed up but too many tale tale signs of aging.
We stayed in one of the regular rooms and toured the themed rooms ($50.00) more a night, I'm glad we did not pay extra for a room that was the same as ours except for murals on the walls and an old whirlpool tub, would never recommend a themed room.
If you get the room free like we did I guess it would be worth it, I'm glad we did not pay for it (time share presentation).
My wife and I stayed at The Stone Castle Hotel & Conference Center in Branson, MO from Wednesday thru Sunday and had a very good time.
The breakfast in the mornings was very good.
They also have family suites that are great.
This is a sprawling place but it is beginning to show its age.
The room was clean but worn the AC/Heat was very noisy and the towels really needed to be replaced.
Stone Castle is very convenient to the main strip in Branson, but is also accessible to the relief routes that avoid traffic The rooms were very clean and the beds were super comfortable.
The free breakfast buffet in the morning was delicious and had a good variety.
I highly doubt there is a better room for the price in Branson!
at the stone castle hotel it is highly a must to see and stay at,from its three castles and two indoor heated pools and two spas it also is equipt with a family arcade,gift shop,laundry and a hot deliciuos breakfast each morning and if thats not enough it also has for your convience high speed internet and a computer for your use in the lobby.the rooms are newly remolded with pillow top beds,table and chairs,restroom etc needs,ironing board and iron,and a blow dryer.the tvs are meduim size and cable tv.this hotel is right smack in the heart of branson.
We arrived in July 2011 and the following concerns the motel.
First of all I will say the good thing as the bed was comfortable and clean.
Overall, I would not stay at this motel again for the price.
The bathrooms were so small you had to stand behind the door to close it.
I don't mind paying more money for a nice place to stay but when the motel is in the shape of the Stone Castle Motel, I would not reccommend it to anyone.
I give this motel one star.
The rooms are very clean and have plenty of room with the most comfortable beds for a good night's sleep.
The rooms are very clean and have plenty of room with the most comfortable beds for a good night's sleep.
They have a wonderful breakfast buffet with entertainment in the mornings (at no extra cost).
When away from home, the most important thing for us is having a comfortable bed to sleep in and to have the comforts of home.
Check in process was very pleasant, room was nice and CLEAN!!
We have stayed there before and loved it every time.
They have an excellent continental breakfast.
Pillows were even good, which is usually not the case at most hotels (from some of my previous experiences at other hotels).
Will definitely reserve there when I visit Branson anytime.
The positive things about the hotel: Pretty landscaping, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are cool - air conditioner works well, the eating area for the continental breakfast is very large and roomy, great location - walking distance to many attractions and quiet area.
The rooms are decorated nicely and the hotel manager is energetic.
Next, the first room that was assigned to us smelled like moth balls, we were given another room which was much better.
The rooms seem small, tight fit for a family of 4.
The pools were very cloudy, could not see the bottom of the pool (which is not deep).
There are better hotels for the money, but this one has potential.
It's in a very quiet part of Branson, the rooms are super clean, the staff is very helpful and they have a great hot breakfast.
This will be the place we stay, from now on, when we go to Branson.
We stayed this last week for 2 days while we were in Branson.
I have to say that I did pretty good on this hotel.
It was the best one we stayed on our trip.
The breakfast was excellent.
The room was nice and clean and the hotel staff was wonderful.
The room was nice and clean and the hotel staff was wonderful.
This is our home away from home.
We absolutely love this place!
We stay here everytime we come to Branson.
Centrally located right off "the main strip," The Stone Castle offers convenience, luxury, and a cozy atmosphere for the entire family.
All rooms are clean and nonsmoking.
While the mom shops till she drops, the little girls and I always enjoy the huge indoor pool and hot tub no matter what the seasons brings outside.
We highly recommend this place to anyone who has children or to the couple who wants to rekindle the fire in their marriage.
Their hot breakfast was included and was excellent with eggs, sauage, biscuits and gravey, and french toast as well as cereal and youart.
Not a typical contenintal breakfast.
Rooms are clean, and the staff helped me do what I needed to.
Stayed five nights--checked out this morning, April 27, 2012.
Room was priced right.
Bathroom was tiny.
Beds were heavenly!
Most of the events, exhibits, shows, and restaurants were just a short ride from the hotel.
Out of 7 pillows all but one was stained and even Josh the young man who brought us the pillows and sheet said he would let the GM know about the status of these nasty pillows!
Well room 506 was not clean and the hallway stunk and as we entered into the room the floor was wet from the sink leaking.
One of the pillows I checked just before my 8 year old daughter was about to put her head down on it and it appeared to be molded.
This hotel was very comfortable, with a full buffet breakfast.
Other reviews state that the rooms are small, but I found they were just a little more narrow than other properties.
The room smelled musty when we first walked in.
We asked for another room.
Hotel needs updating.
Rooms are dark and dingy (black carpet?)
You literally had to turn around to get into the bathroom.
We wanted to upgrade to a larger room, but only standard rooms are pet friendly.
With all the choices in Branson, we would not stay here again.
We have stayed at the Stone Castle Hotel twice now and have been very pleased both times.
The rooms are nice and the location is close enough to access everything we want to do in Branson, but off the strip so we can get to it quickly.
The pool and hot tub are open until 1 am which worked great for us when we got in late.
The kids love the big breakfast with eggs, waffles, b&g, donuts, etc.
and we were lucky enough to see a breakfast show during one of our stays.
When my wife and I were trying to find a hotel to stay in for a weekend family vacation, we came across this hotel.
All the way during the drive, we both joked that we'd booked a stay at a dump, but once we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find an actual hotel, with actual people.
When we saw our room, our smiles deepened.
Very warm, cozy, and comfortable rooms.
Breakfast was warm and fresh, the people were all very friendly.
And truthfully, we can't wait to get back to our new hidden gem!
We stayed in the Settle Inn (now Stone Castle Hotel and Conference Center) for a family reunion in July.
We stayed in a room which I assume was supposed to be a suite, however it was really just adjoining rooms.
One room was very warm.
Unfortunately, my husband and I were stuck in the warmer room.
However, the rooms were clean enough, breakfast was fairly good and we enjoyed the location off the main strip.
All in all...just okay.
Hotel was an excellent choice for our stay.
Rooms were great, staff was very friendly and helpful.
The first time the hot tub was a little dirty and the breakfast not so great.
By our 2nd trip only a few weeks later they have added a full breakfast and the pools and hot tubs were clean!
I have been going to branson at least 3 times a year since I was 7 and this is one of the best places we have stayed!
Everything was great---Front desk people were friendly and was always willing to help in anyway...Rooms were clean and fresh..Breakfast was good and good music to listen too....I would rate this hotel and one of the best Branson has to offer.
The beds were very comfortable.
On the downside, the rooms & common areas were quite outdated and in need of some repair.
Our room smelled damp and mildewy and the carpet felt damp.
The indoor pool/jacuzzi could really use some updating, ventilation, and bigger towels, but water was clean.
We enjoyed our stay at the Settle Inn/Stone Castle in Branson, MO.
The room was nicely appointed, clean, and the bed was very comfortable.
It was great having breakfast on site.
We will make use of it again, I am sure.
The rooms are always nice and clean and the location is nice since it sits right on the Yellow Route.
Since our first stay here we have never looked at any other hotel.
This is our third stay at the Stone Castle.
The rooms are very reasonable, clean and relaxing.
The breakfast is great and the pool and hot-tub an added plus.
We spent one night in this hotel because we needed an extra night in Branson at the last minute.
There are no connecting rooms at this hotel which I specifically asked for when I made the reservation and was not told they just didn't have them.
The bathroom was seriously smaller than any cruise ship bathroom that I have ever been in.
You had to sit sideways on the toilet just to close the door and when you did sit on the toilet the "right" way, the toilet paper holder was poking you in the side.
The outside does look pretty nice but the rooms inside do not.
Also, neither of the pools were working while we were there.
The rooms were clean, bathroom is extremely small and crowded, barely enough room to turn around.
Pools were clean but old looking.
Breakfast was pretty good, good entertainment with breakfast.
Downfall no mini fridge or microwave.
My husband and I really enjoyed staying at the Stone Castle Hotel.
We stayed in a standard room with a king bed.
The room was very clean and decorated very nicely.
There was all the standards for a nice hotel room, there was even a coffee maker.
The standard rooms are cramped with very poor lighting.
I'm sure a suite would have been much better, but I didn't want to pay the extra amount.
The room was a great value.
My room was dusty, which made me think that maybe it wasn't too clean.
However, if you're going to Branson to see Branson, this is a perfectly adequate hotel.
This hotel met and surpassed our expectations.
The rooms were average hotel size but very nice.
The beds not your average "hotel" beds.
(I dont go on vacation to sit in the hotel and watch TV) The rooms were very clean.
(Expecially the bathroom).
They offered breakfast and it was much more than your average cereal and donuts.
The room they serve it in is huge.
There was always enough seating.
You can not go wrong with this hotel!
We have stayed in several hotels in Branson but this is one that we would definatly return to.
The hotel in all is very clean and the standard rooms are very spacious.
The free breakfast was very good and they have entertainment while you eat.
We had family come back to the hotel and we sat out side at the gazzebo then moved in to one of the sitting rooms on the second floor..
Overall, our group was very pleased with the hotel.
We booked three rooms, and we were all right in the same area.
Breakfast was very good; I am a relatively picky eater and I don't understand why other reviews complain about the breakfast, especially given the cost of this hotel.
The breakfast show on both days was great if you like country music, but a bit on the loud side.
The rooms were very clean, but ours did have a bit of a musty smell that went away after we turned on the air.
The rooms are on the small side, but that didn't matter to us as we weren't in there very much.
The beds were fine, and the decor was very nice.
The bathroom was very, very tiny.
When you opened the door it came within one inch or so of the toilet, but again, that was not a problem for us, just something to be aware of.
Overall, we were very pleased with our stay at the Stone Castle and would definitely stay there again, especiall for the great rate that we got!
At first when I saw this big, magnificent hoteI that looked like a castle I thought that it would be way too much to stay there.
My Son was very young at the time and wanted to stay there as he liked knights and horses and they have statues of them at the entrance and inside the building, We decided to humor ourselves and stop by and see how much a room would be and we found that it was quite affordable and had many extras to offer.
They give a nice brakfast, sometimes with entertainment and a pool and hot tub that is open from 6 am to 1 am.
We have also rented a theme room and that was really fun.
The Settle Inn will only enhance your vacation and I think it will become your family's favorite place to stay too,
My husband and I had a room reserved at Settle Inn for a 3 night stay through a vacation package offer.
We requested a king sized bed which they said they would do, but upon arrival, we were told none were available.
We were told they only had 8 king sized beds total and they were all taken.
Then when we got to the room it was so small, and the bathroom had MOLD growing around the tile area.
I called the front desk and was told the maid would come clean the room plus it had a musty smell.
The room was filthy and disgusting!
My advice is to STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOTEL!
We were so plesed with the outside look of the hotel and just as plesed with our rooms.
They were clean and the furnishing were very nice.
The pools were very clean and the breakfast was great.
The pools were very clean and the breakfast was great.
We plan on staying in this hotel on our next trip to Branson.
The room was too small for four adults.
Pictures on the internet showed better rooms.
The bathroom was so small you could barely shut the door and turn around to shower, etc.
I would never stay there again, nor recommend it to anyone.
We were drawn to the stone castle hotel for the indoor pool for our weekend get a way.
A very nice room, lovely decorations, and amazingly comfortable beds.
The pool area was clean and comfortable with a nice hot tub as well.
We will deffinatly stay here again soon.
this is the best hotel i have ever stayed in.
the rooms are so clean.
the beds are so fresh and smell good.so close to sleeping in my own beds.
the bathrooms are so clean.
and i love that you have everything in the room you need.
the indoor pools .... wow.
the breakfast is grand.
This hotel is outdated.
The rooms are very poorly lit.
The bathrooms are minute.
The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable, the staff was professional and friendly and the conference rooms were perfect for our group.
A good hot breakfast was included and the hotel was convenient to other Branson attractions.
We go to Branson at least 3 times a year and we have stayed at many of the hotels and this one had the most comfortable beds and a great hot breakfast.
We have stayed in area hotels in the past but now prefer to stay at Stone Castle.
The rooms are well maintained, clean, and spacious.
We had a first floor room close to the pool area during our last stay.
The breakfast is great!
My husband, two boys, and I stayed at the Stone Castle and loved it!
We were very tired and decided to find a place close by the strip instead of venturing out to find a nice little cabin.
We stayed in a family suite that had three beds!
The rooms were neat, clean, and roomy!
We had a fridge, ironing board, and even two televisions...no fighting over the show to watch at night.
The price was unbeatable, the staff was helpful, and the breakfast (Which was included) was fantastic!
We have found the best place in Branson to stay every year!
3) Rooms so small- my bathroom at home was bigger than the whole room.
Stay away at all costs.
Stayed at the Stone Castle Hotel for a Silver Dollar City getaway.
Our room was clean as well as the hallways.
We had a standard room but they do offer theme suites.
Beds were comfortable and breakfast is included.
Beds were comfortable and breakfast is included.
The breakfast offered cereal, doughnuts, toast, eggs, biscuits and gravy, fresh waffles, fruit, juices, milk and coffee.
They even have entertainment during breakfast.
I highly recommend Stone Castle Hotel.
The price was right and our room was first class.
The only bad thing I have to say is my Wife loved the bed in our room and now that we are back home (St. Louis, MO), it looks like I will be buying a new bed.
The breakfast (free & hot) was perfect and the staff was very accommodating.
Our stay at the Settle Inn newly renamed to Stone Castle Hotel & Conference Center was great.
Our room was clean, functional and quiet.
We have 2 young boys and they loved the swimming pools (both of them).
We had a regular room and not a suite and found that we had adiquate room for the 4 of us.
Breakfast was good and always had a good selection.
This was our 3rd stay at the Stone Castle Hotel.
Nothing fancy, just a good clean place to stay.
It has 2 swimming pools, which was good because if one was really full, the other one usually wasn't.
Our room was clean.
The bathroom was squeeky clean.
Breakfast was good and the breakfast room was very clean.
We'll definitely stay here again.
Rooms were nice in decor but there was dirt under the beds, TV was tiny, wireless internet was horrible, room was very small, pool and hot tub were tiny and full of rowdy kids with no one enforcing the rules of no jumping or horseplay, could not enjoy it at all.
"DELUXE" continental breakfast was not bad if you could get near it, crowd were backed up across the parking lot and we finally gave up and went elsewhere.
Great indoor pools-not crowded at all.
Beds agreeable not too firm and not too soft.
We come to Branson a lot and have stayed in several hotels like Clairion and Comfort Inn.
We like this one best.
Good breakfast and a/c good.
