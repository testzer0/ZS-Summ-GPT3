For my next visit to Toronto I would hope to be able to stay at the Primrose again.
Drop off point for luggage check in is pretty small so if anyone is in front of you good luck accessing the hotel front door.
The laundry left something to be desired.
A pillow case had a blood stain on it(I think!
), and the the bath towels had yellow stains and smelled "funky"!
It did have nice white towels and a good selection of toiletries.
Â The carpet wasn't as well vacuumed as one would expect with the corners and edges not done for a while.
We didnâ€™t run into any problems at the hotel, but unfortunately our trip ended on a sour note as my wifeâ€™s wallet was pickpocketed while we were outside the CN Tower.
It could have been febreezed, at least.
The Wi-Fi service in the room was undependable, the 40+ kgb reception would suddenly drop to 1Kgb and unuseable, then it would flip up to perhaps 18 kbs and back to 1 kgb.

We have never been to Canada before or to a huge city like Toronto, we found it very easy to get around, Primrose hotel is an excellent location as the subway is only 5min walk way .There is a lot of restaurants , bars, stores ,drugmarts and shops within walking distance also Dundas sq , Eaton centre &hockey Hall of Fame are close by.
When I checked in I didn't see anything that put me off that much?

Everything on our bill was as it should be and the checkout went smoothly.

Played Hotwire roulette and thought that we lost when we were assigned to the Best Western.
This hotel was not bad at all, check-in was very quick.
This is sometimes how hotwire works, so we understand that.
Sure enough, when we returned to Ottawa, a Google search revealed that they indeed they had bedbug problems years ago!!!

When you turn it down and gradually goes up and if you can sleep only when it's a cool temperature you are going to have to wake up in the middle of the night to turn down the thermostat again.
Even housekeeping spoke to us in a morning and passed the time of day.
