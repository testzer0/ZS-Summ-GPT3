Aprox.
Late check in was effortless and was greeted with a warmed cookie.
Downtown Seattle was about a 30 minute ride by light rail service (cost of $16 for the 4 of us) or $40 cab ride to the pier.

I had such a great experience the first time, I am disappointed-and-as a single female traveler, will never stay on the ground floor of any hotel again, if at all possible.
The Drivers are very professional, courteous and make you feel like you are their only customer!
The quality of customer service should be an inservice for a number of their competitors.
My friend and I are both Hilton Honors members.
Just doesn't make sense.
After reading the reviews here, my family was VERY disappointed with the hotel.
All the other lodging options seemed to have dimly lit parking lots next to seedy businesses or something.
Even where renovated, the hotel still needs work.
The views of the airplanes taking off was great!
this hotel was so comfortable.
They never seem to slap my hand if I grab 2 or 3...recommendation goes to this hotel over others!
On a recent trip, we landed at Seatac after midnight and were picked up within five minutes.
Despite its proximity to the airport, the room was surprisingly quiet.
Spent 3 nights at conference at the hotel.
The first night there I did not hear any airport noise, but the second night, I clearly heard the planes.
At $65 plus the upgrade this was outstanding value, so much so we used it on our return journey too.
Stayed here after New Year's day and following day since we had tix to Seahawks game 01/02/11.

Parking and some extras relatively expensive.
It may cost a little more to stay here, but we feel it is worth it for the quiet rooms and the very comfortable beds.
I heard no noise from the airport, or elsewhere.
They have a good stay/fly program that we always use to leave our car there while on vacation.

Flat screen TV with many stations available.
There are also complimentary computers to use also.

I did make sure to include all the positive I had to say as well.
There is no way that they aren't banking money here.
Used the park and fly package.
Check out was quick.
Return to the hotel was fine.

Just be advised, this is a big conference service type hotel and they have many groups that use it....might not always be a quiet hotel, but for our trip it worked out great.
We did not choose it.
Received a great deal on this hotel by bidding on Priceline.
Maybe I got the cheap seats being a priceline customer.
Anyway, I requested a non-smoking room but the floor smelled like the stench of smoke.
I just wish the smokers had their own wing.
The stay, park & fly packages are *usually* a good deal, and their airport shuttle service is fantastic - I believe it runs every 20 mins around the clock.
This hotel is on a par in terms of service and room quality.
Considering over a hundred people turned up at the same time due to the cancelled flight the check in was very quick.
A few more signs halfway down corridors would have helped.
We got lost as did lots of people we met along the way!
Don't let this put you off though.
Overall it was still a reasonable deal though.
I would stay again.

The cons for me aren't a huge issue since I'm just overnighting it, but would be more significant for a prolonged stay.
I didn't expect much, but some things were better than average.
One thing to think about- this hotel is used by a lot of conventions.
When we were there, there were a bunch of real estate agents who were getting a bit rowdy.
We couldn't hear them in our room (thankfully), but they were pretty loud throughout the hotel.
It looks from other reviews here like you may be able to do better on Priceline if you don't want your Hilton points.
From reading others reviews I was not in the main towers, and only complaint was only being on the second floor someone was above me and from the sound they made walking must have weighed 400 pounds as it was very loud.
The two sinks were nice (one in the bath portion and one by the closet) that would be a nice feature if traveling with your spouse or children.
While the wing I was in appeared to be older, you could tell they try to take care of it and it was very clean.

other bugs every where.
On check in, the warm chocolate chip cookies were a lovely touch.
I can not say I slept well, but I think that was due to nerves and excitement about our pending vacation.
I was also woken by the cries of a baby in a nearby room.
The most disturbing noises came not from the jet planes across the street, but from the hallway.
If traveling with children, there is oodles of space to set up a portable crib.
Overall, a great stay.
I had a quick stay here last week for one night.
My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting.
I believe there are better options in walking distance from the hotel.
I stayed here for a week in June, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
I'm surprised at the negative reviews, I'm a regular Priceline customer, staying at the Doubletree usually once a month and have never had a bad experience.
(Yet they gave me two queens)
They were not too thrilled when we wanted to borrow their cart.
The inner hall was quiet but there was a lot of traffic noise from the outside.
The bed was comfortable but between the noise of the traffic ( not the jets) and the room fan, we did not sleep well.
We would not stay here again because of the noise and mildew.

Wonderfully quiet, considering the airport is literally across the street.
Big mistake.
It is just not worth the money.
We experienced this poor attitude with a few other staff members within the hotel.
Well, not quite.
The hotel is divided into different wings.
The crappy wings are old and the rooms smell musty.
( Liekthe Brady bunch!).

I got a good night sleep.
Like many before us, we stayed here before heading out to somewhere else the next day.
All in all a fine stay.

but had some issues too.

Maxi's, is a club to the top of the hotel.
Heard it was great, but didn't check it out, as we had our daughter with us.
All good!
What a great place.
You cannot beat this for families.
Check in and check out was easy and fast.
You go up stairs, down the elevator and thorugh doors.
Odd but we made it.
Expecting the Doubletree name to be better quality.
I absolutely loved the warm cookies we were given at check in and the beds in our room were so incredibly soft.
