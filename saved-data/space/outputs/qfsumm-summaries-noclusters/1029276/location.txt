Aspect: location
***** Model produced summary *****
Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler . This hotel was booked for us through our travel agent - it was near the airport & near the port of Miami where we were leaving on a cruise . Rate are cheap , but breakfast was not included and hotel charges $ 20 for breakfast buffet .
***** Golden Review 1 *****
This hotel has a very good location near the Biscayne Bay with beautiful views! It's very close to the Bayside area, and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach. There were always taxi's at the hotel. There was a lot of construction around the hotel, but overall it was relaxing for downtown location.

***** Golden Review 3 *****
The location was good, not right in South Beach, but was very close to the Bayside area and near the Biscayne Bay with beautiful views! There were always taxi's at the hotel also that could bring us on a five minute trip to the beach!!
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet!
And it is a very lovely place.
Excursions booked via hotel consierge could only be paid for with cash.
That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
When were assigned a new room the keys didn't work so we had to go back to have them activated.
This was an expensive option, but it was convenient since neither of us in the party was familiar with Miami.
One of the downsides to this motel is the location.
There is a Checkers and a Burger king across the street.
The hotel restaurant was adequate; however, the staff here also strived to please.
The view of the bay was incredible, and my bed was very comfortable.
As we had a car ,the location was not a problem.South Beach is just a short drive across the bridge and we took a taxi to Bayside.We ordered room service for breakfast and it was excellent.
A beautiful place!!
You don't generally go wrong with a Hilton.
The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace.
One other note..the restaurant in the hotel is nice but the waiters are drenched in cologne so that is all you smell and taste.
Being downtown the hotel is a bit lacking in local amenities.
Bayside Plaza is a short taxi ride away which is a lot of fun especially on Super Bowl week end and the Metromover is just a block away which gives access to Metrorail.
The restaurant inside the hotel had delicious plates and the breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and delicious.
The hotel is a three minute walk to the Metromover which will take you to Bayside in a couple of minutes where there is nightlife, shops, drinks, and restaurants.
Relaxing versus the 24 hour party going on at South Beach (though that was great as well).
I thought I would be staying downtown but this hotel is about 1 1/2 miles north of the downtown center.
Some tips: The parking is very expensive - $35 for valet and $25 for self-park.
After paying the first night, i parked on 17th Terrace north of hotel the second night for free.
Valet parking was over $25.
If you have a car, you have choice of vallet parking or self parking.
But other than that, not a bad place to stay.
I also told the front desk manager Christopher that it was a special trip as both my daughters had birthdays.
Everything was pretty close and accessible from the hotel (Bayside, South Beach, Coconut Grove etc.)
Hotel was ideally located for the purpose of my business trip.
I did not like the area the hotel was in i would of prefered south beach area.
Although the hotel was only a taxi drive away from south beach.
Hotel was convenient to and from Miami airport via SuperShuttle ($16 to and from here) and to cruise ship at nearby port.
So even though there was a mix up with my bag which caused me some frustration and sleeplessness, the Hilton more than made up for it.
Nearby Bin 18 is a wonderful restaurant, and was recommended by the concierge (David, who was also very helpful and nice).
Looks like the projects are just a few blocks away from the hotel and these folks come at you over and over.
Booked AAA Stay and Park.
Fantastic view from 19th floor.
Beautiful common areas, lounge, lobby, pool.
Will always return to Hilton if in Miami.
Car rental agency at location a plus.
Location is a little awkward to enter due to road construction.
2 sets of elevators and 2nd floor lobby layout is confusing at first.
High parking rates unless you get park & stay AAA rate (I did).
Good restaurant.
Good Chinese restaurant in Doubletree next door.
We stayed here for 2 days before our cruise out of Miami.
The view was amazing.
Stayed the night prior to our cruise, was a $15 taxi ride to the airport the next day.
as a side not they had $2 beers in the bar which was quite nice
It is in downtown Miami, so it makes sales calls very convenient for me.
The only complaint I have is the required $28 per day for parking, but this is Miami and any decent place will charge you for parking.
I travel about every week for business and stay in the Hilton/Hilton chain for the points and usually my stays are fine there.
Even though we booked on a discount site, we felt like important guests.
The view was inrcedible.
It is in downtown so you have to cab or drive to Miami beach but you know that upon reservation.
10.00 after the tip.
You are in Miami.
Get out and see the beach and the nitelife!!!!
They seem to have no idea how to run a bar.
I also did not care for the $28/ day parking fee.
Im confident that given more time I could have found something more pleasing for the second half of our family vacation.
Our stay at the Hilton Downtown Miami was nothing short of perfect.
The hotel is close to everything.
The hotel is near the ski train that will take you right downtown for free.
Not a terrible place, but I have to say that I've stayed in nicer places that are less expensive.
I'd suggest Hilton put a few dollars into a rehab.
On-site restaurant was simply okay, surrounding neighborhood was very blah, and the staff was ambivalent.
Finally, despite the name, it's not really downtown per se, but a 5 minute drive from downtown.
Unless you have a rental car, you're at the mercy of taxis to find an interesting neighborhood since this one is so bland.
Ask bayview and as high as possibele !
We has a great view over the bay (room 1416) The room was clean, large with a very comfortable bed.
We did valid parking (max 28 dollar a day), no problem checking in and out, they are fast.
The location,down -town, was oke.
Things looked not so nice a few blocks further away, so we did not walked around the area.
South beach is a 15 minutes drive.
We also did some beaching on Key Biscane, loved it.
The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun.
Great meeting space adn overall a well managed Hilton.
After staying in Hilton's in Alabama and other states i was expecting more from the Hilton in Miami.
The only downfall is that the hotel could have been in a better area.
All was fresh & clean, and the view of the bay was an added perk.
Hotel location is away from the main tourist attractions (Bayside Marketplace, Miami beaches).
There are hardly any shops nearby except for a fast-food outlet opposite the hotel.
Although - taking a tip from a previous poster - dine at the Bistro - 1/2 price on some of the appetizers and reasonably priced sandwiches.
BE WARNED though - self-park is 25 per day in the garage (or pay everytime you pull it out of the garage); valet park is 28 per day (can pull it out as often as you want).
I was here for one night with my family before we board a cruise ship across the bay.
Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs.
My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!
We also wanted to go out for dinner(the snacks in the lounge weren't enough for the kids)so he recommended a very good restaurant near the bay area and he even called there and made us a reservation so we didn't have to wait for the line.
I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
Not so at the Hilton Miami Downtown.
As was the resturant.
There's a Tapas bar on the other side of the street about a block to your right.
Except for the location, we would stay there again.
DO NOT walk too far from this Hotel.
The Hotel is good - the location is not.
Parking is super expensive, but that's Miami for you, at $28 per day.
Only the view from the hotel room made it worthwhile for me.
The location is not that good for the regular tourist with no car but a Metromover station is nearby.
However, if I will ever visit Miami again, I will book a hotel in the Art Deco District.
Weather was terrible, never so cold in Miami since 1930.
Valet parking was very pricy ($ 28) but very efficient.
Try taptap haitian restaurant for dinner, wonderful.
We booked via web and got a fair price last fall.
The location is pretty much good.
I also had great meals in the restuarant with good quality and service delivered by the staff.
I received a discount for parking for my conference and paid only $12 dollars for two nights.
Not right in South Beach, but this hotel still has a very good location near the Biscayne Bay with beautiful views!
See if you can get upgraded to a higher floor room, the view is really spectacular!
Close to a mall and generally well situated if you are in Miami for business.
Aside from the convenient location to the MetroMover, which was all we needed to get to the bayside station.
nearby the Bayside arena and a short drive to Miami Beach (art Deco).
The only drawback is that near by the hotel you do not have any life, and the park option is expensive 28 usd.
The Downtown Miami Hilton is on the fringe of the downtown area but very close to the light rail and a short drive to S. Beach and Little Havana.
Close to all - short taxi ride away.
One more note parking is 28 per day, and internet 10 bucks for 24 hrs - again something expected in a downtown major city ..no real place to park otherwise, so this may be the only option, or cab it..
When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore.
I accepted since the only reason I stayed at this Hilton was for a good nights sleep while starting a family vacation.
The 2 queen beds were NOT queen size.
Plus, they tack on an 18% service fee with the meal - 2 drinks and 2 sandwiches came to $64!!
The only downside is that it is a bit of a hassle to get to the beach compared to staying in South Beach, but I already knew that going into the stay.
Booked over the net (hotels.com)from Australia for a 4 night stay prior to a cruise from Ft Lauderdale.
Location was great 200 yds from Omni station for free Metro Mover + local bus station ($2 one way anywhere on route).
Give it 4 out of 5 for location, but 2 out of 5 for service.
The entrance is funky if you arrive by car and expect to park in the garage.
I waited in the Hilton Honors line, which was shorter than the other line.
And yes, we were now near an ice machine.
We did not make the breakfast because of the race timing, but the welcome reception was very nice.
Very nice feature.
Location is walkable to the Arsht Center, American Airlines Arena, and Bayside, but you would need a taxi/car for anything else.
The restaurant on the main level was excellent, had a variety of food and drinks.
Location is decent- fairly close to real downtown, very close to bus and train terminal for south beach etc.
But not much in walking range.
The parking was just fine: as i already wrote just pick the valet service because a) you don't want to look for a parking in this neighborhood and b) the difference between valet and single entry is risible.
The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.
$28 for valet parking, really????
I hate being fleeced for parking and this seems to be a trend in Miami.
No bar fridge in the room if you want to keep something cold.
The location was good, very close to the Bayside area and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach.
First time for the Hilton Downtown.
The location is less than optimal - the northern edge of Downtown.
Parking is absurd.
Indoor Park a block and a half away just off 2nd Ave and 14th St. on your left.
All in all, not bad if you can figure out the parking.
Great value for the money we spent and not that far from airport.
Great view was the only good thing at this hotel.
Would never stay here again and maybe not at another Hilton either.
Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.
We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton.
