Aspect: cleanliness
***** Model produced summary *****
Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler . This hotel was booked for us through our travel agent - it was near the airport & near the port of Miami where we were leaving on a cruise . Rate are cheap , but breakfast was not included and hotel charges $ 20 for breakfast buffet .
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The rooms at Hilton Miami Downtown were very clean.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The room and the bathroom were both very clean. So was the pool. The hotel seemed renovated and clean. It was hard to find a clean breakfast table at the Hilton Honors lounge though, as the supervisor was the only one who took the initiative to clean the tables.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
By-and-large everything from the facility to the rooms and bathrooms are very clean. The lounge is lacking in that department as far as clean tables go, though.
