Aspect: location
***** Model produced summary *****
We were there for 4 days / 3 nights and every day we had to track down a maid to request clean towels . The location is great , the hotel itself is fairly new so everything was clean and nicely presented . Second , after 11 pm you have to use your room card to get into the building .
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The hotel is centrally located giving you access to downtown Toronto at its best. It is conveniently close to night clubs, shopping, restaurants and Chinatown. It is also close to major downtown attractions like the Art Gallery of Ontario and cn tower/rogers centre
***** Golden Review 2 *****
Very convenient location to get to the Rogers Center. But it is also within walking distance to a night club, which is noisy until early morning. It is also close to Chinatown and other districts downtown.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The hotel is centrally located, so that you can conveniently access downtown Toronto's major attractions, including: the CN tower/rogers center, the Art Gallery of Ontario, nightlife, shopping, restaurants and Chinatown. However, it is right next to a night club, so the music is loud into the early mornings.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
It is not that hard to match up numbers on tickets to find a vehicle.
We really enjoyed our stay here, it is in good location in the Entertainment district, and though we didn't try the restauant or breakfast it looked very good!
Took about 5 minutes to walk.
Surrounded by lots of restaurants and two less than two blocks from great shopping.
There are lots of parking lots near by that look cheaper than the hotel valet system (one right across the road).
Location location location.
This hotel is in walking distance to most of the downtown attractions such as the CN Tower, Queen St, Front St, even Wayne Gretzky's restaurant is right down the street.
Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.
With regards to the nightclub next door.
There was an event on at the nightclub one night and I never heard anything.
my wife and i were on vacay.
as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.
The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
We just returned from a weekend getaway to Toronto.
The location was excellent, right across the street really from Theatres and Second City Comedy club.
We went Friday night and it was quite good!
It took almost 30 mintues to walk to Eaton's Centre and just five minutes to Roger's Centre.
The restaurant food was excellent-we had chicken stir fry and shrimp pasta.
Excellent location!
Restaurant was really good too with great service!
We had no trouble getting there - handy to Lakeshore Blvd.
Walking distance to so many things to do and see.
We liked so many thinga about this Hilton, but probably the best is LOCATION.
yet the restaurant had the same high quality as the big box Hilton.
The location of the hotel is excellent for these attractions.
Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.
We were on the 9th floor facing West and the view was so-so, but to be honest I wasn't there for the view anyway.
GOOD: Location is awesome!!!
You can pretty much walk everywhere in downtown.
We found the best street to walk - Queen Street & it's just a few short blocks from the hotel.
Walking distance to almost everything.
Not near a subway, but no need, we walked everywhere.
Stayed here for 3 nights in spring and had a good time despite the bad weather.
Great location for CN Tower/Blue Jays with plenty of local bars and restaurants, and easy access to tramcars.
We stayed here twice during our vacation.
The first night was during the huge Caribe fest and it was crazy outside!
Was close to watch the Jays, only a couple of blocks away.
1/2 block to Wayne Gretzky's!
I was sick the last day and my husband and son ditched me to tour around.
We stayed here one night on our vacation while touring the Toronto area.
We chose it because we wanted to eat at Gretzky's for supper and then visit the Hockey Hall of Fame and the CN Tower in the morning.
The location was good for us but it is definitely not the nicest area of town.
We were on the 17th floor and had a nice view of some of the taller buidings as well as the CN Tower.
4 blocks to the Rogers Centre, 3 blocks from Queen St West.
Didn't try the restaurant.
It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.
When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!
Will stay at the real Hilton the next time!
It is in a great location and in walking distance to all the entertainment in downtown Toronto!
My business associates and I are Diamond, Silver and Gold Hilton honors members and stay at Hiltons all around the world.
Main attractions (CN Tower, Skydome) are less than 10 min walk, as they are all the theatre district amenities.
I would avoid the restaurant in the hotel as the service is slow and inconsistent.
The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
Another thing is try to avoid the public parking across the hotel.
The man there told us that at the hotel we can park the car for $35 and had to take it out before 1 pm whereas we can park it for $40 in his parking until 3 pm.
Then we asked the hotel (after we parked our car in the public parking) and they said that we'd pay $35 until 3 pm!!
So it would have been much safer and cheaper to park the car at the hotel.
We enjoyed a buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant on Sunday morning and then we called the valet parking to get our cars (two cars for the 8 of us).
If you use the restaurant (we did for breakfast) don't pay with cash!!!
They don't keep change in the restaurant!!!
Also, think I may have been lucky with a view from the room of the CN Tower!
Talk about the location & amenities - Location is very central with all major attractions close by - walked everywhere.
From the airport got a car that seated 5 people and luggage and cost $65 which we didn't think was too bad - took about 25 minutes.
Say what you liked best & least - The best part in my opinion was the view of the CN Tower, but not every room will have that - other than that it would have to be the room size and beds.
The palaver with the change in the restaurant was the only niggle and although it was a little comical, I can imagine it would become very irritating if it happened more than once.
Good location, walking distance to all major attractions in Toronto.
However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.
The 15-minute walk to Union Station is very easy and convenient.
The Hotel location is excellent, near the CN Tower and many other attractions.
Great rates, Great location, friendly staff.
Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.
If you are looking for a hotel that is within walking distance of many things to do....this is the place.
It was a quick walk to the shops and restaurants on Queen Street....try Fressen if you are vegetarian/vegan....its delish!
I slept in many hotels downtown Toronto, and I can say this new Hilton hotel is the best one.
Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
Nothing to complain about (but for the freezing cold in the main hall...)
Three of us stayed for two nights on a hectic trip, arriving on an overnight flight from the States.
The hotel is in a good location, central and easy to walk from - the Art Gallery of Ontario is well worth a visit.
Location was fantastic.
Walking distance to CN Tower and other major attractions.
Shopping district for shoppers out there.
Parking rates are high as you will find in all major cities around the world.
The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended
Perfect location (CN tower and Rogers Centre just a short walk from the hotel).
Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.
We could walk to the CN Tower and Skydome as well as many restaurants, and the customers we were calling on were close by, so the location in Toronto was great for us.
With these Hilton hotels, I am always pretty certain of what to expect.
We parked our car and never looked back because everything was within walking distance.
A great place for a family of four (2 children under 10).
The hotel is very conveniently located to the nearby entertainment district, and 20 min walk to the island ferries, and is convenient to the Queen and King Streetcar lines if you wish to go further.
The location is perfect for getting around on foot.
There was a slight mix up with our booking but no fuss was made although I did find the reception staff a little disinterested but nothing to spoil my stay.
Located close to Downtown this place is on the city center.
This place is very close to the Toronto Domino Bank office which is located in Royal Trust Tower 77 King Street West.
The Toronto Central underground Station is just 5 to 7 mins away by walk, which connects to all sub-urbs.
The Only drawback of this hotel is that usage of Business Center is a bit expensive and so is the Restauant in the hotel for the qulaity of food.
The hotel has a very good location.
It's walking distance to restaurants and especially to CN Tower.
I'll stay in a Hilton Garden Inn again soon!
You can self-park but being right downtown I figured it wasn't worth the hassle to save a few bucks.
The hotel is right beside a nightclub.
The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
It's a one to ten minute walk from all the clubs in that area, in fact it's right NEXT to one.
The rooms are equal to anything Hilton offers, the fitness facility is first rate and the restaurant staff are friendly and attentive - to the right degree.
Breakfast was served in the associated restaurant (but inside the hotel) and was very good (although the yellow cheese slices we had on the first day have disappeared for the next 3 days).
Walking distance to main attractions.
Other Comments: the location is not too far from some great downtown clubs.
My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn over the July-August long weekend and had a great time!
The hotel is close enough to the big attractions to be convenient but still is not in an overly busy/loud part of town which was nice.
The CN tower is about a 15-20 minute walk as is Union Station.
The hotel location is ideal for a visitor to the city, within easy walking distance of the entertainment district, the business district, and great shopping and dining.
The second floor restaurant area was lovely and the service at breakfast could not have been better.
Within walking distance of The Princess of Wales venue.
Paid $35.00 to park overnight across the street.
I think the valet parking at the hotel is around the same amount and you can take your car in and out as needed.
Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant this morning.
We stayed here when we saw a play nearby, for which it was terrifically convenient.
And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
This hotel is a in a great location.
Close to everything downtown and the shops and restaurants of Queen St. & King St. W.... within easy walk distance of the theater district as well.
The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
on a mini-vacation for some cycling, shopping, and the New York Yankees visiting the Blue Jays.
Some caveats: The valet parking [only option] is $35 CAD.
Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
I was able to jerk the system a bit by parking elsewhere and walking a couple blocks.
This hotel is a convenient walk to Rogers Centre, China Town, and some of the theaters.
It is convenient to a nearby Shopper's Drug Mart (to pick up some in room snacks) and a large LCBO with a rather big Vintages section for some excellent wine for the room.
Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
This place is quite reasonably priced and close to some of this great city's main attractions.
The location was wonderful, a stones throw from King Street which is the entertainment district area.
It's right in the middle of the entertainment district which means you are near everything.
Close to lots of restaurants, a Whole Foods and two streetcar lines making it easy to get around.
If you have a car, consider the cost of parking.
We were visiting our children in Toronto and found the Garden Inn Downtown centrally located for every place we needed to be.
It was worth the cost of the parking just to have their assistance.
The accessible room was just that - very accessible.
Loved the area around this hotel, we had stayed around the Dundas area the previous week and this was much better.
Well done Hilton!
Perfect location for getting about town and a short walk to the CN tower and Rogers Centre.
Lot's of bars and restaurants nearby and plenty of local mini-markets for day to day necessities.
Location is good, close to nightlife, shopping, restaurants and Chinatown.
The hotel was conveniently located close to most sights in the city.
It is located in the entertainment district, close to clubs, bars, restaurants, theater, Rogers Center and the CN Tower.
While it is a few blocks from the subway, there are streetcar stops at the end of the street.
Parking is valet only (would prefer the option to self park).
Smack in the middle of Toronto entertainment district with the Rogers Dome and CN Tower just down the street!
The hotel has Valet parking only which is fine since you can walk to everything.
Great place to stay if you are going out to party you can walk back to the hotel.
So if you book more than one room specify you want adjoining if that what you want.
Great Location , great price.
This hotel is within walking distance to most major attractions.
Only down falll was $40.00 a night parking.
Fantastic location (OK they are renewing the old fashion district in the downtown core) but this hotel is quite wonderful !
Great location and a short walk to much of Toronto's sights.
