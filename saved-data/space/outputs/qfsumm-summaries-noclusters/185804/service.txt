Aspect: service
***** Model produced summary *****
We enjoyed a quick , one - night visit to Vancouver , and stayed at the Granville Island Hotel . It 's a calm , well - designed " boutique " hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island . The public spaces are nicely decorated , but our room had a couple of sad " department store " prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity , I would have loved to see better art ( why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street , and promote local artists ? )

One note for those seeking taxi's - I do not believe it is possible to just "hail" a taxi while walking about.
Unfortunately they just don't have the level of service that would make them a great hotel.

The desk staff was also very knowledgable about getting around.
Initially they were less than courteous about it but i said if there is a charge of course i would play however it might be helpful for future guests to be escorted to the bike and given a brief safety instruction prior to giving someone a key.
I stay at other expensive hotels similar to this and they do this service, they also do not charge for the bikes if you are a guest of the hotel.

Nothing was too much trouble for them.
The staff were simply delightful and the food is hard to beat ..... anywhere!
Buses also run from the entrance of Granville Island to Downtown.
