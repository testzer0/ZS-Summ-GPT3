Aspect: location
***** Model produced summary *****
Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review ; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge . The hotel restaurant was no great shakes but it is walking distance to some great eateries . The hotel was very well positioned to do that being central to all the major downtown stores and Pike Pklace Market .
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The hotel is conveniently located. Only minutes from the shopping areas and about 6 blocks to Pike's Place.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to all the major shopping and Pike's Place Market, as well as the convention center, the bus and light rail tunnel, Westlake Center, and a number of restaurants and shops
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The hotel is conveniently located, within walking distance to Pike's Place Market, Capitol Hill, Belltown, and the Space Needle. It's also close to the convention center, bus and light rail tunnel, and Westlake Center, as well as downtown restaurants and shopping.

The hotel was very well positioned to do that being central to all the major downtown stores and Pike Pklace Market.
The hotel restaurant was no great shakes but it is walking distance to some great eateries.
The restaurant was always convenient for a quick happy hour and even allowed me to take a drink or a dessert upstairs; the concierge went out to the store to deliver me a Sunday NY Times newspaper.
Don't take a room on the inside unless you want to be awakened by the garbage trucks at 5am.

The hotel it in plain downtown - 10min.

Right across the street from Ruth's Chris Steak House and the Grand Hyatt.
He got a nice tip for that.
My two girlfriends and I stayed here for New Year's 2011, and it was a wonderful surprise to find out how centrally-located the Paramount was.
Small portions to share, beyond cheap happy hour prices (we didn't pay over $5 for anything we ordered.)
Only downside was the valet parking.
The Paramount is a solid value with an outstanding location.
Its very central to both the waterfront and Pikes Place market as well as the Seattle center where the space needle is located.

It was quiet and is in a nice central location.
The restaurant downstairs has amazing happy hours with great food and drink specials.
I had a corner room and the view was exceptional.
My only complaint is that the ice machines are on every other floor.

Dragonfish restaurant is attached and has great seafood and sushi.
Go "downhill" two blocks to get a great view of the space needle.

The Paramount is in a great location for sightseeing and shopping.
Everything is at your doorstep.
We were on the 4th floor facing the Hyatt so we didn't really have a view.
The pros: - Convenient the location, walking distance to Pike Place Market (8 short blocks) and Bell Town.
One had wobbly paddles and the other one squeaked when you paddle.
Our GPS system had been stolen.
When we talked to the front desk, they told us they contract out their parking (United Parking) and referred us to the supervisor of the company.
Valet parking was terrible.
The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.

The location is excellent being just a short walk to Pike Place and various neighborhoods for shopping and dining.

The location of the hotel is great...close to the convention center, bus and light rail tunnel, Westlake Center as well as restaurants and shopping.
Parking is all valet and $27/day.
DragonFish, the restaurant downstairs was good too.
Easy walk to light rail, Monorail, Pike Place Market.
We even walked to the pier to catch the Victoria Clipper.
(To avoid the stairs down to Alaskan Way, walk down Wall St. or look for the elevator near the Marriot on Western Ave.)
The fire place in the reception area was a nice touch since it was raining when I arrived at the hotel.
Location wise it's brilliant, a block away from the convention centre, Pike's Market just 6 blocks away and Caffe Ladro just opposite the hotel!
Location-wise, this hotel is just a short walk to all of the attractions, and the monorail, which will get you over to the Space Needle and Experience Music Project area.
We didn't eat at the restaurant on the main floor, but it seemed to be busy at all the peak times, so I can only assume that means the food is decent.
Off-lobby sushi restaurant also serves conventional breakfast, lively at night.
But walking over to Pike and up a couple blocks, you're at Tango, never to be missed on any trip to Seattle.
This is a well-run place.
The location is within a reasonable walking distance of shopping, restaurants, and the Pike Place Market (if you pack the proper shoes!).
Things I don't love about the Paramount: The view isn't much --- the rooms look toward other high-rise buildings.
We were close to everything, walking distance to Pike Place Market.
Most importantly though was how close everything was.
It's right in Downtown and everything but the Space Needle is walkable--shopping and restaurants.
It's also really close to Westlake Station (2 blocks), so if you fly in/out and don't want to rent a car, this is a great option--only $2.75 per person each way.
Otherwise, the Hotel is in a good location for sightseeing and shopping..
The location is great (ten minute walk from Pike Place Market) but construction in and around the area means you're forced to use valet parking ($25/night).
The in-house restaurant is mediocre but not too pricey.
first off, the location is stellar.
easy 8 block walk to pike place market.
Location is excellent; the hotel is within walking distance of a bunch of restaurants and the downtown shopping.
The location is very good, in the thick of shopping and restaurants, halfway between Pike St. Market and Capitol Hill.
A nice touch- there's complimentary internet computers off the lobby and the hotel's restaurant, Dragonfish has good sushi/pan-Asian food if you don't want to go outside in the rain.
The location was excellent (near downtown shopping as other reviewers have mentioned).
Compared to the Portland location, the Seattle Paramount needs some sprucing up.
My favorite thing about this hotel is how close it is to everything.
All the best shopping in Seattle is within close walking distance.
It's an easy quick walk to Pike's Place Market and waterfront.
But really the hotel is a $7 cab ride to anything that you want to see that isn't near by.
Finally there is a restraunt downstairs called Dragonfish that is excellent.
They are low priced and have and incredible late night happy hour.
It was easy to find street parking (so we didn't need to pay the hotel parking rate).

The hotel was a short 2 block walk away.
Very convenient when one does not want to hassle with a rental car.
The hotel was in a great location within walking distance to all the major shopping and Pike's Place Market.
The area felt safe and it was walking distance to the light rail to the airport; I took some longer walks to Capital Hill, to an Episcopal church on Sunday morning and to the Pike Place market area several times--all were fun walks to take.
Hotel is a few blocks from the center of downtown and convenient to underground bus (1 block) and light rail station/monorail (2 blocks); easy walk (7 blocks) to Pike Place Market.
The Paramount is at a great location for downtown activities, but at a more reasonable price than the nearby big-name hotels.
Clean rooms, pleasant staff with good restaurant recommendations, and fast, free internet.
This is a small place and they react quickly.
2- Smart layout.
3- Location.
Lots of shopping and restaurants within 2 - 3 blocks.
Bartell's drugstore with trial size toiletries next to Nordstroms.
The downtowner shuttle also drops off within a block of the hotel and the new light rail to Seatac has a stop right on Pine at one of the malls.
Cons 1- No view really.
Across the street from the Paramount Theater, and down the street from Pacific Place and Westlake Mall, this hotel offers a great location for tourists wanting to stay in town to be close to all that's going on, as well as for residents that are looking for a weekend of culture or shopping in the city.
Location was amazing with 2 movie theatres (our bellman went down and printed off the movie listings from their computer and brought them back to our room) and markets easily walkable.
Restaurant staff was also very poor
The location is excellent (especially if you like to shop!)
I especially like the Dragonfish Cafe restaurant - it is one of my favorite restaurants for Asian Fusion.
It is close to everything and it was convenient to walk everywhere.
I especially liked the Japanese restaurant attached to this hotel (not sure if it is part of the hotel), but it is open late and has a very well priced happy hour and late night happy hour.
We ate there very late one night and there was a good crowd and the place was very lively.
The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.
We booked for 3 nights through Priceline.
Parking was additional but there is a free computer for use.
No laundry, which would be helpful for those traveling for a long time.The location is in the heart of Seattle.
An easy 10 minute walk to Pike Market and other attractions or take the free underground bus.
Only downside is the charge for parking, $27 a night, but that is now standard, if not low, for parking in Seattle.
Location is good- between 2 bus/light rail stations and easy walking to Pike Place Market.
