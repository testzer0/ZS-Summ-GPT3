This was probably one of the best Starwod properties I have stayed in the last year.
The hotel is about 40 minutes from DFW airport in downtown Dallas.
The room was spacious enough, with a big glass wall on the outside, a 42" flat screen TV, and terrific lighting arrangements that allowed you to adjust the brightness in various parts of the room.
The bed was very comfy.
The bath and toilet were divided into two separate rooms, and the sink area was separate.
This can be useful for couples staying in the room.
There was a complimentary bottle of water, and toiletries were top notch.
We were staying only one night and were most looking forward to lounging leisurely next to the beautiful pool on Sunday afternoon.
When the elevator opened on the floor of the pool, we could already hear and feel the bass from the LOUD music and crowd.
The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
None of these partiers were paying hotel guests, but they were definitely treated better than any of the guests we saw there.
They finally were ok with the outside food once they realized we were NOT moving it and were still quite unhappy about the pool situation.
The Joule was a great hotel to stay at in Dallas.
When we got to our room it was very modern and high tech with all of the light switches and lamp knobs.
However, we didn't reserve a handicap room but got oen anyway with two beds.
We ate breakfest downstairs at Charlie Palmer which was one of the best hotel breakfest experiences I have ever had.
After reading all of the brilliant reviews on The Joule, I selected it for my wedding night.
My husband and I booked a suite for three nights.
What I received is exactly what was listed for the room.
All in all, this hotel was nothing special with a high price tag.
The Joule is not luxurious in comparison and not sure why Starwood has it branded as such.
This is a W Hotel wanna-be for the over 40 set.
The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.
The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
My girlfriend and I decided on this hotel for a short weekend trip to Dallas.
From the pictures posted online we thought we were in for a treat.
We stayed in the Penthouse Suite and the service and the room was perfect.
The bathroom was clean and beautiful.
The master bedroom was beautiful, comfortable and had great views of downtown Dallas.
If you are headed to Dallas this is a great hotel in a great city.
Stayed here for a leisure weekend.
Downtown area around it is sort of dead... the structure itself is a period building, renovated into a boutique hotel.
Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".
I wasn't crazy about the way the bathroom is a bit open to the room.
This hotel would have been adequate if the room price was much less.
We complained and they just moved us to an even smaller room with the same view.
The gym is in desperate need of an upgrade.
It might be where the young people of Texas go to spend their money on dinner and drinks in the bar but its not the place to stay overnight.
You must lay by the gorgeous pool as well.
Most definitely the best hotel in Dallas!
I thought the Joule was an awesome hotel.
1 - the hotel smells great but it is a little strong for me.
It was almost as if the hotel lobby and elevators were wearing cologne and it was a good scent but I am a little sensitive to scents so it was a little strong for me but was nice when walking in from the street.
2 - We stayed in the Demi-Joule room and it was very small.
Didn't really bother us because it was laid out well but if we had been there a number of days and spent them in the room, it would have gotten cramped.
The Joule has a modern feel kind of like the W but it is warmer feeling and more comforatble than the W. The pool at the Joule is amazing and is actually where they film the outdoor bar scenes for ABC's The Deep End which is the show is set in LA but is actually filmed in Dallas.
I stayed at The Joule for an extended amount of time throughout the summer.
When deciding on where to stay for my training I was looking for a clean, upper scale hotel with exceptional service.
Well, I picked the right one.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone; it is clean, luxurious and has out of this world service.
They had a bottle of champagne,yummy chocolates and a cheese platter in the room.
We stayed in one of the lofts and initially had some temperature issues but they were addressed quickly.
The room was fantastic.
Two of the three bathrooms had huge walk in showers and double showerheads.
The pool area was packed and we had a cabana reserved for us.
The pool is small but they keep it very cool and refreshing.
It had a mini-Vegas poolside vibe.
Brand new hotel which is nice since so many hotels do not update once they are a little older.
Very contemporary hotel but classy.
They had free bottle of wine and chocolates in our room for our anniversary which was nice but I had to ask 3 times for ice bucket (it is small hotel so there are no ice machines on the floors).
Charlie Palmer cooks the room service menu but it is different menu than restaurant and didn't look as good (no foie gras).
The hotel can arrange for in room or couples massage from Sedona.
We had dinner at Nobu which is in Crescent Court which was really good too.
The hotel is gorgeous and our room was clean, modern, and just as I expected a Luxury Starwood Hotel should be.
The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars (if I could it would be 4.75) on "Service" is b/c they weren't so timely on pre-arranged room service...we asked for it by a certain time and it arrived about a half hour later.
The rooftop pool was very relaxing.
An Infinity pool hangs over Main Street providing for a unique panorama of downtown Dallas.
We definitely look foward to returning to this downtown Dallas gem.
A colleague and I flew into Dallas to meet with some vendors and came across this hotel through Starwood.
It is unlike any Starwood I have stayed at and we were delighted to have a boutique experience with the perks of a Starwood hotel.
The rooms were pretty tight, but were definitely comfy and unique.
Swam at the pool on the roof one day and had breakfast in the restaurant.
The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
My only real negative was that I'm an avid swimmer and the pool was closed for a private party from approx 6 pm until 10 the evening of our stay.
The management opened the pool later (10-midnight) so we decided to try it then.
Not only was no one swimming in the pool - but all of the "beautiful people" - I assume from the evening's party - were still hanging around in cocktail dresses and sportcoats.
I would say for us, it was beyond luxury!
shower.
Would I recommend the Joule to others?
Well the fact that 3 days later I was wishing I was there again should answer the question.
Great property in a downtown location.
The rooms are pretty standard for a luxury hotel; I'm SPG platinum and find I get a suite upgrade more often at the W but rarely at the Joule.
The gym is okay, but somewhat small.
The pool is also small, but it does have a great view of downtown.
Overall I'd recommend the W over the Joule but they are both great hotels.
I used to stay at the W as it is a higher category but after some incidents I'm staying at the Joule from now on.
I was pleased to find out it is actually a better hotel overall and sad I didn't discover this sooner.
This is a great hotel to visit.
The rooms are awesome except for the lack of privacy in the toilets that others have mentioned.
Overall, can't wait to come back.
The pool is great, it has great night life, and the rooms and beds are great!
That bed is the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever stayed in.
I stay at the Joule 3 to 4 nights a week each week as I commute to Dallas.
I am local to the area and on the recommendation of a co-worker, i stayed at the Joule instead of Zaza.
Zaza is out and the Joule is the place to be
This is one of our favorite hotels in Dallas for our Staycation weekends, its literally a hotel you never have to live and can live without a car for a weekend.
Our guests are typically on the younger side, but everyone at the hotel has always treated them with the utmost of respect.
The warm, modern feel of the hotel is a big hit with our guests!
They also love the pool area that overlooks Main street!
We just returned from a week-end get away for our anniversary at the Joule.
We were upgraded from a regular deluxe room to a Loft Suite and even received a bottle of champagne.
All I can say is.....AMAZING.
Truly a luxury week-end.
Great hotel interiors, dark moody decor in rooms.
We stayed in a Junior Suite and it was well equipped.
Having said at, the bathroom was big, and really nice.
This hotel is WONDERFUL.
The Joule Suite was classy, comfortable and spacious.
Great room for a relaxing weekend getaway.
Loved it!!!
We especially enjoyed our time at the pool, and Todd made the weekend so much more fun!
We wanted something that was unique and my wife found The Joule.
I look forward to going back to Dallas just to stay at The Joule
i had a business conference in Dallas and was fortunate enough to get a discounted rate at the Joule for myself and a few colleagues.
The Joule is one of the best hotels in downtown Dallas, the interior of the hotel is gorgeous as are the rooms.
The pool with the inifinty edge over Main St was an added attraction, great place to hang out and people watch!
The hotel was beautiful; the staff was very accommodating; and it was very easy working with a large group.
Rooms, pool, lobby, design, etc are all well deserving of the accolades they receive.
When boutique properties get it right it's a special thing - Walking away feeling fortunate just to have had the experience is why we seek out places to stay such as the Joule.
The Joule is certainly amongst the best hotels within the SPG system.
Stayed here for a few days for business last year.
From the lobby to the rooms, this hotel has been very tastefully decorated â€¢ Rooms â€“ Very chic rooms.
The standard rooms are nice enough Overall, this is a fantastic hotel and certainly one of the best in SPG in North America.
other than that the bathroom is not very private so if you want to preserve the "romance" factor you'll need to make a trip to the lobby because the ballroom level restroom is kept locked.
This hotel is AMAZING!
The roof top pool area is so romatic and the bartenders keep your glasses full.
There is no other hotel in Dallas, Texas that comes close to comparison.
(Not Four Seasons, Not Zaza, Not The Crescent) Get my point?
Your room or suite will come with a fully stocked bar and snacks.
The suite does come with dimmers on all of the light switches.....
The jacuzzi is very welcoming and comfortable....
VERY, VERY nice property.
The pool (or Poule as they call it) is as nice as any you will find, glass on the end which extends out at 10 stories high.
The adults at the pool were making out to the point a few of the couples should have went back to their rooms, needless to say we didn't stay at the pool long.
Working with this hotel has been a breeze.
So instead of going out of town we planned a special Saturday and Sunday at the Hotel Joule in Dallas, Tx.
I've already recommended the hotel to co-workers and friends that plan on celebrating their anniversaries at the Joule!!
We booked this hotel under luxury hotel and resort collection.
Booked the hotel based on the pool/pool bar.
Arrived and the pool bar doesn't open until 3 pm (not mentioned when I called the hotel directly and... Who is laying by the pool only after 3 pm?!?!)
AND the pool was closed for a "photo shoot" that took up the whole pool for a majority of the afternoon.
Stay at luxury hotels frequently and would recommend ANYWHERE in dallas other than this!
But I have stayed here three times since and like the hotel.
We stayed here for an Anniversary weekend getaway in Dallas and we were very impressed with the rooms and the service!
The room details were well thought out.
Although the room we were in was a bit small, they had really nice decor and details that you would not see a Marriott or a Hilton, IMHO.
The photos were interesting, the bathrooms unique, and the bed was really comfortable.
The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
I will hopefully be back -- as the revitalized Main St. has a lot of action on the weekends and this hotel sits right in the middle!
BTW, the pool and PM Lounge are really cool!
The Joule is an absolute Jewel.
The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious and luxurious with all the amenities you could ask for.
Immediately I contacted family and friends to share my experience and offer my recommendation to stay at The Joule.
We look forward in experiencing The Joule again in the near future as we continue to recommend to others.
We were impressed with how intimate and different this hotel is.
The room was beautifully appointed with a round bed, bvlagari amenities, rainfall shower, and oversized flat screen.
The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
Other than that no complaints, beautiful pool on the 10th floor and up to date fitness center with bottles of water and fruit.
The Joule really is a gem and I would return but probably would opt for a different room catogory
I travel at least once a month for work, and I was fortunate enough to stay at this hotel last February and it's such a charming hotel.
The hotel and guest rooms are cozy without feeling too small.
When in Dallas stay Here!!
Well it started off BAD within 10 mins we had went to the pool where we find about 5 young ladies workin and just stood there looking like we where not even there, so I was like excuse me can I get a drink.
Please do not waste ur money go to ZAZAS, The W, or the Ritz
This was my first stay at The Joule in Dallas.
I usually stay at the "W' in Victory Park, but this Hotel was by far outstanding!
The rooms were fantastic, very clean, and had awesome showers!!!
The pool was amazing as well, met a lot of nice couples on my stay, everyone was very laid back and had a great time!
The Joule is elegantly eclectic.
The Joule Dallas is a hoteliers dream.
The beds are luxurious and will envelop you in dream inducing comfort.
The clean lines and technically savvy components of the guest rooms ensure that you remain at ease and connected while you travel.
Great hotel that should not be missed!
Loved that the desk was behind the headboard - clever use of space!
My bell man walked me through the different settings & gagets in the room, that was really useful.
My only regret is that i wasn't here on a weekend to experience the nightclub downstairs or in the summer to hangout by the roof top pool all day and drink cocktails!!
I am a platinum starwood member and typically stay at the W Hotel or Westin properties.
However, they were sold out and I always noticed the Joule Dallas hotel in the search results on SPB.com.
Everything from room service from the top Charlie Palmer restaurant in the hotel 24/7, plus the stunning gorgeous pool, amazing rooms, etc, etc.
The Joule Dallas.
Afterwards you can write your own review on this intimate and polished hotel.
It is one of a kind and nothing else can compare in Dallas or wherever you may be....
You will not be disappointed here .
absolutely beautiful property, rooms are spacious and modern, roof-top pool area is excellent, and restaurant is 5-star.
Dinner at Charlie Palmer's was simply superb!
The pool is amazing and the restaurant cuisine is outstanding.
I had a wonderful stay at the hotel, loved the rooms, even though our room was a bit small they utilized the space very well.
I also had a $45.00 charge or room service for a breakfast we ordered that was suppose to be included in the package when we made our reservations.
Fun pool atmosphere!
Spent 1 night at the Joule for a weekend away from the kids.
Would ask for room on another floor next time.
We just returned home after spending three nights at The Joule.
The beds were comfortable, the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were pleasant and quiet even though it was crowded for the UT/OU game.
The pool was too chilly for the kids to spend much time in it, but that isn't surprising for this time of year.
There was a mix-up with an upgrade for our room, but that was the only disappointment with our stay.
We've stayed at many 5-star hotels, and the Joule is in the top 2 for sure.
We were only scheduled to stay one night, but it was so incredible, we stayed another night.
The room had a sexy contemporary decor.
We really enjoyed it.
I loved the bathroom set up and the shower was huge, big enough for 4 couples (if you're into that sort of thing).
That night we visited the PM Lounge that's located in the basement of the hotel.
3) Enjoy the ambiance - The rooms are so fun and decorative, our stay was wonderful!
Again, we had such a fun time and it's really one of the better hotels to stay at .
This hotel is awesome.
See this being perfect for business (nice desk, free internet) or a romantic getaway.
As a bonus it is a Starwood property.
From it's convenient location to the Dallas business hub for guests, to the captivating style of the hotel, to the impeccable service, this was the perfect place for my event.
We reserved a guest room which was beautiful and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast on the patio Saturday morning at Charlie Palmer's Restaurant.

For Xmas, my husband and I decided to book a suite at the Joule.
The suite was wonderful.
The bathroom was beautiful with a large soaking tub, a shower room and excellent lighting.
It was incredibly trendy and modern without being intimidating and cold.
I can't get over the bathroom.
Would I stay here again?
A Swedish massage and organic egg breakfast were included and were most memorable.
A Swedish massage and organic egg breakfast were included and were most memorable.
My wife and I spent one night at the Joule and had an excellent time.
Our suite was quiet and nicely appointed.
We had drinks at the hotel bar and dinner at Charlie Palmers.
Also, I must admit I took the liberty of telling alot of my friends about the beautiful pool that I had an hour to indulge in!
The decor, overall atmosphere, and excellent service in this hotel exceeds expectation.
I would recommend this hotel to my existing and future out of town business clients when they visit, and I plan to make this my home away from home while conducting such visits.
Not only was the hotel incredible with an amazing room, but the service and amenities are top notch.
This is an excellent hotel with an amazing rooftop pool and lounge area.
I thought I had seen it all until I stayed at the Joule.
It's rare to find a hotel with so much attention to detail and it's obvious that no expense was spared.
The entire hotel is a work of art and when I got to my room I spent the first hour exploring it's uniqueness.
I had dinner at the restaurant that night and it was amazing from the service, ambiance and quality of the food.
They have a special lunch that includes a soup, salad and half sandwich that's quick and inexpensive.
The Joule is a sexy, elegant, fun, cool and incredibly unique experience.
Amazing Hotel!
Rooms are very well appointed.
Best Bathroom Amenities I have ever used ...
The POOL scene is incredible on the roof!
A friend and I decided to have a fun girls weekend away in Dallas and one of the hotels we'd heard was great was the Joule.
Once we got there, we ended up hardly leaving our hotel the entire 3 nights/4 days we were there over New Years Eve, as we loved our room and the hotel so much.
My husband and I stayed at the Joule In late January.
We stayed in a deluxe room.
It was by no means big, but it was perfect for two.
We both loved the shower.
My only complaint about our room was that one side faced east and the bathroom window was not adequately covered so the morning sun lit up the whole room.
Bed was very plush and comfortable.
I've stayed at all the SPG and major Marriott hotels in Dallas and this is by far the best.
2nd best in W Victory (which is where I stay during sports events.)
Everything from the lobby to the rooftop pool has a very modern look.
I stayed in a suite on the 9th floor and had no complaints.
My very good friend booked a room at the Joule for her birthday last weekend and invited a few friends, myself included, to celebrate a safe and enjoyable evening.
We began the evening in the hotel room, then walked a short distance to a nearby resturant for dinner.
We began the evening in the hotel room, then walked a short distance to a nearby resturant for dinner.
(Apparently we weren't the only guests to have their evening botched by this hotel).
I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.
We had an amazing time celebrating our daughter's 13TH birthday at the Joule in Dallas....from the time we were greeted until the time we checked out, we were made to feel special and welcomed.
Our tweens loved the salt water heated infinity pool, the Charlie Palmer bar, awesome room service and gorgeous room......we live in Carrollton, but felt we had traveled to another luxurious country!
Very high end hotel that lived up to the hype.
From the moment we pulled up and until we left we felt very welcomed and enjoyed all the hotel has to offer.
The roof top pool was like a spa and even though it was 102 degrees, it felt very comfortable because of the fans and the misting system.
I would highly recommend this hotel as a great place to get away and enjoy downtown Dallas.
My wife and I stayed the weekend at the Joule for our 16th wedding anniversary.
The room product is gorgeous and the beds are extremely comfortable.
I am a self-proclaimed (and other people proclaim it too) hotel snob and I couldn't have been happier!
This is my number 1 choice of hotel in Dallas, Texas.
The hotel is very posh and modern.
We loved the auto curtains and bathroom facilities.
We loved the auto curtains and bathroom facilities.
I felt like we were in a clean and futuristic hotel.
I would love for more hotels like the joule to be around when i visit different places.
This is the Perfect Hotel!!!
The room was just beautiful.
Beds so comfortable that you don't want to leave.
The pool area after the sun goes down is amazing.
I look forward to my next stay at the Joule.
Maybe I just had a bad experience but I was throughly disappointed in this hotel.
Pros: The rooms were very clean and nice.
This was, simply the best hotel experience we have ever had.
My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our anniversary.
The pool!
It was a salt water pool on the 12th floor that juts out over Main Street in Dallas.
The concierge came and gave us our room key when our room was ready.
The room was immaculate - superbly decorated, super clean, and there was a complimentary bottle of champagne for us, with truffles and a lovely note from the manager.
The room was superb!
Large, quiet, excellent!
Stay here - it's expensive, but absolutely worth it - we plan on returning next anniversary!
I wish i did not have to cut my trip short, because the pool looked like a lot of fun.
Two balconies offer two views.
I was there for 3 nights.
I stayed at the Joule in Feb for a quick little training session I was sent to.
Dallas was one of the most friendly places I've visited and this hotel is right up there with making you feel at home.
The rooms are astonishing, my favorite detail in the entire room was the lights that are built into the headboard.
This hotel is wonderful, business traveler or just getting away.
This was a enjoyable place to spend the weekend .
Let's not forget the pool, great relaxing spot.
