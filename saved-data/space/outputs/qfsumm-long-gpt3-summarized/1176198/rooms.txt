***** Sentences in Cluster ****
At first i thought this was the perfect Hotel for our first trip to Toronto.
The location is great, the hotel itself is fairly new so everything was clean and nicely presented.
Fifth, we were told there was 24 hour room service, when we inquired about room service we were told the kitchen was closed!
Sixth, we were told over the phone that we could get a roll out bed (cot) for free, when we arrived we were informed that to add a roll out bed would be a fire hazard.
Stayed here for 4 nights in June (just before the G20 summit so was full of police officers - never felt safer!).
A fairly small hotel for Toronto but modern (it is a pretty new property) and very, very clean.
We had one of the King rooms with a whirlpool.
It had a lovely spacious bathroom and a really comfortable bed.
It had a lovely spacious bathroom and a really comfortable bed.
There was also a fire in the room which I imagine would be cozy on winter nights.
Would definitely chose this hotel again!
We stayed at this hotel for a conference at the Toronto convention center.
The hotel was clean and the rooms modern and good sized.
The bathroom was lovely and clean as well.
Overall great hotel and all you need for downtown Toronto!
We love this hotel.It is clean and beautiful.The staff treat you like friends.It is so centrally located that you can access downtown Toronto at its best.You are in walking distance to everything.We will be staying here again for sure.
The rooms are beautiful and spacious.
My wife and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary.
Rooms are clean and spacious with your own refrigerator and microwave.
Since this hotel is fairly new, the bathrooms are very nice.
The bed was the most comfortable bed that I've ever slept in.
It is a sleep number bed so you can adjust the firmness.
Indoor pool if you want to take a dip.
Stayed here for a week, the hotel is nice, rooms are nicely appointed.
For some this may not be an issue, but also be aware, most rooms do not have bathtubs, just standup showers, so if you like to bath or have children who you need to bath, this is likely not the best choice.
and we were out most of the day, we had a bed, tv,shower, toilet, coffee maker, fridge, and a microwave.
the pool and jacuzzi were awesome after waling around all day.
the room was perfect, comfy, almost felt like we were home.
good breakfast.
the hotel itself was perfect.
hotel cant help that.
We stayed on a wag jag jaunt deal and upgraded to a jacuzzi room.
The room was lovely, fireplace jacuzzi king sized bed.
The bed had a control to change firmness which was neat- overall could have been softer but no complaints.
Only other thing to note would be that the jacuzzi jets randomly turned on a couple of times but it was never when we were sleeping so not a big deal.
I stayed for 5 days attending a conference and would stay here again.
Pros: convenient central lOcation, very comfortable bed, free wifi are all great aspects for business or leisure traveler to have.
There was also a small fridge and microwave in the room.
Other non-weekend nights were better.
I recently stayed at te Hilton Garden Inn to try something different.
The room was clean and quite large.
We had a room with a stand up shower which was fine by me.
I truly disliked the bed.
It was an adjustable bed that allows you to choose the softness, I found it to be lumpy and uncomfortable.
we enjoyed the pool and hot tub albeit not very deep.
My fav part was the breakfast buffet.
We had purchased two WagJag Jaunt coupons for $149 a night.
That included $50's per day toward any hotel expense as well as the breakfast buffett.
The hotel was very clean, room was quite large and shower had good water pressure.
The room had a small fridge, microwave and large TV.
The breakfast buffett was very well stocked and had lots of options.
Made to order eggs, french toast, waffles, omlettes, fresh fruit, cereals, selection of pastries, yogurts..you name it.
The pool and hot tub looked nice and clean, although we didnn't use it.
Met family in Toronto for Blue Jays games and had two rooms, each with two beds reserved for Saturday night.
After 5 PM they still did not have two rooms available and suggested we go to dinner and then they'd be ready, Well, at 7:30, after dinner, they still did not have rooms ready (housekeeping still working on them!!!).
Front desk person said we could get into two adjoining rooms right away, but each room only had a king bed and a pull-out couch.
We took them, but when went up, one of the rooms only had one bed and no couch!!
Our original two rooms were finally clean but had already been given to someone else.
Ended up with a nice room on the tenth floor with a good view of the CN Tower.
Great location, especially for going to Rogers Centre, plenty of places to eat nearby, very good breakfast buffet, and has pool for the kids.
Great hotel!
We could see the CN tower from our room.
Bathroom very clean.
I spent a night here using a wagjag voucher (amazing deal), the hotel was great, nice room, very friendly staff.. loved the free cookies in the lobby!
Everything about this hotel was great it's too bad something so negative like this is pretty much out of their control.
We had a Wag Jaunt for a 2 day stay this past week for 4 friends ( my 19 yr dtr.
Cora's is just down the street for lunch.
Breakfast was wonderful- the staff encouraged us to take whatever we wanted to go - with paper bags made available.
We were so pleased with this hotel that we stayed an extra night!
That said, the rooms were wery nice and a good size for a city hotel.
The hotel seemed to have a balance of families, business, foreign tour bus groups and couple travelers.
The beds are firm but the pillows are soft (perfect combo for me).
OKAY, LASTLY - - BREAKFAST IS AWESOME.
Pool/Hot Tub isn't much to write home about.
The hotel delivers on everything it promises.
I used the room for sleeping and to prepare for some meetings.
Quiet, comfortable and utilitarian.
The bed and the linens were excellent.
The prices were comparative to the restaurants in the neighborhood with the difference that service was much better and of course there was the convenience.
The hotel also had professional trained desk personnel.
I got what I paid for and a bit more at that.
Maybe some hotels have a lower rate, but if you are looking for consistency, and quality at a competitive room rate in the downtown core, you really cannot go wrong with this place.
We stay here often.
The rooms are modern, very clean and have many more amenities than one expects, including fridge, microwave, large HDTV, adjustable bed, spacious bathroom and, if upgrading, a wonderful Jacuzzi.
Hot breakfast is on until 11am for (civilized) late sleepers, and offers lots to choose from, all good and very well prepared.
Spent the Thanksgiving weekend at the Hilton Garden Inn on Peter St. A lovely, clean, modern hotel downtown.
Wonderful beds and linens.
The pool and spa were much appreciated as was the Marquis dining room where we had a great breakfast in a relaxed atmosphere.

This was my second visit to a Hilton Garden Inn and it will not be my last.
I recently travelled to Toronto on business and stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn downtown.
This hotel, by far, is the BEST hotel I have every stayed at.
The service was exceptional and the rooms are very clean and comfortable.
They have an incredible pool and gym that are both kept impeccably clean.
They have an incredible pool and gym that are both kept impeccably clean.
Be it for personal or business I highly recommend this property....it's location to all downtown amenities, sites coupled with the extrodinary customer service and high quality room make it a must!
I went to The Hilton Garden Inn on Peter Street for a one night stay with my BF to celebrate our Anniversary, we opted for the King Room with Jacuzzi and Fireplace.
For anyone wondering (like we were), the tub is huge, more than enough room for two people.
The area is FULL of restaurants and it's literally a 5 min walk from Front Street.
I have stayed at this Hilton Garden on Peter street on business many, many times-so when planning a weekend visit with the family I had no hesitation to book- Its well situated, clean and modern and generally a very good value and the Hhnonors perks are good- WOW what a difference during the weekend-instead of business folk and tourists-its packed with club kids and partyers-the staff do their best-but its noisy and the area around the hotel is pretty crazy late in the evening on weekends- I will stay again during the week-but never on a weekend
I have nothing bad to say about this hotel, helpful staff, clean tidy room, comfy beds, great location, it was a perfect place to stay.
Plus the spa had too much chlorine in and that my eye's were stinging.
Would I use this hotel again?
BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.
Can't imagine if you're on the lower floors!!
Also, tons of bars everywhere!!!
The hotel's restaurants was actually good too!
We wanted to be close to everything but didn't want to spend major bucks to, so we decided on this hotel; we didn't regret it!
Nice clean room, big bed, big shower in the room.
The hotel is very conveniently located in downtown Toronto and overall the stay was very satisfactory for the price.
I used the fitness center and pool which were both small but well maintained.
Pros: room very clean and well-lit; staff extremely helpful; extra comfortable beds (probably one of the best hotel beds I've slept in) Cons: room internet was very slow except for very basic email checks; breakfast room was understaffed so that two frantic staff-members were running around looking very flustered and struggling to deal with all the guests
Stayed here for our last night at end of two weeks in Canada, having stayed at the Marriot Residence Inn in the Entertainment district for the first 3 nights of our holiday, Whilst we got a good value deal there for a one bedroom suite, I have to say I preferred the Hilton.
Clean, shiny new hotel with spacious welcoming lobby and attractive decor.
Our room had two double beds with all new fitments to a high quality.
Linen crisp and clean, beds comfy, v quiet with view over CN Tower.
Pool and hot tub clean, though bizarrly no changing room.
The most strikingly superior feature compared to The Residence Inn was the breakfast which was AMAZING at the Hilton!
My kids loved making their own waffles, whilst a chef prepared cooked breakfast/omelettes/pancakes to order.
In summary, comfortable clean moderm hotel in great location - I would definately stay here again!
Lotsa partiers everywhere, but thanks to hotel staff & security you'd never know.
:-) Rooms VERY clean and were comfortable and roomy...sitting chairs and ottomans to put your feet up.
Would definitely stay here again when we go to our next Jays game!
Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.
On the first night there, (a Friday night) our room was on the 16th floor and faced south.
After getting only 4 hours of sleep, I requested a new room.
The next night I was in a North facing room and it was fine.
The hotel is beautifully decorated, very modern and the restaurant was great for breakfast.
They only put us on the 8th floor.
My room was sizeable, very clean, in fact the entire hotel has an almost brand new feel to it.
The bathroom has no bathtub (who uses that in hotels anyway?)
and instead had a very large glassed in shower area.
Fridge and microwave in the room were very convenient.
the Pool, while not large, was comfortable and clean, and the workout facilities were excellent.
All in all, a great overnight, and I would not hesitate to stay there again.
My boyfriend and I stayed here this past weekend january 21-23 and the people were nice not that we were in the hotel to much other than to sleep but the bed was absolutely awful it was like sleeping on a board.
my boyfriend and i both went home sore and dead tired from trying to find a comfortable way to sleep tossing and turning all night but there was none.
we were so tired and sore from bad sleep we went home early on monday without shopping or anything the room was kind of plain we had the room with a jacuzzi and fireplace but both nights when we were in bed sleeping the jacuzzi mysteriously turned on and woke us both up and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off.
overall the people were nice but because of the uncomfortable bed we would not stay here again.
Stayed here for two nights in July while the Red Sox were in town (Rogers Centre).
Hotel is new, everything was in good working order.
Rooms were large for a downtown hotel, nicely appointed.
We had 2 Queen beds as well as an arm chair, desk, and flat-panel television.
Bathroom was a good size, with typical HGI finishings and amenities.
The hotel was sold out for both nights we were there and we didn't hear any neighbours, ever.
Pool is very small, and every time we stopped by there it was quite busy.
I would recommend if looking for a mid-priced hotel in a central Toronto location - very clean, comfortable and new.
We were given a room with a Jacuzzi in the bathtub.
We asked to be assigned to a room far away from the elevator so we do not have to hear it all night long.
We were given a regular room and when we called to ask to have our room replaced with another Jacuzzi room it took 25 minutes for the front desk to call us back.
They told us there were no other rooms with a Jacuzzi (which was bull on a Wednesday night).
So we decided to use the pool and hot tub instead.
We changed into out suits and tried to figure out where the pool was located.
We called the front desk and they told us the pool was not open yet.
The wallpaper in the bathroom and our room was warped, bubbled, etc.
It was clear this hotel was put up in a rush.
Seriously toast woke us up!
This Hotel was excellent!
Stayed here 3 nights last weekend and I couldn't have asked for anything better.
The rooms were very clean and nice.
The breakfast at the restaurant downstairs was delicious!!
Could you clean a room at 10 so we could have a meeting in it.
If you are looking for a hotel centrally located and no too expensive, this might be your place.
It looked brand new and it was very clean, everything from room to washroom and public hotel spaces.
LCD TV and free internet connection at decent speed were available.
Breakfast too expensive for what you got, even if the cooked food is made upon request.
Try for free the delicious kind of home-made biscuits available all evenings at the front desk (or the fresh fruit in the morning for that matter) and go to grab your breakfast somewhere else.
Gym is very good, and to my surprise, was empty the couple of times I went about.
Spent a long weekend here in November and would return.
The rooms are in excellent condition, housekeeping is very good, and the location is very handy to everything downtown.
I suggest you ask for a room on a high floor as there is a noisy club South of the hotel on the ground floor.
I really enjoyed staying in this hotel.
I only stayed there for one night but the room was very comfortable and clean.
I particularly loved the breakfast they offer where we have a choice of a continental breakfast for $10 +tx or a buffet (all you can eat) for $15 +tx.
I stayed at this hotel on Saturday, November 21st.
The hotel was very nice.
The rooms were fabulous!
We had a room with a king bed and a couch.
Nice finishings, very comfortable bed, beautiful bathrooms.
I was there with three other couples and they also loved the hotel.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone during the week or anyone without a car on the weekend.
My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.
Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for 3 nights in June.
Tell us how you liked the room - Had a 2 queen bed room - very spacious and beds were extremely comfortable.
Food for breakfast was very good with lots to choose from.
Say what you liked best & least - The best part in my opinion was the view of the CN Tower, but not every room will have that - other than that it would have to be the room size and beds.

We always use Hilton famliy hotels, and Hilton Garden Inn is my favorite.
We decided to sleep at the newly opened HGI Toronto Downtown.
The hotel is brand new, fantastic rooms and public areas.
Nice little indoor pool as well.
Breakfast was splendid as usual at Hilton Garden Inn.
The rooms in this hotel are really nice and the front desk staff were very friendly when we checked in.
The indoor pool and hot tub are nice and we had the whole area to ourselves when we went.
The Hotel is very clean, has free WiFi, is well decorated and very comfortable.
The bathroom is large, the shower is great, everything you might expect from a hotel of this category.There are some clubs close, but had no problems with noise, even at the reception.
Hurry, this hotel is what you need in Toronto!
Our room also had 2 queens which was nice since I went with a bunch of dudes.
I know... it also came with a fridge and mircowave.
We basically just wanted something that was close to the night club but we were very pleasantly surprised with the Hilton!
The room was absolutely beautiful!
Hilton gives the impression of being a bit corporate and impersonal, but this hotel is the opposite - small in scale and really, really friendly (or perhaps this is just Toronto).
The rooms are well-equipped and comfortable.
Loved our room.
Whirlpool tub next to the bed with a fireplace.
Breakfast was super.
Will definitely stay there again when visiting Toronto.
The room was great, the only issues we had was with Valet parking and having a room at the front of the hotel.
I was on a business trip and never expected to stay in such a nice hotel.
Loved the in room coffee machine and microwave.
I stayed at the hotel for 3 weeks and next time I'm coming to Toronto I'll ask my hosts to get me a room in Hilton Garden Inn again.
I booked 3 rooms on short notice focusing on being in downtown Toronto.
There were other choices, but I am glad this was our choice given how friendly, confortable and relatively inexpensive it was.
The room was a fairly typical Hilton Garden Inn room, which I like, with great & free high speed access, a fridge that came in very handy and a solid shower and bed.
The rooms were warm and comfortable, and the hotel has a small but cozy lobby with a fireplace, business center and small market shop.
For downtown Toronto, I recommend this property.
We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for New Years Eve.
We chose it because of it's price, location and reviews and we were very happy with our decision.
The room was a decent size, but most importantly it was very clean and nicely updated with granite counter tops.
There was an ipod dock in the room which was nice to have.
The climate control in the room worked extremely quickly to change between different temperatures to keep the room as cool or warm as you like it.
We were looking for a great stay at a comfortable, clean and convenient downtown Toronto hotel and we found it here.
The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the location was very convenient to a lot of major attractions downtown.
My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night last July.
Breakfast was included with the room and it is served on the second floor as a hot buffet breakfast style.
It was not just cereal and toast or muffins.
The room was comfortable, clean and spacious and quiet.
There was a small indoor pool on the second fllor which we used.
It was adequate to do lengths, but not large by any means.
Good size room and extremely comfortable bed.
Breakfast was good and the staff very friendly.
I would be quite happy to stay here again.
After throrough research online, I decided to book Hilton Garden Inn, Peter Street, Toronto.
The room was clean and comfortable...So nice to have that special attention from our room staff...thank you!
It also has a lift for individuals with disabilities to be able to access the hot tub and pool.
The pool itself is just about a perfect size for a downtown hotel...and the water was nice and warm...There really isn't anything more discouraging for a hotel guest than getting ready for the swim, and finding it difficult to get into the pool because the water is too cold...Seems like a little thing, but it's not...This pool was perfect!
We stayed for 2 nights , and spent both evenings at Roy Thompson Hall.... Peter St. intersects with the King Street Car, so we took full advantage of the TTC.
Wonderful time in Toronto...and it all started with the perfect hotel choice...
Loved it!
Had been here for 6 night.
The Hotel is a bit expensive but the rooms are neat and very comfortable.
If you plan to visit this hotel in late march early April, you need to book this hotel well in advance as most of the times the room are fully occupied.
The room was very clean w/ very new furnishings.
We had bed and breakfast rate..food was really good.
Was in Toronto for a friends wedding and they had this hotel listed as a mid-priced option for their guests.
The room was such a pleasant surprise we had booked a standard room and as far as I know that's what we got but we had a beautiful view of the CN tower.
Also the room had a two person whirlpool bath from which you could watch either the TV or the fireplace.
The bed was so comfortable that we fell right to sleep and never noticed any noise from the club.
If you've got to be downtown Toronto I'd recommend this property for sure.
Despite this (and some of the other reviews), I found that the hotel is quiet and I was never disturbed by what is going outside.
We've stayed here at least 5 times, the last being NYE.
Every other time we had no problems, however there are only 2 elevators and they DO take a while, especially that night.
Excellent rooms.
We usually get the 2 queen beds, very spacious, comfortable, clean.
Washroom is big too, lots of counter space (which is handy when you have 4 girls doing their hair and makeup).
A HUGE plus is that there's a microwave and mini-fridge in every room!
Love this hotel, great location ... if you're a group of young people looking for nightlife and shopping (Queen West is right there with a bunch of stores, Chinatown and Kensington is walking distance), definitely give this hotel a shot!
The rooms are equal to anything Hilton offers, the fitness facility is first rate and the restaurant staff are friendly and attentive - to the right degree.
Excellent hotel that hides into an average gray downtown building, standing on an average not important street.
The room has everything you need, good and effective air-condition (important as we had 38Â°C outside), large flat screen 37" TV, fast cable Internet, excellent bathroom.
The king bed was one of the best I ever had.
Comfortable bed, breakfast was ok. Nice view from upper floors.
There was a door between our room and the next one and we felt a little bit uncomfortable, we could hear our neighbours conversations with no effort and they could do the same.
This hotel was clean, convenient and reasonably priced.
We may or may not stay here again.
ROOM: this room was big, with a big bed and couch (pullout).
The room was very clean and modern.
The bed was very comfortable.
The only negative thing I would have to say would be regarding the small size of the bathroom.
The room was a good size with a nice flat screen tv and a really comfortable bed.
In the shower there is a very nice rainfall shower head that feels great to get into after a long day walking around Toronto, especially in the heat!
The best part of the hotel by far though is the breakfast that came with our stay (The Great Escape package).
A full cooked to order breakfast (including omlettes, eggs, waffles, home fries, bacon, sausage, toast, muffin, fruit, etc etc.)
and they encourage you to take whatever you would like from the buffet in a paper bag when you leave!
We recently stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Toronto.
The hotel was beautiful.
The breakfast was much better than I expected.
The room was clean and comfortable with modern decor.
We live in Toronto, so don't stay in Toronto hotels very often.
We were attending a theatre just a 7 minute walk from hotel.
The room was large and very clean.
The shower was one of the best we have ever had at any hotel *anywhere*.
We will stay here again and would recommend this hotel without hesitation.
We stayed at this hotel for a business/pleasure trip.
The beds were firm, but comfortable.
We were very pleased and this hotel will remain with our Toronto file for the next trip.
The room was clean and and the beds are really comfortable.
The room also had a coffee maker and a fridge.
The hotel seem fairly new which is nice.
Really comfy beds and rooms are a good size.
In the bathroom you feel like you are in a space capsule and these are a little cramped but lets face it how much time do you spend in a bathroom...in and out right!
Executive lounge is one of the best of the Hilton chain.
We know all the downtown hotels as we used to live in TO before we moved to the US and this hotel has become one of our favorites for visiting downtown TO.
Many parties going on in hotel with loud music and screaming.
At 10:30 requested we get different room.
Hotel offered lunch and room.
Unfortunately, we made the wrong decision on where to stay.
I like squeaky clean new hotels.
And this is one of them.
They use industrial-style elevators to move your car to lower floors, so trained operators are needed.
Otherwise the room was clean [and cleaned], the fridge and microwave worked too.
Try not to get a room on that side, even high up.
Stayed 3 nights in early June with spouse.
Room was very comfortable, good location for sightseeing in Toronto, breakfasts cooked to order, and all went well until the third night when the nightclub next door went into action.
So, I can recommend the hotel, but please stay on the side where, hopefully, the base beat can't get you.
Two nights we did have a guest, who had orginally intended to attend the conference: despite being assured on the phone that we could add a rollaway for him, when he arrived, we couldn't, and he and my colleague had to split a regular bed.
The Hilton Garden Inn is a good choice for either business or leisure in Toronto.
There is an excellent restaurant in the hotel on the second floor Also on the second floor is a small pool and a very good gym.
The buffet breakfast is really quite good and worth the price if you are hungry.
The rooms are new and well appointed.
You can get a whirlpool room with a fireplace if you are so inclined and the price is pretty much the same as a room without.
The rooms have a small fridge, a microwave oven and a large flat screen television.
Its my new favorite place to stay, you can walk to the Eatons center quite fast and of course Queen St is even closer.
Hotel is brand new, with valet parking, service is exeptional with extra personal touches of the staff remembering you from check in.
Beds were adjustable to firmness and the chairs in the rooms are awsome!
This hotel is very up-to-date with great beds, good-sized rooms, refrigerator and a nice flat screen tv.
Some other folks complained about the noise from the nightclubs in the area.
The rooms and staff are fine.
I'd move rooms or hotels if you plan to sleep.
We stayed here the last weekend in August 2011.
And the bed was terrific!
Breakfast was incredible and the server we had both days called us by name every time she addressed us.
Couldn't find any faults with this hotel.
Great to stay in a new hotel, very clean, lovely furnishings and decor.
Our room was a decent size with a street view from the fifth floor although it would have been great to be higher up for better views.
Lots of thought has gone in to making guests happy, with a huge flat screen TV, very comfy bed, noon check-out, blackout curtains, fridge and fab bathroom with the huge shower/jet enclosure and nice toiletries!
By far the best thing about our stay was the breakfast, we got a great deal as part of our booking through an external site (total $300 inc tax), if bought at the hotel it's around $15.
You could make your own waffles with delicious toppings, huge choice of cereals and pastries, cooked items are made to order so fresh and yummy!
The staff also tell you to take any left over muffins etc away with you when breakfast is closing at 10.
Nice walk down Blue Jays way to harbour area, left out of hotel to great shops on Queen Street.
Right out of hotel and then left on to King St brings you to a great row of bars and restaurants - I recommend Verona italian!
Stayed here two nights while checking out downtown Toronto and it was fine.
We didn't use the hotel for much other than sleeping but we had two good nights sleep and wanted for nothing.
The room is OK, though I vave seen better bedding.
The bathroom is too small.
Breakfast is adequate, nothing impressive.
The hotel seems to be quite new and very clean and comfortable.
There was a business centre, gym and pool, all of which were high quality.
There was a business centre, gym and pool, all of which were high quality.
The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms a very good size.
The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms a very good size.
This hotel was modern, clean and well maintained.
The room was large, the bed was oh so comfortable, the shower was really nice and we liked having a fridge in the room.
It was a bit of a walk to central downtown, but the low price for a hotel room as nice as the larger downtown hotels I have stayed in was well worth it.
We had dinner at Wayne Gretzky's just down the road, and that was really nice.
We stayed at the new Hilton Garden Inn Toronto Downtown for 3 days in July.
We chose the hotel based on the price and location.
The pool and hottub are small, luckily there was only one other person there when we used the facilities.
The room has a refrigerator and microwave.
This place was very nice and brand new.
The rooms where pretty standard and had very comfortable beds.
We stayed her Novemeber 13, 2009. and went out to This is London which was a 2 minute walk for us from the hotel.
My only complaint is that I booked 5 rooms but when I checked in they had spread all the rooms across one floor and we all wanted the rooms side by side with some adjoining.
They did offer us free breakfast which was okay, a little cold but the omelets were really good.
Stayed here Sept. 9th 2011 for two nighfts.
Good hotel with city view rooms.
Room was very clean and the bed very comfotable.
We had complmentery breakfast included which had a lare selection.
The hotel is convenient to all of Torontoâ€™s main attractions and close to the cityâ€™s exciting nightlife.
The rooms are great.
They are very nicely decorated and supper clean.
Everything about this hotel is fabulous !
Couldn't sleep in their wonderful beds !
During the week, it must be a beauitful hotel !!!!!!!
The week-end floozies everywhere and drunken partners are too much !
Stayed here for one night while in Toronto for the Manchester United vs. Celtic match.
Very nice hotel, clean, and helpful staff.
