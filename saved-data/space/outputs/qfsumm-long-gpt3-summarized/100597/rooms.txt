Aspect: rooms
***** Model produced summary *****
The reviews were generally positive, mentioning the cleanliness of the rooms, the comfortable beds, and the spaciousness of the rooms. Some reviewers noted that the hallways had a damp smell. One reviewer was unhappy with their initial room assignment, but was given a different room with a better view.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The rooms are large and quite, you can't hear the planes taking off at the airport next door. The beds are comfortable and large. The bathrooms are mixed, some need cleaner doors and to be renovated, others seem clean and well appointed. The ice and vending machines are close. The coffee machine in the room is appreciated. The lighting was insufficient, and an old basement smell was present sometimes.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
While close to the airport, it was quiet because of thick windows. The beds were large and comfortable with lots of extra pillows. The bathrooms could use some refurbishment. Furnishings were complete with an ottoman, an easy chair, and a coffee maker. A balcony gives a great view of the surrounding city.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
This hotel features very comfortable and spacious rooms, with balcony, coffeemaker, comfortable beds and were well furnished. Some things that need work is the bad lighting, unkempt bathrooms and smell of mildew. All that being said, the rooms are very quiet even though the hotel is close to the airport.

Upon arrival, I requested the same room as previously, if available.
I was informed that entire floor was currently being re-furbished and there were no rooms of that quality available.
Interesting, as the beautiful room I stayed in previously was very new-gorgeous bath and soaking tub.
I can't imagine those rooms would need refurbishing!
I was then given another "Hilton Honors" room.
I arrived to a room on the very ground floor that had a glass door that opened to the outside parking area.
Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.

The room was like staying in a basement, an old and mildew smell.

This hotel is clean, neat and offers good value for the money.
We were wiped out from a long day and wanted to stay in the room for the night and rest.
The hotel has seen its newer days: the carpets are threadbare in some spots and the cement balconies are noticeably empty of furniture.
But the rooms are a great size, and we noticed large groups of flight attendants from various airlines staying there as well.
one time we decided on checking in at the Doubletree.
It's an ok hotel by any other standards but nice compared to what's close by.
Room was an "upgrade" but so far from the elevator.
Would avoid this hotel in the future.
Physically, this is a very tired property.
While renovations appear to be underway according to signs, the hotel infrastructure shows its age.
My room, in the renovated tower, had very insufficient lighting and a bathroom that had seen better days.
Provided amenities (e.g., soap, shampoo) were low quality.
Decided to stay one night by the airport and used priceline to get a room and ended up with the doubletree at a good rate!
The hotel is pretty big but the location next to the airport is great.
I asked for a room in the tower and the room was spacious with a nice king bed and a balcony that overlooked the airport.
There are a few restaurants around the hotel area and you can also easily walk to the airport should you want to.

Bathroom floors seems dirty and needed to be regrouted.
This is a hotel in the Hilton chain and I was disappointed.....:(
This hotel disappointed.
What I found was rather run down and shabby.
The bathroom was dirty and stained.
Carpet was old as were the other furnishings.
This Doubletree is very tired, and more like a 2 star property than a 3 star.
Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.
We opted for the $5 requested upgrade for hhonours members, and the room was superb when we got it.
Lovely spacious Doubletree, with gift shop and a very good restaurant inside it.
We LIKED the fact that it was close to new rapid transit terminal which we chose to take to stadium.
Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room.
Very big, spread out hotel with very reasonable rates and nice rooms, although some are a bit of a convoluted walk from reception.
Lots of air crews use this hotel which has a frequent free shuttle to airport.
We have stayed here a few times and keep coming back because it is good value for money.
Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.
We have stayed at this hotel several times, and others in the area.
This is a good place to stay for a conference or if you need to stay for a night or two near the airport.

We spent one night here before flying out to Alaska.
The room was clean and bed comfortable.
So why would I pay to use it in the room?
Very nice hotel, very close to the airport, walkable in fact to the terminals in less than 10 minutes or one can take a free shuttle bus.
Large spacious lobby, clean comfortable rooms.
All in all, a nice place to stay before or after the flight.
I recently spent 4 nights here.
The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).
But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected.
Overall, if this were MY money, I would NOT stay here.
With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room.
This is a multi story well thought out hotel.
You could safely cross the street at the light and crosswalk and find your self at a diner or several other restaurants.
Our room was large and very comfortable.
Even though we were there for just one night we would recommend this hotel for multiple night say if you are visiting the Seattle, WA area.
Room was typical for a double tree.
Decent size with flat panel TV, and normal size bathroom.
Had a room that faced away from the airport so that helped with the noise.
Slept ok, but the room was quiet.
We left our car for 5 days and stayed in this Doubletree Hotel on our return,our shuttle arrived promptly and we were given a Tower Room .
It was a huge room with great bedding,sheet count & pillows.
This is a pretty rundown hotel.
My room was clean and nice but seemed motel like away from the tower.
At least my room didn't reak otherwise I would of tried to change rooms.
Other than that issue, the hotel is nice and staff was great.
We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied.
Great for those early morning flights, and no worries about traffic jams as Seatac Airport is right across the street.
The rooms are relatively spacious, our kids love the pool, and the breakfast buffet isn't a bad deal for what you get.

The rooms are relatively spacious, our kids love the pool, and the breakfast buffet isn't a bad deal for what you get.
The hotel is clearly old but Hilton has gone to some lengths to make it feel more up-to-date.
It's obviously clean, although the further you get into the maze of halls the more the funky smell of "old" permeates the air.
The room was fairly quiet when other guests weren't talking in the hall.
The bed was quite comfortable and free of bed bugs.
We would certainly use this hotel again as our layover sleeping arrangement on our way to and from vacations.
We had the penthouse suite, 2 rooms with a kitchenette.
The room was done up in buttery soft yellows.
The bathroom was huge.
Larger then some hotel rooms I've stayed in.
It had a sunken in tub, huge walk-in shower, robes & full line of Neutrogena beauty products.
Two flat screen TV's-sitting room w/ leather sofa, tables and chairs.
There was a huge wrap around balcony with a view of the glass elavators and a view of the Cascade Mts.
The bed was so comfy I slept like a baby.
The room was very sound prrof, as I did not hear anyone in the halls or other rooms.
No b-fast was offered.
We ended up at this hotel as our flight home was cancelled.
Room was enormous, with balcony and was spotlessly clean.
This hotel embraces its role as an airport hotel and fufils its purpose very well.
Staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are decent, and it's very close to the airport.
This is an older hotel that has gone through a recent renovation.
Excellent morning breakfasts and the airport shuttle runs every 15 minutes but we have made the 10 minute walk numerous times to the airport terminal.
We live about two hours and a ferry ride from the airport and always stay here when we have an early morning flight.
It is somewhat dated but comfortable enough and the shuttle is very reliable.
We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac.
We stayed here the last night of our trip to Seattle (got it on Priceline for $46 - not bad!).
The bed was very nice, room was clean, we even had a balcony.
Parts of the hotel are laid-out such that it can be difficult to find your room.
The hotel is very close to the airport and sometimes we walk.
The rooms are comfortable and the cookies are great but getting smaller.
We decided to stay here for three nights during our trip to Seattle.
We had a balcony, the beds were super comfortable, room was a good size and clean.
There are restaurants all around, plus two in the hotel.
Great place and would definately stay again.
I've stayed at the Doubletree several times when I need to fly in and out of Seattle.
It's a solid 3* hotel and good value.
Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.
If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
The hotel was fine- a big hotel by the airport.
The hotel is big and busy, so it always feels like there is some commotion going on in the common areas.
The room was nice, comfortable beds, good selection of pillows, nice TV channel selections (was no guide so I had to search for channels).
Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor.
I have also found that requesting rooms at the end of the hall are quieter.
I look forward to returning to this property with my wife and being able to spend more time in the city as well as what the doubletree has to offer!
Arrived late, they had given our room away.
Went to breakfast and got some french toast.
We arrived to the hotel July 23rd.
90 minutes later we still did not have the bed.
We had been told the bed would be sent at 12:00 midnight.
At 1:00AM we were again told the bed would be sent right up.
I talked to the manager on the phone at 1:30AM and he was still full of excuses why we didn't have the bed.
Breakfast was delicious in the coffee shop, hot scones with jam and coffee.
Other restaurants were withing walking distance of the hotel.
But although the room was huge and lavish with two large queens, it was not a place I enjoyed.
No frig or microwaves in Doubletree hotels, too many pillows on the bed.
The room had a large balcony overlooking a lake and on the 4th floor we were up in the trees.
A beautiful hotel for other types of travelers - groups, business people, etc.
This hotel is a nice size and is convenient to the airport and restaurants.
The fitness room is small but the bedrooms are standard.
The hotel gave me 3 vouchers for $10 of any meal since I am a Hilton honors platinum members.
It is an average airport hotel.
Larger than normal rooms do make things more comfortable.
The bathrooms are worn and need updating.
The workout rooms are decent - especially the larger one in Building Five.
We were on the first floor.
Nothing was missing from our room but we were gone for over 10 hours that day and I do not know how long the door was open.
This hotel is by a small lake and at dusk there are misquitos and misc.
I would not recommend this hotel.
We were given a free room upgrade (we are Hilton Honors members).
The room was a bit basic and dated but it was inexpensive and we could leave our car in their car park while we were on holiday.
Easy to reach, very clean and well-appointed rooms.
I was surprised at how nice the rooms were!
The bed was amazingly comfortable.
The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
We really won the gamble with this hotel.
(For the discounted price) The room was very large, faced the airport, but was still quiet.
It even had a balcony!
The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean.
Our room was in the main tower, and was reached by an external elevator with glass walls.
Getting to the room was a fun adventure in itself.
We explored the other areas of this large hotel complex and noticed some rooms were actually are on a small lake, and others overlook the attractive outdoor pool.
I did find the beds comfortable, but very jiggly.
The hotel felt nice enough for a romantic getaway and was a nice treat as a stop-over.
We have stayed at the DoubleTree Seatac more than 15 times, love it.
I suggest getting a room in the tower.
Upgrade to King Corner Room or Penthouse to really treat yourself, balcony are amazing in these rooms.
The hotel room was fine, but I am not sure that this was worth it.
I am a loyal Hilton customer and am glad to get the points but this hotel seems better-suited to guests staying for several days, not for someone who just wants a place to crash before an early flight.
Our family stayed at the Doubletree for one night before flying out to Miami for a Caribbean cruise.
The rooms are a good size, which is a bonus for me as I was traveling with my husband and two large teenaged sons in one room.
We spent a good portion of our early evening at the pool, which has an awesome setting.
We would definitely stay here again when flying out of Seattle!
For an airport hotel, it was surprisingly quiet, rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared, and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous.
A great hotel that I would happily stay again in.
Granted it's a large hotel and I don't like hiking to a room in another zip code.
I always ask for a room near the lobby and am always accomodated.
The rooms in the wings are larger than those in the tower and if you get wings 2 or 3 closer than walking to the tower wing plus no elevator hassle.
The rooms are always clean, the beds great, bedding and bath linens top notch.
They recently have gone to flat sceen televisions throughout the place which was overdue but is greatly appreciated.
I'm always pleased when my Priceline bid results in the Doubletree
This room was one of the most comfortable rooms I've stayed at in a long time.
Cushy bed, flat screen tv, great water pressure.
Room was quiet and the shuttle to the airport runs 24 hours.
We stayed here for 1 night in August since we had an early flight the next morning.
The elevators for the tower are not close.
t was a very long walk to get to the room.
The room itself was nice but not for $200.00 per night.
There was mildew in the bathroom-cleanliness was fair.
Our room was nice and clean and on the back side (away from street traffic), plus only heard planes when we has the sliding door opened.
We didn't have a chance to use the pool, although enticing.
We would gladly stay here again!
Before departing to New York, we stopped overnight in Seattle and stayed at this hotel after scoring a great deal from Priceline.
The hotel is huge and they give you warm cookies once you check-in.
I've stayed here a couple of times.
The rooms are clean and nicely appointed.
Had a huge mirror in the bathroom that was well light around the edges.
Wolfgang Puck coffee was available for the in room coffee maker, My room was in the tower on the 8th floor and had a balcony.
Rooms large and comfortable.
On a recent US trip we probably stayed in about 10 hotels and this one wouldn't rank in the top 20!
This is a very large and confusingly laid out hotel.
When we found our room we discovered that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and there were dirty towels lying around.
We had decided to go with this hotel to save a small amount of money and as a change from the Cedarbrook lodge we had stayed in a couple of weeks before.
On the basis of this experience I will never choose a Doubletree hotel again.
We stayed 3 days at the Doubletree Hotel in July 2006.
Too bad considering the hotel facilities are lovely and the rooms are comfortable and spacious.
I would not stay at a Doubletree Hotel again.
After a miserable day at Sea-Tac, we thought the Doubletree would be heaven.
The crappy wings are old and the rooms smell musty.
Rooms are not particularly posh or large.
Ours was kind of dingy, definitely in need of a remodeling.
My wife and I stayed only 1 night before flying out of Sea-Tac the next morning.
Hotel was fine for our purposes, but I wouldn't have wanted a longer stay there.
Beds were very comfortble .
Pool and whirlpool were nice, but would prefer 24 hr.
Room service was typically expensive .
The room room's AC was working fine and it was pretty quite.
So overall you get what you pay for.
We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased.
The rooms were very spacious, modern and clean.
I would highly recommend the Doubletree and plan on staying here again on our next trip.
We had a double queen room in the tower, looking out towards the mountains.
The room was quiet, very comfy beds and we enjoyed the view from the 10th floor; the room and hallways could use an update, but are perfectly adequate.
The tower rooms do have balconies but the space is shared with the room next door and divided by a set of austere looking bars--plus there is no furniture to sit on so the balconies are not really functional.
I am told there are good Thai and BBQ restaurants within walking distance across the street.
Hotel pool is outside, heated to a nice temp and there is a hot tub nearby with a nice seating area all around.
I stayed one night at this hotel, as we were flying out early the next morning.
The hotel was nice; good clean rooms.
Overall, it was a nice hotel, if you are prepared to pay for it.
This is a huge hotel.
Clean rooms, comfortable bed.
The room was very clean, cozy and very quiet even though it was so close to the airport.
The hotel it's self was huge, but yet it still felt very comfortable.
It has that "west-coast" feel to it with lots of wood and glimpses of green forrest outside.
The beds were amazing.
We will definately stay here again.
We needed a hotel near the airport for just one night, and selected the Doubletree.
The room was spacious with a comfortable bed and a large selection of various pillows.
There was a good TV, and nice bathroom with thick towels and plenty of hot water.
Every room seemed to have a balcony.
Our balcony looked over the pool enhanced with mature Pacific Northwest landscape.
It was very suitable to the geography, and we did not have that feeling that we were just in any big hotel in any big city.
Nonetheless, we will certainly stay at this hotel when we return to Seattle again.
The room we stayed in was beautiful!
Newer furniture, very comfortable bed with nice linens, two large sink areas and super clean.
Located within a few miles of Sea-Tac this is a very large hotel with a Starbucks, gift shop, meeting rooms, breakfast room, bar and dining room.
However it was good enough.
I had a spacious and clean suite with fridge, microwave, nice sized table and a comfortable bed.
The walk out balcony was a nice surprise.
Nice pool and fitness areas.
We stayed at this hotel one night before an Alaska cruise.
The breakfast in the restaurant was amazing, and the staff was very attentive and friendly.
The room was very clean and comfortable.
We would highly recommend this hotel for before and after cruising because it is minutes from the airport and is lovely.
Used points, so I don't know the regular room rate.
Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport.
Details... GOOD: --Rooms, in the tower where we stayed, are pretty decent.
Plenty big, nicely kept bathrooms, bed was fairly comfy.
--Restaurant staff seemed to be overwhelmed during breakfast, so they fell behind a bit.
--The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
--The doors to the rooms have a huge gap at the bottom - allows a lot of light and sound in from the hallway.
Love that the hotel provided a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, every 15-20mins.
The Hotel was clean, great staff, was greeted with hot fresh cookies at the check-in counter.
My husband was hoping there was an indoor pool, but the pool was warm, and the hot tub was awesome.
Pool hours was morning until 11pm.
My room was very easy to find, but I know others had some difficulties finding their rooms.
Even though the hotel was close to the airport, you couldn't haer the planes taking off, it was quiet and very relaxing.
Slept like a baby...very comfortable beds.
After this stay we will only stay here in the future when at Seatac.
The hotel itself is very nice, we were given a very recently updated room in the tower.
The beds were very comfortable, room large enough for wheelchair, and bathroom clean.
It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
I asked for a room in their Tower, but was told that Priceline customers had to pay a ten dollar a night premium, which I GLADLY paid.
But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
It's NO three star hotel at all.
Priceline should be ASHAMED of rating it up with the Hilton SEATAC, where I was placed on the first night.
The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare.
We stayed one night here before our flight home and I wish we had stayed here longer!
The rooms were gorgeous and spacious and comfortable.
For $5 we got an upgrade to a family suite - which has 2 connecting rooms, 2 sinks AND a full bath.
The pool was huge and gorgeous.
This was cheaper than the hotel we stayed at downtown and I think in the future I would look for places like this outside the city and get a rental car to drive into the city.
This was a great hotel.
The rooms were very clean and the staff was very nice.
The swimming pool looked nice but we didn't get the chance to swim.
We had dinner in the bar area.
It was a long ackward walk to our room.
The room was okay, but not as clean as one would expect.
I will not stay in a Doubletree again.
We stayed here for a couple of nights at the start of our US vacation.
We had a large room very clean and well furnished.
Breakfast was good and the staff were very helpful.
Room was spacious and clean.
Nice size bath.
I stayed in this hotel for 1 day, as a side trip from Vancouver.
The hotel interior itself is a bit outdated, but the room we stayed in (in the tower) was very pleasant, relaxing and modern.
I actually miss the beds!
I will definitely stay here again when I visit Seattle.
