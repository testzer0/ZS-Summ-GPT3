***** Sentences in Cluster ****
I stayed at the Marriott in mid-June for one night on a business trip.
The issue I had is that the phone system in some of the rooms was not functioning when I checked in.
The front desk clerk told me about it, and said the hotel would pay for a calling card for me if I wished to make calls.
I tried to hook up my computer to the internet in the room afterwards, but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue.
I called the customer service person (with my cell phone!)
The customer service person was quite apologetic and told me that she would see what she could do.
I thought that the service response was great - I have never had someone come to my room to hand me another key.
The staff was absolutely wonderful both at the front desk and especially in the breakfast area.
All very friendly and eager to please.
What made it even more special was that they sent up to the room chocolate dipped strawberries and drinks along with a anniversary card signed by each member of thier team.
The only slight knock I have is that the airport shuttle doesn't stop at this hotel.
When I stay here, I generally take the shuttle to the Delta Chelsea, then walk the couple of blocks to this hotel (and enter off Bay).
Convenient to transportation.
Called down twice, still no cots, finally my husband had to go down to complain at desk, finally 20 minutes later got both of the cots.
Staff very helpful.
Dissapointed since this is suppose to be a 5 star establishment.
The service was exceptional, the beds VERY comfortable and the room is really nice size.
The staff were courteous and helpful, and the sports bar on the first floor was a great place to hang out.
The check in staff were nice for the most part.
Internet connection in room rather pricey.
The service at the Mariott was wonderful for the duration of our stay.
They had personal-size packs sent up to our room both days we were there.
Room service was not over-priced and it took about half an hour for our dinner to arrive on the Saturday evening, when we were too lazy to venture out for a meal.
All staff that we dealt with were courteous and professional.
I stayed in this Marriott for 3 nights when in Toronto on business.
The internet costs $16 per day and it's wired only, although this also includes long distance calls to the USA.
This adds up for someone who needs to be connected.
Tip - the Toronto Airport Express shuttle bus is a cost-effective mode of transport from the airport to the city.
However the bus driver pointed out that the U. of Toronto Residence stop (the last stop) was much closer, just a very short walk between some buildings to arrive at the hotel.
Internet is for a fee of $16 per day for wired or wireless in room.
Reception and checkin staff are flawless and will help you with anything youay need.
I do not often give hotels 5 stars, but In this cars, it was not the physical structure, that is so good, but he hotel staff that shines.
The staff took care of all ours needs and requests with enthusiasm and the concierge even went so far as recommend vineyards to visit for our side trip to Niagra wine country.
They arranged rental car service for us as well as airport transport.. All very reasonably priced and on time.
It's a quick ride from the airport, and the bus lets you off at the Metropolitan Hotel about 2 short blocks away.
Be aware, though--you will be the first stop on the way back and travel time will be a little over an hour.
Every interaction I had with the staff was perfect.
I was disappointed with the Internet service, though: $15 + $3 service charge daily, from noon to noon, with some interruptions.
Great service, friendly staff, good food - pity the room wiater couldn't go further than the threshold !!!!

And David and Paul the Concierges were very knowledgable and nothing was too much trouble..

No free internet in the rooms just in the Concierge Lounge.
Our housekeeper was excellent and expressed her appreciation for the tip we left.
I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
Maybe this is common?
Well, after 45 minutes, no one showed up so I called the desk again.
They said "he" was called and must be busy.
We waited another 20 minutes before anyone came.
The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all".
This time the clerk did manage a sorry, but it was forced.
Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff.
Lots to do here as well, check the information center.
The staff are good.
The Staff were great and very helpful.
But hotel staff did their best to help.

The service has always been excellent.
The bell staff (usually women) would handle this for us cheerfully.
I would often try to tip them, sometimes $20, but they always refused, stating that it was against hotel policy and that it was "part of the service".
This really annoys me, enough that I will not stay there again in spite of the excellent service.
The front desk girl didn't seem to understand the situation and said "oh there is a shoppers 2 blocks from here."
She still didn't get it- and said-"well I'll call to see if it is open".
finally another employee came by and I stopped hi a dn asked if he could help me.
He was sooo helpful and got my a few bandaids in less than a minute.
Staff was confused as to the concierge lounge, but that was it.
My husband traveled to Toronto for business constantly for a few months this past summer and we made a vacation of a couple of weekends in the city.
The staff were brilliant with our little boy and the bar/bistro was lovely.
The room service is always on time and tastey...I highly recommend this hotel.
I should note that the Airport Express bus does not list the Marriott as one of its downtown stops, however one of its stops (the Metropolitan Hotel) is only a block or so from the Marriott.
Hotel staff seemed to be competent and very pleasant, although my interactions with them were minimal.
Front desk staff were not the friendliest...common to big cities perhaps?

concierge was fairly helpful, front desk staff was prompt and helpful.
From the concierge and front desk staff, everyone was very nice and attentive during our stay.
My only quibble would be that the business centre charged $3 for 5 minutes of computer time, but if you brought your own laptop, you could use it for free in the lobby.
All the hotel staff were friendly and courteous.
All in all, a very successful business trip by day and very comfortable nights at the Marriott.
The staff was great right from check-in with a "welcome back" from every employee starting with the valet.
I am an avid business traveller and stop in Toronto quite often.
For business use the hotel gets a C, it was a poor service compared to the others.
The rest of my stay was great but definately need to get a new system in place for business travellers.. Id recommend Hilton Downtown or Marriott Airport Locations for Business Trips.

They quickly cancelled the 2nd reservation once they realised the situation, no questions asked.

They charged us 17 Dollars for the internet a day.. which would have been fine had there been a fast wifi connection or multiple ethernet connections in the room.
Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.

Every hotel worker we encountered was friendly and helpful.
The people at the front desk were more than willing to help us out with what we needed.
One is my usual complaint of charging the exhorbitant fees for internet access in the guest rooms...this drives me crazy that I can go to a Holiday Inn Express and get free wireless internet in my room but the higher end hotels charge for it.
No free business center to print boarding passes, etc...pc's in business center charged almost $2 per minute!!
Okay, enough on that rant.
