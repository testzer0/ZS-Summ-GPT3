***** Sentences in Cluster ****
Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler.
Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing.
The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet!
They would leave dirty glasses and leave new ones and they did not change the sheets.
FRONT DESK: Members of the front desk staff were extremely rude and condescending!!
Messages are not sent to the manager but rather put to the side.
We finally spoke to one front desk manager who compensated us for one nights stay because of our troubles.
As previous review on Hilton Bentley this seems to be a policy throughout the Miami area.
Other travellers we spoke to experienced the same.
Bar service at busy times was a little haphazard - incorrect orders although they did make amends for errors.
We felt that an establishment of this nature in this location and carrying the Hilton brand should have made staff available to man the lounge at the times stated.
We had our payment receipts and confirmations in hand and had also called in advance to confirm before arriving.
On the upside the manager bought us dinner and drinks at the restaurant for our inconvenience at check-in and he was very apologetic and nice.
The food at the restaurant was excellent and the service was great.
For the most part the staff was very professional and on top of their job.
There was a male bartender that in my opinion was very rude, unprofessional and obviously doesnâ€™t like his job, but that was my only negative encounter.
We didn't rent a car upon arrival, but met a really nice cab driver who took us everywhere we wanted to go for the whole time we were there.
I found the hotel staff to be very welcoming and accommodating.
I called the front desk, they responded, but little control over the situation.
Clean and spacious,everybody is very polite and helpfull.
Excellent customer service.
In this case, it was the staff that made the event run smoothly.
Each of the staff we had interactions with were very helpful.
I am on business and an $8 cab ride to downtown.
The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.
The one issue i must stress is do not--I repeat--do not take the overhead train cars to or from the hotel area after 6pm.
Regardless of what you are told it is not safe for anyone.
If you don't know the system you will go around in circles and the cars are invested with local hoodlums and drunks.
Do not wander off the main strip!
I complained to the "manager" and she told me that it was "their culture".
I was delighted to be upgraded to Executive Level something I don't think Starwood or IC Hotels do when using points.
Service was friendly and on top of things.
We asked for Towels - 5 minutes later they were there We had room service - said it would take 25 minutes - was there in 15 We needed more pillows - there in 10 minutes Housekeeping was a pleasure and our room was always made up early.
The staff was accommodating and friendly.
Friendly stuff.
I enjoyed staying here but I don't understand why there isn't free internet like in all other hotels I stayed in during my 3-week vacation.
Free internet is available only in lobby downstairs and if you want internet in your room, you have to pay for it.
That's a big MINUS.
Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards.
When we tried to get answers, he waved his hands in our face and dismissed us and told us to talk to someone else in the morning.
The front desk guy was nice enough to give us a room facing the bay after we requested it although what they had available was on the 4th floor.
Another positive was the free internet service in the lobby (they had 3 computers you could use as well as wireless if you had a laptop) We were also able to avoid paying the $28 parking fee by parking across the street at a meter and then making sure we moved our car in the morning.
People was very nice to me there, specially in the front desk where I was told about all amenities.
At night and in the morning service was excellent in the concierge lounge attended by Luis who did a great job.
As the hours wore on, I became increasingly agitated with United Airlines which could not confirm with certainty the location of my bag or when it would be delivered.
I called often and continued to get unsatisfactory answers.
It could have been there 10 minutes or 10 hours, who knows--a bellman had accepted delivery and never reported it to anyone.
I was so happy to have the bag and reported back to the chief concierge, Yasser, what had happened so maybe someone else wouldn't have this same mix up.
He escorted me to the shuttle, heard me out, talked to the bellmen and was extremely kind.
The service overall is excellent.
The rooms are really nice and clean and the staff is amazing.
Excellent service.
I spent 2 nights here for a business trip.
The staff upgraded us to larger room, with a terrific view of the downtown and port.
The staff is very friendly and they always remember me.
Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls.
Coming from Europe, it takes some time to get used to the "rip me off at every corner" culture in the States, but this was just going too far.
Phone - don't go near it.
Valet service is god awful.
There Is a dedicated attendant in a booth working but she doesn't pick up her phone...what's the point.
Then when I got my car 10 minutes later the attendent just handed me my keys and walked away...a total joke.
You need to take an elevator to get to the registration.
I will be back on business in Miami soon and am damn sure I'm not staying here.
Within 5 minutes of arriving, three different employees greeted and welcomed our family .
We needed extra pillows and towels - to our room in 10 minutes with a smile.
Folks, I travel often and certainly know the difference between hiding quality service and providing quality service.
I suggest the cab.
Both nights the same three staff members have been on duty.
The service is unbelievably slow.
On both nights my husband has had to get up and deliver our orders directly to the bartender.
We go out and we travel a lot - this service was just plain bizarre.
The staff were very friendly from the moment we reached there to the moment we left.
I have never come across such friendly staff!
We arrived there after a very long flight from Ireland and we were delighted to have such a fast check in and such friendly service.
All you need to do is hop on the bus or metromover which is almost outside the door!
There were always taxi's at the hotel also that could bring us on a five minute trip to the beach!!
The next day they compt our snack after explaning it all to the front desk people.
Watch out for the unfortuneates in our society.
Second, my husband and I are both businesspeople, and to get wireless internet in our room, we were EACH charged $9.99 a day, even though their materials all say "wireless internet in your room for only $9.99 a day."
What they should say is per computer.
Due to on-site construction, elevator service was horrible.
Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all.
I was on a weeklong business trip and attended a training program.
Cab ride to South Beach was $15.
Wireless internet access is $9.95 which isn't bad by most comparisons.
The staff was great.
The room was really clean, the hotel facilities were very good and the views from the room were amazing, we could not fault the service and the breakfast, everything was presented well.
We found that here.
Every staff person we encountered was friendly & helpful.
If you're visiting the med school, it's supposedly only 2.5 miles away - but it took me nearly half an hour to deal with the miami traffic - so either familiarize yourself the night before OR leave early enough to address the bumper to bumper traffic.
As I was only there for one night I didn't utility all the services the hotel had to offer.
The lady at the nice enough to give my daughter an OJ even though it wasn't normally offered for snacks and only for breakfast.
Everytime we ran into someone they always saluted us.
For example, I was told by the front desk that I needed to go down to the transportation office in order to book the shuttle to the cruise terminal.
When I got downstairs to the motor lobby there was no one at the transportation office.
The bell captain noticed I looked confused and asked me what I needed.
I told him I needed a shuttle to the cruise terminal for 12 people for 11AM the next morning.
He told me that no one was at the transportation office but he took my room number and told me he would have a shuttle for me at the time requested.
The Bell Captain recognixed me as I got off the elevator, got all of our luggage together and got us oon our way in our shuttle.
I the hotel business sometimes the HOSPITALITY piece is forgotten.
The service was the best!!
The staff were all pleasant and helpful, especially Bell services that made several dining recommendations.
The staff were friendly and helpful, and the lobby and bars downstairs were very relaxing and we did spend alot of time there.
When we travel, we like to walk around the area/city and enjoy the sights.
Downtown did not feel safe at all, and there were alot of unsavoury looks as we did walk 4 blocks from the Hotel.
We soon turned around, went back and called a taxi to take us where we wanted to go.
Anyway the staff had been wonderful and tried immediatly to fix it.
The staff were pretty friendly and warm especially the bellboys and front desk officials.
Someone was at our door within 5 minutes.
Front desk staff very courteous and professional.
The staff is extremely nice and always finding ways to go the extra mile...
The staff here were more than excellent.
My colleague and I both received excellent service.
The OMNI trainstation was only a block away.
Taking the train toward downtown is free and a five minute ride to the famous Bayside Marketplace --- which is a must do!
Taxi brought us to South Beach and the terminals within 15mins and there will always be taxi.
Hotel stuff are very helpful.
So then I contacted Corporate offices, and I was informed that the manager already stated that he sent a apology to me (LIES).
I had to chase down an apology.
I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami.
I liked the comfort of the beds, the flow of water in the shower, and the helpfulness of the staff, but that is pretty much it.
It lacks a new television sets.
The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in.
I stayed here one night on business, enjoying the $89/night rate they were advertising on their web site.
All the staff members I encountered were more than friendly and attentive.
Really, very hospitable.
And they sent someone up to move me and didn't make me haul my luggage all the way downstairs again.
Overall, nice place to stay if you are in town on business.
Thanks to Anthony at the front desk who managed to get us a room with a great view for my partners birthday.
Service was good, nothing to complain about.
Everything there were great from the nice clean and comfortable room with the unbelievable pretty view until the good food, the great bar and pool etc and last but not least the helpful friendly and sympathetic staff especially the ladjh in the little shop and the men called fernando at the front desk, he'd done a well work, gave good advices and was very cordially,smart, professional with a nice charisma and left behind a positive impression!
so I would like to say thx to all staff and especiall to fernando for this great service, that's one of the reason why we will come again soon... it was the first and definitely not the last time.
Traveled to Miami in January for business and stayed at the Hilton Downtown because the conference was being held at the same hotel.
I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
Fridge didnt work Staff was rude and all spanish speaking.
Staff lied that the bus system of Miami was very difficult to use when in fact it was more inexpensive and a lot easier than getting around w/ a taxi.
The staff were unhelpful.
I spoke to several managers including Humberto several times.
I also copied the Hilton executive team and did not receive a response form them.
I will be not be staying at this hotel again and if you want a good nights sleep at a hotel with a friendly staff I recommend you don't either.
The staff was extremely helpful and attentive.
Just stayed here for business.
Had to move rooms, but was upgraded to a suite and my room service was comped.
Very nicely handled by front desk staff.
Other than that all was well, staff was friendly.
Pros: friendly staff, clean rooms
Wish to point out the excellent service I and my guests have enjoyed in the dining room from the manager in charge Mr Avi Zarchi and his team.
Very polite and very professional approach.
I feel the housekeeping staff is totaly at fault, and needs better supervision.
Luckily, due to the fact that internet access is pricey otherwise.
The staff was always friendly and helpful.
I even asked a random employee about towels poolside & he was more than happy to help even though it's not technically his job.
$25 taxi from Miami airport.
They just said they ran out.
Give it 4 out of 5 for location, but 2 out of 5 for service.
Room service trays stayed in corridors for 2 days.
After about 5 minutes, I was helped.
Front desk staffer was very nice, saw that I was a Hilton Honors Gold member and quickly informed me of the complimentary welcome reception and breakfast at the executive lounge.
The upgrade was very much appreciated.
I used to live right next to this hotel and was very impressed with the service and the accommodations.
VERY clean and tidy The staff was great, courteous, and friendly.
Would honestly give 3.5 but 3 is a bit low.
Staff were real helpful and friendly, no faults there.
Loved Angelina who served us every night in the lounge bar!
Not impressed.
They do nothing but assist in the situation.
They ask for your business card and e-mail address it doesn't matter if you are from out of town or not.
The room was spacious and bathroom clean with great views over the bay and the breakfast was awesome, the staff throughout the hotel were very polite and helpful.
I wouldn't venture by foot very far here after dark - not there's much around.
Pretty safe if you stay on Biscayne.
Compares well to the Hyatt in the room, although the Hyatt personal service is superior.
They also had a business center with free internet access for guests, so we were able to check our flight info, which was a big help.
Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
Phone did not work in room.
The guy who came said it was the city's problem and left.
