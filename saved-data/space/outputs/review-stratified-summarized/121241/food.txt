***** Sentences in Cluster ****
We had a coffeemaker in the room but did not use it as there was a small coffee/tea bar just down the hall.
The women said that maybe she might allow a plastic bottle of soda or water but for sure no beer.
they did reduce it to $98.00 difference in priginal price.
With having a Silver Dollar City season pass the price was very afforadable.
never saw it...oh unless they mean the old fruit on the table with the juice.
The places we had dinner "Montana Mikes" and " Florentina's" were both really good food and great service.
I booked this with travelocity, around 50 per night.
Only in the price.
For the price we paid it was just fine!
my wife found some food on the floor from the previous occupants while trying to plug in the computer.
$45/nt.
But if the price is right - why complain?
Canned peaches made up the fruit area and the eggs were very mysterious.
They have scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, waffles, hot and cold cereal, and even donuts!
There is also a variety of beverages.
Again we had a pricing issue we had a reservation conformation for one price and the clerk that checked us in would not honor it AT ALL.
The water was shut off for about four hours and that messed up the pools chorine and they were shut down for one night.
My son found a long hair in his pancake.
The coffee does need to be a little bit stronger but that's all.
or they didnt check the sheets and blankets!
The price was very good and they had made improvements in the short 5 weeks between trips.
Overall, we couldn't beat the price for the location and helpfulness of the staff, but I expect our rooms to be cleaner and everything well-stocked & in working order.
The price was great.
For the location and breakfast, it was priced well.
They had biscuts and gravy, waffle stations, cereal, bagels, toast, oatmeal, donuts, juice, milk, and coffee.
The waffles were great, as were the donuts.
Not too many healthy options, but they did have oatmeal.
The price was unbeatable, the staff was helpful, and the breakfast (Which was included) was fantastic!
The price was right and our room was first class.
Good price with coupon from MWTravelBuddy.com .
