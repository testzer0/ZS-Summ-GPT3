[0.12493515014648438] I couldn't believe they were trying to stick me for a charge when I hadn't been able to park in the garage, the spot was supposed to be free, the spot was recommended by the hotel staff, AND my car was broken into while parked there.

[0.6873035430908203] First impression, it was in a decent area, not too far from the central part of downtown with all the restaurants and I thought ok, not too bad.
[0.521209716796875] Our room was good, the bed very good - but it was disappointing to find that the "new and exciting Primrose Restaurant and Bar where no expense had been spared" (according to their brochure) was CLOSED except for breakfast time.
[0.23976898193359375] There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.

[0.75433349609375] Some reviewers mentioned that it was a bit expensive to park at the hotel.

----- Supporting -----

[0.75433349609375] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.02419757843017578] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.003360748291015625] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.001880645751953125] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.0018033981323242188] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.

[-0.049854278564453125] The best thing about the room was its view.
[-0.03929901123046875] The window looking at a fantastic view north was so grimy it was hard to see through (finger and nose prints all over it) We just kept the net curtains closed so we couldn't see them and enjoyed the night lights instead.
[-0.036594390869140625] This is not to complain about Tim Hortons in any way, but were were dissapointed of the "limited" menu they have had there.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9486160278320312] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.9199161529541016] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.8572225570678711] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.7062129974365234] The ramps are very steep, the spots are narrow and the driving room is almost non-existent.
[0.7005176544189453] I did not trust the underground parking facilities so made sure to bring all my bags and valuables up to my room.

[0.6549072265625] I couldn't believe they were trying to stick me for a charge when I hadn't been able to park in the garage, the spot was supposed to be free, the spot was recommended by the hotel staff, AND my car was broken into while parked there.
