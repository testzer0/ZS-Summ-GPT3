[0.8803844451904297] There were complaints about the lack of amenities in the business center.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8803844451904297] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.
[0.04071044921875] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.0175933837890625] I had called down to front desk to ask for some extra towels and they were giving me a hard time.
[0.0094451904296875] The front desk staff were very unfriendly and always seemed to make matters overly complicated.
[0.00628662109375] hair bath front desk staff unhappy and helpless.

[-0.7114782333374023] There was also a business room where you could enjoy free internet and use of the fax and printer.
[-0.611907958984375] When I complained about the elevators and wireless he just stood there with no apology or good explanation other than it would be too expensive to fix the elevators and it was all the guests' fault anyway for the elevator getting stuck since there were 8 people in the elevator (it's rated for 12 people).
[-0.5862998962402344] The staff were very friendly and cheery and the kids also liked the Tim Hortons in the lobby for the donuts.
[-0.5047111511230469] Again, this is in no way to complain about the quality of service or Tim Hortons, just heads up for fellow travellers.
[-0.47227001190185547] We were very pleased with the service and the meeting space.
