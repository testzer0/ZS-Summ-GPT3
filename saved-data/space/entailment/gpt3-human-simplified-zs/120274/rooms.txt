[0.1717376708984375] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.

[0.9540872573852539] I had a fantastic room with a kitchenette paying only £15/night (booked through an English travel agent).
[0.9419431686401367] When we got to our room, we were suprised to see they upgraded us to a room with a kitchenette.
[0.9357900619506836] When we first arrived, our first impression was, great and when we got into the room it was even better as we had a fridge, microwave & Tea & Coffee facilities (We did how ever pay extra for this pleasure of about £1 a day.)

----- Supporting -----

[0.9624824523925781] But we didn't have any kitchen equipment in our room like some others have mentioned.
[0.9599170684814453] The motels website states that fridges are in the room, but there was not one to be seen.
[0.9483428001403809] There is no fridge in the room, there is no coffee in the room, the safe in the room doesn't work.
[0.9325275421142578] The fridge and microwave are not available in 'standard' rooms.
[0.9106540679931641] All in all i would stay there again but would request having a fridge as all of the rooms do not have them and the ice machine played up alot.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.20333099365234375] Also, the hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast.
[-0.19439697265625] Theres lots of restaurants very close.. a steak house, TGI fridays, outback, subway etc etc.. and a supermarket aswell which was handy.
[-0.173583984375] Three types of cereal, toast and waffles to eat, milk, coffee and juice.
[-0.1566162109375] My only complaint would be the continental breakfast.
[-0.14239501953125] So, on balance, yes, it's cheap if you're on a big budget but, when you balance it all up, unless you're ok with roughing it a bit, you might want to consider paying a few mpore dollars and going for something a little more up-market.

[0.9703788757324219] The room interior was recently decorated and in a style similar to most US motel rooms with two large queen sized beds, air conditioner mounted at the window and came with safe, refrigerator and microwave.

[-0.9124336242675781] Also the room would benifited from a fridge as we could not keep our water and drinks cold.

[0.1246023178100586] Room has air con which is noisy.
[0.03539276123046875] First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.

[0.85968017578125] Continental breakfast was a little boring, could use more variety, but it was ok none the less.
[0.5800247192382812] There is a light breakfast served every morning - cornflakes, toast and coffee - which is again ok but nothing special.
[0.5528640747070312] We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.
[0.5267086029052734] Admittedly, it's not much: donuts, toach, muffins, juice, cereals ... but it's enough if you aren't big breakfast eaters, and are getting up early to hit the theme parks.
[0.34900474548339844] The breakfast is plain cereal, toast coffee and juice but we wouldn't want more than that anyway.

[0.0273590087890625] Let's just say...when you stay in a hotel, the minute you walk in to your room you shouldn't feel like you need to check the sheets and look under the mattresses first before you bring your luggage in - but for this place I definitely did.
[0.008304595947265625] It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!
[0.0057430267333984375] We simply needed a safe, clean place (our room was somewhat clean we helped it out a bit) to drop our stuff and lay our heads at night for 2 weeks.

[0.6200714111328125] We had breakfast every morning and although basic it was ok. We booked our Universal Studio tickets here and got a very good deal.
[0.5180206298828125] We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.
[0.3422393798828125] Breakfast room is a little small for the number of guests, and resulted in a scrum every morning, but the breakfast itself is adequate to start the day.
[0.34075927734375] The breakfast is plain cereal, toast coffee and juice but we wouldn't want more than that anyway.
[0.1791534423828125] The breakfast was decent - not as good as I've had at other hotels, but it was free so one shouldn't complain :) The location is awesome, about 15 minutes to Disney and almost within walking distance from some nice restaurants.

[0.7867927551269531] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.
[0.7817726135253906] 3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .
