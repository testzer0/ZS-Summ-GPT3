[0.6966476440429688] First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.

[0.2840576171875] To sum up, ok accomodation if you only want somewhere reasonably clean to sleep (and the free breakfast is a good cost saver).
