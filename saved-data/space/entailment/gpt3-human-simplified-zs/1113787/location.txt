[0.2890777587890625] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[0.15240478515625] We were disappointed about the hours of the Charlie Palmer and the bar downstairs but found an outstanding place to get a drink directly across the street.
[0.064483642578125] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.0105133056640625] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
