[0.48688507080078125] We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied.
[0.4755363464355469] We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac.
[0.42945098876953125] Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport.
[0.3505439758300781] We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased.
[0.34113311767578125] Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9879288673400879] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.9835071563720703] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[-0.97930908203125] To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.
[-0.9646234512329102] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).
[-0.9602842330932617] This hotel disappointed.

[-0.18192291259765625] I was informed that entire floor was currently being re-furbished and there were no rooms of that quality available.
[-0.178466796875] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.3936290740966797] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
[-0.3496055603027344] My room was very easy to find, but I know others had some difficulties finding their rooms.
[-0.2812519073486328] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[-0.25626564025878906] --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
[-0.2285747528076172] The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare.

[0.33319854736328125] Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.

[0.933232307434082] (For the discounted price) The room was very large, faced the airport, but was still quiet.
[0.8722457885742188] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.

[-0.2230844497680664] I have also found that requesting rooms at the end of the hall are quieter.
[-0.19544696807861328] The room was fairly quiet when other guests weren't talking in the hall.
[-0.18350982666015625] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.

[0.7179737091064453] The room was quiet, very comfy beds and we enjoyed the view from the 10th floor; the room and hallways could use an update, but are perfectly adequate.

[0.9755573272705078] The rooms at the hotel have spacious.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9755573272705078] Too bad considering the hotel facilities are lovely and the rooms are comfortable and spacious.
[0.9405288696289062] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.77508544921875] Granted it's a large hotel and I don't like hiking to a room in another zip code.
[0.7015476226806641] The rooms are relatively spacious, our kids love the pool, and the breakfast buffet isn't a bad deal for what you get.

[0.807586669921875] Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room.

[-0.9808616638183594] Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.

[0.4437408447265625] Interesting, as the beautiful room I stayed in previously was very new-gorgeous bath and soaking tub.
[0.3748931884765625] The hotel interior itself is a bit outdated, but the room we stayed in (in the tower) was very pleasant, relaxing and modern.

[-0.8571243286132812] We had dinner in the bar area.
[-0.8312530517578125] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
