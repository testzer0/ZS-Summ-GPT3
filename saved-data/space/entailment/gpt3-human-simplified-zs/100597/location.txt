[0.6424140930175781] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[0.1622314453125] It is an easy drive into downtown Seattle from here and worked great for my late-arriving flight before meetings in Seattle the following morning.
[0.022035598754882812] This hotel was within a stone's throw of Sea-Tac airport and right next to the off-site Thrifty car rental lot, so for location, it was great.
[0.013772010803222656] The hotel is conveniently located, just across the street from the airport entrance with a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes.

[-0.303680419921875] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
[-0.2543754577636719] Confusing layout.
[-0.2332611083984375] This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking.

[0.8832473754882812] The only drawback was that the restaurant was a little on the pricey side for breakfast, but there are many places nearby to eat.
[0.024120330810546875] We did book directly on the Hilton chain website and got a rate of about $89.
[0.01486968994140625] On the downside, I just recently tried to make a reservation for another night with my husband, and they want to charge $10 for the second person.
[0.0037078857421875] It wasn't noisy at all as you might expect being so close to the runways.
[0.00262451171875] The hotel restaurant was nice enough, but again, bland; the food was nicely presented but had no taste.

[-0.48290252685546875] I think parking cost $12 or so.
[-0.4155921936035156] It looks nice on the outside,, but inside it is very shabby and used.
[-0.3897705078125] We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee.
[-0.3831634521484375] You are charged for parking - $8/night for outdoor parking.
[-0.375213623046875] At my prompting he suggested the self-park behind the hotel but it was almost as expensive as the valet!

[0.892542839050293] We had dinner in the attached restaurant, and the food was absolutely delicious.
[0.8081607818603516] The restaurant also had good food (we were given a $10 per person coupon to use in the restaurant from the hotel).
[0.4939918518066406] The restaurant was quite good considering it's not "downtown".
[0.47562313079833984] The restaurant and bar restaurant are better than average and again great staff.

[0.46030426025390625] Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax.
[0.005084991455078125] I didn't rent a car, so didn't have the worries of paying a parking fee at the hotel.
[0.0044097900390625] Self-parking is $19.
[0.00029754638671875] That's where I parked.
[-0.0010614395141601562] Unfortunately there was no wifi and the parking was $16 per night - expensive for the area.

[-0.20110702514648438] This place had a gigantic parking lot.
[-0.18401145935058594] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.

[0.9302864074707031] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.

[0.9487667083740234] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.

[-0.9498863220214844] Valet parking was very quick and hassle free.
[-0.9224777221679688] The parking situation was a bit weird - we had a rental we needed to return and we were given 20 free minutes to unload and get the car out, but the rental return was next door, whcih was nice.
[-0.8994321823120117] Free shuttle to and from airport helps.
[-0.8919296264648438] We purchased the Park and Fly Package and were very happy to discover that this package included valet parking for our car directly out front of the hotel, not off in a back parking lot or at an off site location like many other hotels.

[0.46429443359375] I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car.
[0.13690948486328125] I understand charging when leaving the car consecutive days when not using the hotel, but there shouldn't be a charge at a suburban hotel for guests for one night.
[0.09189605712890625] I can see paying parking for a downtown hotel - but for a hotel at Sea-Tac it seemed absurd to have to pay parking.
[0.08303070068359375] From the wings it was a bit of a hike to the restaurants and front desk.
