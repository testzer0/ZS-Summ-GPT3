[-0.4477272033691406] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[-0.36669921875] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[0.6725673675537109] We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.
