----- Supporting -----

[0.5595016479492188] There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.
[0.1050567626953125] While we didnâ€™t get the free breakfast others have mentioned, we ended up at a tiny place across the street called The Daily Brew.
[0.012037277221679688] All in all, I'd say this hotel is ok. Price needs to go down a bit and staff friendliness up some.
[0.0037088394165039062] We'll come back (although it is not cheap...).
[0.0022153854370117188] The breakfast on room service and in the hotel (buffet and menu) are both pretty pricey (around 18$ each approx).
