[0.8823661804199219] The building is older.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8823661804199219] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.
[0.0063266754150390625] The elevator was marked and scuffed.
[0.0055217742919921875] The lobby is warm and cozy with couches and a fireplace.
[0.00457000732421875] The furniture was comfortable.
[0.0031986236572265625] Other than the thin wall between rooms, it was an excellent stay and we'd definitely stay there again.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.968109130859375] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[-0.8488006591796875] the lobby is sort of lackluster but the rooms were tasfully updated and very clean.
[-0.3280029296875] We nearly thought our car was stolen!
[-0.14630126953125] Still not sure why our car could not be found for that time.

[0.4915771484375] The lobby has a nice little living room style waiting area but only takes 10 seconds to get through to the elevators.
[0.41070556640625] There is BTW always only one person at front desk, so you can find yourself lining up to get even the simplest things done, like getting a demagnetized card reprogrammed.
