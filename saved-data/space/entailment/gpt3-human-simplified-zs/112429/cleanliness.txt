[0.9204025268554688] The room was not clean when the reviewer arrived.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9204025268554688] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.
[0.484344482421875] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.233612060546875] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.
[0.20196533203125] I called down to the front desk to find out what time housekeeping would be coming by as I wanted to have a nap before I went to the game.
[0.1778564453125] It was rush hour, so the concierge had to stand out there quite a while to catch one that was empty.

[-0.2676239013671875] Lolita was great as well.
