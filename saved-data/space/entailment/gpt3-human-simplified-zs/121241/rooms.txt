[-0.9721870422363281] While the mom shops till she drops, the little girls and I always enjoy the huge indoor pool and hot tub no matter what the seasons brings outside.
[-0.9528579711914062] The room they serve it in is huge.

[0.9452724456787109] Rooms were nice in decor but there was dirt under the beds, TV was tiny, wireless internet was horrible, room was very small, pool and hot tub were tiny and full of rowdy kids with no one enforcing the rules of no jumping or horseplay, could not enjoy it at all.
