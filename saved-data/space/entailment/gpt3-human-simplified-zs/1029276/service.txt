[0.12881851196289062] Some guests felt that the staff lied about the bus system in Miami.

----- Supporting -----

[0.12881851196289062] Staff lied that the bus system of Miami was very difficult to use when in fact it was more inexpensive and a lot easier than getting around w/ a taxi.
[0.0250396728515625] For example, I was told by the front desk that I needed to go down to the transportation office in order to book the shuttle to the cruise terminal.
[0.02433013916015625] He told me that no one was at the transportation office but he took my room number and told me he would have a shuttle for me at the time requested.
[0.01851654052734375] If you're visiting the med school, it's supposedly only 2.5 miles away - but it took me nearly half an hour to deal with the miami traffic - so either familiarize yourself the night before OR leave early enough to address the bumper to bumper traffic.
[-0.0016880035400390625] Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing.
