[0.0105133056640625] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
[0.009090423583984375] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.0020399093627929688] But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking.
[0.001800537109375] Construction was happening on the exterior of the hotel.
