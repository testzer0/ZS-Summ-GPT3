[0.9882140159606934] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[0.0832672119140625] Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes.
[0.028885841369628906] Location wise hard to beat, just a short ferry ride from town and an easy walk over bridge.
[0.010430335998535156] Hop on a nearby ferry to explore downtown, the West End, Yaletown or Chinatown.
[0.00690460205078125] The wonderful public market and numerous restaurants and shops are just a quick walk away, as are the ferries that take you to other parts of Vancouver.

[-0.8639678955078125] We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel because it was close to the Stanley Theatre and a $12 cab fare to downtown.
[-0.8050136566162109] The place is a bit confusing to drive into at night if you're unfamiliar with the area, but my GPS showed the way.
[-0.7891120910644531] We had a car, so we were able to drive to many places in Vancouver like Stanley Park, Canada Place, Chinatown, Robson Street, Yaletown, etc.
[-0.7865791320800781] You can make a longer walk to Vanier Park and an even longer walk/easy drive to Kitsilano.
[-0.7452926635742188] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
