[-0.9956369400024414] The rooms are small and sparsely furnished.
[-0.9946355819702148] The room was the smallest we stayed in during our tour of western Canada, and it was a struggle to fit in a rollaway bed for my son.
[-0.9944572448730469] Room was quite small, with very limited closet space, especially for 2 adults and a child.
[-0.9944343566894531] The room was so tiny we could hardly fit in it.

[0.992332935333252] Big rooms with lots of windows.
[0.9711475372314453] A beautiful large modern style room with lots of windows.
[0.5974197387695312] The end room is great because even though it's small, 2 walls are window-sliders to balconies overlooking ritzy boats and water traffic.
[0.4325828552246094] I had a room with a view of False Creek, comfy beds, pleasant decor, windows that open.
[0.18993377685546875] My 8 year old could throw a rock into the water from our room but might hit one of the dozens of boats bobbing outside our window.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.5807647705078125] There are wrap-around balconies off every room with chairs and a table.
[-0.4125843048095703] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!
[-0.3375816345214844] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.290130615234375] There are plenty of paths to jog and walk around the water, and lots of choices for dinner and drinks.

[0.8550148010253906] The rooms were recently remodeled.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8550148010253906] All the rooms have been remodeled with nice big screen TVs, very comfortable beds and nice décor.
[0.841705322265625] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[0.7029342651367188] I couldn't stay at the seminar site as the hotel was booked solid from ongoing renovations.
[0.54595947265625] It is a mash up of 80s smoked glass and more recent upgrades and pseudo renovations.
[0.43329620361328125] Big clean remodelled bathroom.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9832973480224609] Even the bathrooms in the rooms where the bathrooms have not yet been remodeled are still very nice.
[-0.9360394477844238] The room was small and dark and old.
[-0.8903164863586426] The hotel was well appointed, our room comfortable and decorated in a traditional style.
[-0.8598146438598633] Its a bit old and some of the furnishings and fabrics in the room showed their age, but its clean and quiet and the mattress was comfortable.
[-0.8192253112792969] They need to update the place, but since it is the only hotel on Granville Island I think they are in no rush!

[0.31029510498046875] The rooms had balconies with views that were praised by the reviewers.

[0.31029510498046875] We also sat on the balcony of our room to watch the boats go by and enjoy the view.
[0.29267120361328125] The room itself was clean, the bathroom was very modern, and the views of the water/harbor were very pretty.
[0.2403564453125] We especially loved the modern shower with rainfall, massage, and regular options.
[0.23199462890625] I recommend room 326… vaulted ceiling with cedar beams, king bed, wet bar and a fantastic water view… at a standard room price.
[0.12295913696289062] It's in a perfect location, it's been recently updated, it's very clean, it has a lovely patio to enjoy the views from, it's located on Granville Island with it's many charming spots to shop, dine and enjoy the fabulous farmers market, it really couldn't be better.

[-0.9472150802612305] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.9054489135742188] My rating would have been 5 stars, except the room was quite small for two people 5 days, and the only view was over a roof and hvac unit.
[-0.7493553161621094] The only drawback could be room size as ours was only just adequate and the view was rather restricted.
[-0.7444648742675781] We were told none were available.
[-0.5942420959472656] Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc.
