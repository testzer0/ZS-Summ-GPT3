[0.9522180557250977] The building is new.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9522180557250977] The place is brand new so everything works just fine.
[0.009487152099609375] Definately recommend the property.
[0.001346588134765625] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[0.0002231597900390625] The lobby is also small.
[-0.000545501708984375] The lobby was packed with people waiting for their cars.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.5589218139648438] I was there the morning of the false fire alarm and although it was annoying I would rather it be false than for real!
[-0.3668212890625] How easy could it have been for someone else to leave with our truck if they could bring us the wrong car?
[-0.1330718994140625] We had to rent a car and travel back to US to have key made.
[-0.10359954833984375] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[-0.07132720947265625] The descriptions of the neighborhood other reviewers made in the past are correct: there are some questionable-looking people, but that is just one of the elements of any big city.
