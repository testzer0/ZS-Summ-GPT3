[0.5102615356445312] Then we asked the hotel (after we parked our car in the public parking) and they said that we'd pay $35 until 3 pm!!
[0.3814239501953125] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended

[0.8283271789550781] We really enjoyed our stay here, it is in good location in the Entertainment district, and though we didn't try the restauant or breakfast it looked very good!
[0.8223991394042969] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!

[-0.4333038330078125] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[-0.2616119384765625] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!
[-0.2225360870361328] Another thing is try to avoid the public parking across the hotel.
[-0.15142059326171875] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[-0.1508026123046875] If you have a car, consider the cost of parking.

[0.6538047790527344] Great location and a short walk to much of Toronto's sights.
[0.47446441650390625] Main attractions (CN Tower, Skydome) are less than 10 min walk, as they are all the theatre district amenities.
[0.28987693786621094] This hotel is a convenient walk to Rogers Centre, China Town, and some of the theaters.
[0.28443145751953125] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!

[-0.293670654296875] The accessible room was just that - very accessible.
[-0.24613189697265625] Another thing is try to avoid the public parking across the hotel.
[-0.2357769012451172] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[-0.19944000244140625] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!
[-0.16813278198242188] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
