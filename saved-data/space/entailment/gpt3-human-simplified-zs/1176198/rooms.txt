[-0.4745216369628906] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.
[-0.467926025390625] For some this may not be an issue, but also be aware, most rooms do not have bathtubs, just standup showers, so if you like to bath or have children who you need to bath, this is likely not the best choice.

[0.9473953247070312] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.
[0.9074478149414062] Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.

[0.9695377349853516] Pros: room very clean and well-lit; staff extremely helpful; extra comfortable beds (probably one of the best hotel beds I've slept in) Cons: room internet was very slow except for very basic email checks; breakfast room was understaffed so that two frantic staff-members were running around looking very flustered and struggling to deal with all the guests
[0.9473953247070312] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.
[0.9074478149414062] Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.
[0.8427944183349609] :-) Rooms VERY clean and were comfortable and roomy...sitting chairs and ottomans to put your feet up.
[0.78729248046875] The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the location was very convenient to a lot of major attractions downtown.
