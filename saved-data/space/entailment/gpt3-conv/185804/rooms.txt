[0.5378588438034058] It's a calm, well-designed "boutique" hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island.
[0.5378588438034058] Those small issues aside, this is a lovely hotel in a great area, close to the attractions of Vancouver yet far enough away to provide solace.

[0.5313035249710083] As I said the rooms are too small for all that furniture.
[0.5313035249710083] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!
[0.5313035249710083] We had a room with 2 double beds for my husband and myself and our two boys (12 and 6), and the space was comfortable (though not generous) for the 4 of us, even when returning to the room for some "down time".
[0.5313035249710083] The room was the smallest we stayed in during our tour of western Canada, and it was a struggle to fit in a rollaway bed for my son.

----- Supporting -----

[0.55254065990448] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
[0.5514822602272034] High end bathroom fixtures, comfortable bed with premium linens, free wifi.

[0.5304181575775146] The hotel itself is reasonably priced, has very open meeting rooms with doors directly outside.
[0.5313035249710083] The hotel is very modern, with the feel of a boutique 5 star hotel.
[0.5313035249710083] Same quality as a Sandman hotel but paid $250 per night for the room.

[0.5466238856315613] The standard room was very good, on the ground floor overlooking the patio area, and we would have happily stayed there if the king suite had been unavailable.

[0.5313035249710083] The balcony had impressive views and was private, the suite was huge and very comfortable.
[0.5313035249710083] I wish that there were a way to turn off the outside lights, however, so that I could leave the curtains open at night to catch the lights from the buildings across False Creek.

[0.5502564311027527] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.

[0.5476415753364563] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[0.5470289587974548] But if you spend very little time in the hotel, as we generally do, then it is just OK and sometimes even better than just OK when you look at the lights of downtown at night over the water.
[0.5466598272323608] The marble tile floors in the rooms make for easy management of the pet-friendly policy, so I don't mark this hotel down for that as some other reviewers have mentioned.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5366135835647583] It was OK for this purpose.

[0.5466598272323608] At the end of a tiring day, the hotel hot tub is the ideal place to unwind and ease those aching limbs.
[0.5466598272323608] But if you spend very little time in the hotel, as we generally do, then it is just OK and sometimes even better than just OK when you look at the lights of downtown at night over the water.
