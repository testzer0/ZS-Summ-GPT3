**********

[0.5378588438034058] The only downside is that they can be quite small.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5477402210235596] They had free bottle of wine and chocolates in our room for our anniversary which was nice but I had to ask 3 times for ice bucket (it is small hotel so there are no ice machines on the floors).
[0.5472411513328552] We complained and they just moved us to an even smaller room with the same view.
[0.5472297668457031] The pool is also small, but it does have a great view of downtown.
[0.5461465716362] The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars (if I could it would be 4.75) on "Service" is b/c they weren't so timely on pre-arranged room service...we asked for it by a certain time and it arrived about a half hour later.
[0.5452446341514587] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5313035249710083] The bath and toilet were divided into two separate rooms, and the sink area was separate.
[0.5313035249710083] They finally were ok with the outside food once they realized we were NOT moving it and were still quite unhappy about the pool situation.
[0.5313035249710083] The Joule is not luxurious in comparison and not sure why Starwood has it branded as such.
[0.5313035249710083] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".
[0.5313035249710083] I wasn't crazy about the way the bathroom is a bit open to the room.

[0.5313035249710083] The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars (if I could it would be 4.75) on "Service" is b/c they weren't so timely on pre-arranged room service...we asked for it by a certain time and it arrived about a half hour later.

[0.5313035249710083] (Not Four Seasons, Not Zaza, Not The Crescent) Get my point?
[0.5313035249710083] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).

[0.5313035249710083] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[0.5313035249710083] They finally were ok with the outside food once they realized we were NOT moving it and were still quite unhappy about the pool situation.
[0.5313035249710083] I wasn't crazy about the way the bathroom is a bit open to the room.
[0.5313035249710083] We stayed in one of the lofts and initially had some temperature issues but they were addressed quickly.

[0.55369633436203] The warm, modern feel of the hotel is a big hit with our guests!
[0.5488782525062561] It was incredibly trendy and modern without being intimidating and cold.
[0.5466598272323608] The Joule is a sexy, elegant, fun, cool and incredibly unique experience.
[0.5466598272323608] I loved the bathroom set up and the shower was huge, big enough for 4 couples (if you're into that sort of thing).
[0.5466598272323608] From the lobby to the rooms, this hotel has been very tastefully decorated â€¢ Rooms â€“ Very chic rooms.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5313035249710083] The Joule has a modern feel kind of like the W but it is warmer feeling and more comforatble than the W. The pool at the Joule is amazing and is actually where they film the outdoor bar scenes for ABC's The Deep End which is the show is set in LA but is actually filmed in Dallas.
[0.5313035249710083] It is unlike any Starwood I have stayed at and we were delighted to have a boutique experience with the perks of a Starwood hotel.
[0.5313035249710083] Great hotel interiors, dark moody decor in rooms.
[0.5313035249710083] The pool with the inifinty edge over Main St was an added attraction, great place to hang out and people watch!
[0.5313035249710083] Other than that no complaints, beautiful pool on the 10th floor and up to date fitness center with bottles of water and fruit.

[0.5509709715843201] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".
[0.5488782525062561] Our tweens loved the salt water heated infinity pool, the Charlie Palmer bar, awesome room service and gorgeous room......we live in Carrollton, but felt we had traveled to another luxurious country!
[0.5475272536277771] The rooms are astonishing, my favorite detail in the entire room was the lights that are built into the headboard.
[0.5475272536277771] They had free bottle of wine and chocolates in our room for our anniversary which was nice but I had to ask 3 times for ice bucket (it is small hotel so there are no ice machines on the floors).
[0.5466598272323608] See this being perfect for business (nice desk, free internet) or a romantic getaway.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5311765670776367] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[0.5313035249710083] The Joule is not luxurious in comparison and not sure why Starwood has it branded as such.
[0.5313035249710083] 2 - We stayed in the Demi-Joule room and it was very small.
[0.5313035249710083] We had dinner at Nobu which is in Crescent Court which was really good too.
[0.5313035249710083] The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars (if I could it would be 4.75) on "Service" is b/c they weren't so timely on pre-arranged room service...we asked for it by a certain time and it arrived about a half hour later.
