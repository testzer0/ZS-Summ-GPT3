[0.5378588438034058] The service at the hotel was terrible, and it seemed as if they had the "summer staff" on duty.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5454317331314087] My patience was def tested at this hotel at the incompetence incurred.
[0.5454317331314087] We were barked at by the manager twice for bringing in outside food eve though we were buying their pricey drinks and paying for rooms there.
[0.5426965951919556] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[0.5413144826889038] Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an "upscale" hotel.
[0.5413144826889038] Absolutely ridiculous service for any hotel let alone one u pay $300+ a night for.

[0.5327207446098328] I suggest you take a look at the managment position as the pool ran out of Chardoney on Saturday night before 10pm and no one offered to go get us some more.
[0.5329059958457947] It was insulting that the doorman/management were so disrespectful and unwilling to take care of their guest.
[0.5378588438034058] I stayed here for one night for a short business trip with meetings in Dallas downtown.
