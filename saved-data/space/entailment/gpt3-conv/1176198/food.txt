[0.5510221123695374] There was even a decent wine selction and a waiter that offered reliable advice.
[0.5508707761764526] For a price of $10 we had a choice of hot and cold items, both ready made, and made to order.
[0.5488782525062561] Fresh fruit and fruit juices, breads and pastries, and coffee brought to the table rather than stewed out of a communal urn.
[0.5470880270004272] The dining option was reasonable and the food (dinner & breakfast) was ok. Actually, dinner was of better quality than I was expecting since this wasn't a full service Hilton.
[0.5466598272323608] There's good coffee nearby (I'm fairly sure that they didn't offer breakfast).
