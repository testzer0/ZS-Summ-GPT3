[0.5313035249710083] Cannot complain about hotel.
[0.5316861271858215] (1) Location of the hotel is ideal , my wife was thrilled as it was within short walling distance to the Eaton center one of the largest shopping centers in Toronto (2) Room is spacious compared to other 4 star hotels, good furniture, clean and neat (3) Good entertainment with LCD 37 inch TV with on demand movies and more (4) Staff are friendly and professional, good staffing numbers very adequate (5) Breakfast was great and included in the price of around US$ 200 per night , very fair price for this hotel, the breakfast included fresh fruits (Produce of Canada) and eggs and an egg station and many other delights

[0.5314888954162598] Overrall, my room was a comfortable place to spend some time (I liked the large flat panel tv), while the rest of the hotel was unexciting.
[0.5378588438034058] I thought that was OK, so I accepted the room and settled in.

[0.5461652278900146] It is connected by a walkway to the Eaton Centre and when you park at the hotel (valet is the way for only $25) you can get just about anywhere on foot, bus, or subway.

[0.532686173915863] There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.
