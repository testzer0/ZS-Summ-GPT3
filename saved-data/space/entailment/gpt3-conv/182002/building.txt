[0.5454317331314087] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[0.5426965951919556] We also experienced the subway and found it was very easy to get around.
[0.5426965951919556] It wasn't obvious and I only noticed it because I was accessing a wall plug behind the bedside table.
[0.5426965951919556] Be prepared to wait at least five minutes, and the doors sensors do not work, which was very annoying.

[0.5316861271858215] We were beside the elevator and at one point someone in the elevator kept hitting the alarm button and we could hear it.
[0.5378588438034058] We were lost in a city we HAD never been in for 10 mintues during the night.
[0.5378588438034058] You might also get stuck in the elevator, though the manager said that it happens all the time.
[0.5378588438034058] And if you're lucky the alarm button in the elevator will have been fixed by then.
