----- Supporting -----

[0.5488782525062561] Located on a loud busy road frequantly used by the local fire departmentand large lorries, Constant pestering from the ticket stand to sell you a timeshare and tickets.
[0.5418393015861511] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.5413144826889038] I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.
[0.540330708026886] Not much, but you have to bring a quarter to fill your ice-bucket, annoying if you don't know this and have to walk back to your room to find change.

[0.5523480176925659] The location is a little out the way for Universal, Prime Outlets (formerly Beltz), I Drive etc but it's only 5 minutes from Disney, you can see the top of Expedition Everest from the car park at the back!!
[0.5499274730682373] There are plenty of other shops & restaurants around the hotel.
[0.5484338998794556] The parking lot was clean, the location of the hotel was GREAT (right next to many restaraunts, souvenier shops, and within 5 minutes to the Disnet World Parks).
[0.5484338998794556] The location is superb - close to restaurants, supermarkets and Disney.
[0.5483137369155884] However the best bit of this hotel is by far the location, just 2 mile from Disney and surrounded by quality restaurants and shops, you can not go wrong.

[0.5313035249710083] We booked through First Choice and they really should not be selling this place to customers.
[0.5313035249710083] The one thing I was a bit 'meh' about; you have to pay for ice.
[0.5326208472251892] The hotel is actually in a good position on the 192 highway, really near to disney & close to lots of good places to eat - red lobster was the best it was just across the road.

[0.5487927198410034] On arrival the hotel was really easy to find, marker 4 on highway 192, our sat nav brought up Quality inn westgate which is the hotels old name.
[0.5468611121177673] the hotel is on the main strip but once you close your door you dont hear any noise from traffic etc .
[0.546170175075531] It is located on 192 which is close to everything which is nice but I would say to stay somewhere else, somewhere with basic amenities for the same budget price.
[0.5454317331314087] Superb location for Disney with a back road out of the hotel that cuts out all the queues on the 192.

[0.5313035249710083] Location was good - on the 192, 5mins from Interstate 4 - 40mins sea world and universal, 1hr to Busch Gardens, 1hr 15 to Kennedy Space Center.
[0.5314888954162598] The location is excellent - this end of the 192 is like a miniature (but busier) version of International Drive!!
[0.5358073711395264] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
