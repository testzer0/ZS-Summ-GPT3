[0.5378588438034058] Some guests found the continental breakfast to be a joke, with only cereal, toast, and waffles available, and long lines.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5413144826889038] Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative.
[0.5378588438034058] It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!
[0.5378588438034058] You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.
[0.5378588438034058] The less said about the pool though the better.
[0.5378588438034058] This hotel provides you with what you would expect for the price, and the cleanliness of our room gave us no real concerns.

[0.5313035249710083] I was disappointed that there was no breakfast, eventhough it was just toast & cereal it was a bonus, but there are many places to eat nearby.
[0.5313035249710083] We had the breakfast 1 day which was okay - but got really busy, we prefered to go out for breakfast to the Ponderosa which is just up the road.
[0.5313035249710083] Complimentary breakfast was mediocre, I'd rather go to some nearby restaurant's breakfast buffets for $4++/person.
[0.5313035249710083] I thought the included breakfast is indicative of poor American eating habits - just a bundh of donuts and not a piece of fruit in sight.
[0.5313035249710083] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.

[0.5426965951919556] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.
[0.5426965951919556] But overall, you are not paying for the Ritz.

[0.5253061056137085] The room wasn't really that bad we were on the smoking floor (3rd floor) it was just very basic with a very small bathroom, there were always little ants around the sink area but no matter how many you washed away double the amount would come back.

[0.5313035249710083] This hotel has a serious bed bug problem and they are not willing to take care of the issue.
[0.5316861271858215] The breakfast is plain cereal, toast coffee and juice but we wouldn't want more than that anyway.

[0.5426965951919556] I am an early riser(6.30 to 7am) and so I had the breakfast area to myself but did get much busy later on.I found all staff to be very helpfull There are a few restaurants and fast food places within walking distance and a Walgreens not far away There is a shuttle bus to Epcot (you need to use Disney Transport to get to other parks) it leaves at 8.45am and about 1pm.

[0.5426965951919556] The continental breakfast was a bit of a scrum.
[0.5426965951919556] So, on balance, yes, it's cheap if you're on a big budget but, when you balance it all up, unless you're ok with roughing it a bit, you might want to consider paying a few mpore dollars and going for something a little more up-market.
[0.5426965951919556] The Hotel dont provide continental breakfast any more !
[0.5426965951919556] I would highly suggest spending more money to stay at a Disney property or a more expensive hotel.

[0.5302414298057556] THE GOOD....Fast Check-in,Close to Disney, Free pool towels, Clean, safe pool, Easy walking distance to restraunts, Free basic breakfast THE BAD....Air-con was loud and slow, paper thin walls, not enough cupboard space, poor decor, small bathroom, no porter, Unreliable and not enough park transfers, Bad smells in room.
[0.5312874913215637] Let's just say...when you stay in a hotel, the minute you walk in to your room you shouldn't feel like you need to check the sheets and look under the mattresses first before you bring your luggage in - but for this place I definitely did.
[0.5313035249710083] First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.

[0.5378588438034058] We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.

[0.5378588438034058] This was our 5th visit to Orlando and our first budget trip and i have to say that this little gem of a hotel is far superior to other more expensive ones in the area.
[0.5378588438034058] Our room had a brand new air conditioning unit which was quiter than the ones we are used to, a microwave, fridge, freezer, hairdryer, safe and TV.
[0.5378588438034058] The pool was a good size, very clean and looked out onto the lake.
[0.5378588438034058] I would highly recommend a trip to the Rainforest Cafe in Downtown Disney, Hardrock Cafe in Universal, Bennigans on I drive and Johnny Rockets at the Pointe they are all brilliant!!
[0.5378588438034058] Without a doubt I'd return to this hotel, it's superb value for money.

[0.5313035249710083] I never made it to breakfast on time so can't comment on that.

[0.5313035249710083] The next morning we got up early and went to get breakfast.. it was set up in the LOBBY!
[0.5313035249710083] I wouldnt even call it a breakfast buffet.. there was toast or some skanky cereal or make your own waffle.. which tasted vile.
[0.5313035249710083] Our tub had a cover over it and I was afraid to lift it up to see what was under it.

[0.5378588438034058] The breakfast is very poor, with few options and not enough seating.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5502564311027527] breakfast is all you can eat or drink until 9.30am and then be gone because its cleared away pronto.
[0.5488782525062561] I thought the included breakfast is indicative of poor American eating habits - just a bundh of donuts and not a piece of fruit in sight.
[0.5488782525062561] I wouldnt even call it a breakfast buffet.. there was toast or some skanky cereal or make your own waffle.. which tasted vile.
[0.5467377305030823] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[0.5454317331314087] The continental breakfast was a bit of a scrum.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5253061056137085] Small dining area and ice machines as well as a small shop on the premises.
[0.5300560593605042] Very basic, the bathroom was tiny and dirty.. i didnt even want to step in the shower it was that bad, it smelt and was just yuck!
[0.5313035249710083] Our ice machine was broken...beyond all that, though, we got a non-smoking room 2 miles from the Disney Main Gate for about $30 a night.
[0.5313035249710083] I would not recommend this hotel really - it is very basic, so is the breakfast
[0.5313035249710083] The Hotel used to provide a continental breakfast but this was stopped on the 1st of January 2012, so now you can only get coffee in the gift shop.
