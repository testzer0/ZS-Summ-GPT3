[0.5378588438034058] Ate at on-site bar/restaurant which was good.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5313035249710083] Strange for such a large hotel not to have a restaurant or two.

[0.5488782525062561] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!
[0.5449661612510681] :) The only complaint is - parking for overnight cost $16, and on top of that, we had $1.40 of tax!!!

----- Weakening -----

[0.5313035249710083] You are charged for parking - $8/night for outdoor parking.
[0.5313035249710083] The parking situation was a bit weird - we had a rental we needed to return and we were given 20 free minutes to unload and get the car out, but the rental return was next door, whcih was nice.
[0.5327438116073608] Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax.
[0.5327865481376648] ;) BAD: --YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PARK HERE.

[0.5300142168998718] The only issue we had was the size of the hotel with various wings that were difficult to navigate.
[0.5313035249710083] I had to trek all the way to the front-desk from out tower location (to have key re-coded) only to f ind it did not resolve issue.
[0.5313035249710083] Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water.
[0.5319870710372925] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
[0.5378588438034058] It had easy access to the light rail located at the airport (we took the DT shuttle over), and was next to an Enterprise car rental.

[0.5475785136222839] We purchased the Park and Fly Package and were very happy to discover that this package included valet parking for our car directly out front of the hotel, not off in a back parking lot or at an off site location like many other hotels.
[0.5466598272323608] Our room was reserved well in advance, with no mention of a parking fee for their guests!

[0.5366135835647583] It was for a wing room but the reservation staff courteously changed it to a tower room.
[0.5366135835647583] The view we had was of some large trees and some people's backyards- better than the parking lot for us (but I wouldn't want to live there!).
[0.537842869758606] Also nice view of some trees out the balcony.
[0.5378588438034058] Very conveinient for early morning flights.

[0.5313035249710083] The hotel restaurant was nice enough, but again, bland; the food was nicely presented but had no taste.
[0.5314888954162598] The only drawback was that the restaurant was a little on the pricey side for breakfast, but there are many places nearby to eat.
