[0.5311667919158936] Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
[0.5314888954162598] There was one occasion in which we ordered from the menu, sadly it was a little disappointing because it was overcooked but we were taken care of almost immediately when we complained.

[0.5426965951919556] Too many hobos and drug addicts!!!
[0.5378588438034058] The manager called and said the water was safe and we explained we did not feel comfortable bathing and brushing our teeth in green water.
[0.5378588438034058] Had a great internet deal we found on hilton.com for the website, so we were able to stay there for under $65 a night.
[0.5378588438034058] Also a salad place and sandwich shop just past 19th St (hotel is on 16th).
[0.5378588438034058] Again conference food just ok though, damn those $16 DOJ muffins Rooms a are good, big tvs, comfy beds, nice setup.

[0.5378588438034058] Since we paid $210 for the night I thought we'd get free parking - we used the valet service for $28 (plus tips) which we found pricey also.
[0.5378588438034058] We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.
