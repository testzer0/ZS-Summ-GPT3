[0.9354610443115234] The building is decorated.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9354610443115234] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.4938507080078125] *The art in the rooms are old and are of Delta, why not GI?
[0.02278900146484375] You do have a art institute across the road.
[0.02178955078125] Nothing a little renovation couldn't quickly take care of.

[-0.3280029296875] While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
[-0.204132080078125] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
[-0.11962890625] There is no easy chair.
[-0.1196136474609375] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.1183013916015625] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
