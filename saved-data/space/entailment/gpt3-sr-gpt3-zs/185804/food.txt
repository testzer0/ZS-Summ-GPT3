[0.00140380859375] * Way over priced and not the price I had booked online Overall this is a good choice for the location and if it is within your budget, just don't expect too much.
[0.0013141632080078125] The two water taxis companies serving Granville Island make it very accessible to downtown as well.
[0.000812530517578125] you could easily spend most of your time there since there are lots of restaurants and a fantastic public market featuring lots of food.
[-0.000225067138671875] It's a really cool market.

[-0.8286962509155273] In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.

[-0.2859001159667969] I disagree: the beers are lightweight.
[-0.2280254364013672] Really rocking and that's not a bad thing eh :) But chasing down something to eat this late on the island was hopeless.
[-0.198822021484375] The food market made me wish I was cooking and not eating out at restaurants!
