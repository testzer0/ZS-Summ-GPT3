----- Supporting -----

[0.9492568969726562] The rooms were large and nicely appointed.
[0.8909759521484375] The rooms seem to have been recently updated and are well kept.
[0.8181781768798828] We had connecting rooms, these were prepared to a very high standard, house keeping do a first class job in this hotel.
[0.7926826477050781] The room itself was up to Marriott's usual standards - well done, not over-the-top luxurious, but very nice.
[0.7617912292480469] The rooms are clean and the beds are extremely comfortable...it was actually hard to get up in the morning!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9910602569580078] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.

[-0.9516639709472656] However, the rooms are very average (no safe, mini-bar for example).
[-0.9504776000976562] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
