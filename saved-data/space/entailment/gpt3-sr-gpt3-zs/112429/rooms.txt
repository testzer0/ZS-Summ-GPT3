[-0.7614212036132812] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.6689462661743164] Ok, it is bad.
[-0.5780706405639648] The biggest issue is that upon going to bed the first night, I noticed an overpowering smell of urine in my bed.
[-0.40491199493408203] We booked the Paramount with a little apprehension, since downtown hotels are often either industrial/impersonal or old school fusty.
[-0.37265968322753906] I'm normally a firm matress kind of guy, but I swear lying on that bed was like lying on a cloud.
