[-0.9977598190307617] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.9801506996154785] This is a small place and they react quickly.
[-0.9724774360656738] Cons 1- No view really.
[-0.9120941162109375] Things I don't love about the Paramount: The view isn't much --- the rooms look toward other high-rise buildings.
[-0.8789958953857422] Don't take a room on the inside unless you want to be awakened by the garbage trucks at 5am.

[0.9716486930847168] It is close to everything and it was convenient to walk everywhere.
[0.7559194564819336] Right downtown could walk everywhere, didn't need a car.
[0.7407417297363281] The location was pretty good, we could walk to almost all the downtown sites we wanted to see.
[0.6867351531982422] Location-wise, this hotel is just a short walk to all of the attractions, and the monorail, which will get you over to the Space Needle and Experience Music Project area.
[0.6671104431152344] Location was amazing with 2 movie theatres (our bellman went down and printed off the movie listings from their computer and brought them back to our room) and markets easily walkable.

[-0.8937587738037109] Valet parking was terrible.
[-0.839813232421875] But really the hotel is a $7 cab ride to anything that you want to see that isn't near by.
[-0.7904624938964844] Be warned - you can walk to Pike Place Market from here, but the trip back to the hotel has a vicious hill - wear good shoes or be prepared to take a cab.

[-0.512481689453125] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.

[-0.3426513671875] Valet parking was terrible.

[0.9531021118164062] The hotel has a charge for parking.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9531021118164062] It was easy to find street parking (so we didn't need to pay the hotel parking rate).
[0.80560302734375] I got a good deal by booking on the hotel's website where parking was only one dollar extra.
[0.6448211669921875] The location is great (ten minute walk from Pike Place Market) but construction in and around the area means you're forced to use valet parking ($25/night).
[0.63836669921875] When we talked to the front desk, they told us they contract out their parking (United Parking) and referred us to the supervisor of the company.
[0.5044021606445312] The parking is $27 a night, info they seem to forget to tell you about.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.83123779296875] Dragonfish restaurant attached is not run by the hotel but lets you sign charges to your room, and is a very good place, if a bit pricey.
[-0.7862167358398438] Also, the restaurant downstairs I assummed is affiliated with the hotel, but the bill gave you no option to bill it to your room.
[-0.5523204803466797] Everything is at your doorstep.
[-0.40967559814453125] Small portions to share, beyond cheap happy hour prices (we didn't pay over $5 for anything we ordered.)
[-0.38105010986328125] No parking at the hotel but there is a public parking garage across the street at the Hyatt.
