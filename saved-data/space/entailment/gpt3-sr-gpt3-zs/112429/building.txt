[0.8823661804199219] The building is older.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8823661804199219] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.
[0.0063266754150390625] The elevator was marked and scuffed.
[0.0055217742919921875] The lobby is warm and cozy with couches and a fireplace.
[0.00457000732421875] The furniture was comfortable.
[0.0031986236572265625] Other than the thin wall between rooms, it was an excellent stay and we'd definitely stay there again.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.968109130859375] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[-0.8488006591796875] the lobby is sort of lackluster but the rooms were tasfully updated and very clean.
[-0.3280029296875] We nearly thought our car was stolen!
[-0.14630126953125] Still not sure why our car could not be found for that time.

[-0.084625244140625] There is BTW always only one person at front desk, so you can find yourself lining up to get even the simplest things done, like getting a demagnetized card reprogrammed.

[-0.02713775634765625] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.

[0.9722518920898438] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.
[0.938206672668457] Tons of construction in the neighborhood which starts at 6:30 am.

[0.14947509765625] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
