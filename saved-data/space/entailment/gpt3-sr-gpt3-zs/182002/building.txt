[-0.9058761596679688] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[-0.9012298583984375] Tim Hortons right in the lobby which was very convenient.
[-0.790435791015625] We also experienced the subway and found it was very easy to get around.

[0.9582557678222656] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!
[0.026449203491210938] It was quickley rectified and someone brought me a new iron within minuets.
[0.018308162689208984] Nice lobby.

[-0.751434326171875] Our car was broken into.
[-0.20697784423828125] We were beside the elevator and at one point someone in the elevator kept hitting the alarm button and we could hear it.
