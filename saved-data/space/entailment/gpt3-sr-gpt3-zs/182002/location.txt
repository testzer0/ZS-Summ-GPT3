[0.6023807525634766] First impression, it was in a decent area, not too far from the central part of downtown with all the restaurants and I thought ok, not too bad.
[0.50897216796875] Our room was good, the bed very good - but it was disappointing to find that the "new and exciting Primrose Restaurant and Bar where no expense had been spared" (according to their brochure) was CLOSED except for breakfast time.

----- Supporting -----

[0.837249755859375] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.4507026672363281] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.04381561279296875] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.007982254028320312] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
[0.0062389373779296875] The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot!

[-0.959442138671875] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.
[-0.5298423767089844] Heed this warning stay away from this crappy place, you'll be glad you did.
[-0.4531364440917969] The underground parking is horribly laid out.
[-0.19140625] The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out.
[-0.1390056610107422] I would not reccomend this place to even my worst ennemies.

[-0.9260406494140625] the one across the street from the "Made in China" chinese restaurant, which was decent cheap eats on it's own!
[-0.91156005859375] Across the street from the old Maple Leaf Gardens, and it looks like a new grocery store is about to open up there soon.

----- Supporting -----

[0.04378509521484375] The hotel was in a good location and it was easy to get a cab just outside the hotel to the clubs.
[0.00811004638671875] The parking garage was a little tight to drive around in, but other than that, I would definately go back for another weekend with the guys.
[0.0067138671875] The location was perfect as I walked to the Eaton Centre which was about 10 minutes away, and then the cab ride back only cost $8 including a tip.
[0.006504058837890625] The hotel itself is in a good location.
[0.0059814453125] All in all, a great place to go for some fun times in Toronto!

[0.9906301498413086] The cost of parking is $23 a day.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9906301498413086] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.24192047119140625] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.1546630859375] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[-0.0032892227172851562] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[-0.003972053527832031] Great location, close to CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Yonge Street, Hockey Hall of Fame.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.86505126953125] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[-0.74774169921875] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
[-0.7062358856201172] They were also kind enough to recommend and make reservations at a lovely restaurant called Ruth Chris (pricey but well worth it if you are a steak lover).
[-0.43285369873046875] This is not to complain about Tim Hortons in any way, but were were dissapointed of the "limited" menu they have had there.
[-0.4233818054199219] The best thing about the room was its view.
