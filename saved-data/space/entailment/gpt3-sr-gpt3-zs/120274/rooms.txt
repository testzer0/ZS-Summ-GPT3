[-0.9088659286499023] This hotel has a serious bed bug problem and they are not willing to take care of the issue.
[-0.8724069595336914] Our toilet never flushed properly and the washrooms were dirty.
[-0.86676025390625] I was disappointed that there was no breakfast, eventhough it was just toast & cereal it was a bonus, but there are many places to eat nearby.
[-0.857940673828125] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[-0.8352108001708984] We left the next day after a nightmare night and overcrowded non eatable breakfast that you had to stay in line for half an hour.

[0.9540872573852539] I had a fantastic room with a kitchenette paying only £15/night (booked through an English travel agent).
[0.9419431686401367] When we got to our room, we were suprised to see they upgraded us to a room with a kitchenette.
[0.9357900619506836] When we first arrived, our first impression was, great and when we got into the room it was even better as we had a fridge, microwave & Tea & Coffee facilities (We did how ever pay extra for this pleasure of about £1 a day.)

[0.9624824523925781] But we didn't have any kitchen equipment in our room like some others have mentioned.
[0.9599170684814453] The motels website states that fridges are in the room, but there was not one to be seen.
[0.9483428001403809] There is no fridge in the room, there is no coffee in the room, the safe in the room doesn't work.
[0.9325275421142578] The fridge and microwave are not available in 'standard' rooms.
[0.9106540679931641] All in all i would stay there again but would request having a fridge as all of the rooms do not have them and the ice machine played up alot.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.20333099365234375] Also, the hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast.
[-0.19439697265625] Theres lots of restaurants very close.. a steak house, TGI fridays, outback, subway etc etc.. and a supermarket aswell which was handy.
[-0.173583984375] Three types of cereal, toast and waffles to eat, milk, coffee and juice.
[-0.1566162109375] My only complaint would be the continental breakfast.
[-0.14239501953125] So, on balance, yes, it's cheap if you're on a big budget but, when you balance it all up, unless you're ok with roughing it a bit, you might want to consider paying a few mpore dollars and going for something a little more up-market.

[0.8757514953613281] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[0.717803955078125] We never went for the free breakfast as there was never a table free but there's a Ponderosa just down the road.
[0.6897811889648438] Breakfast is a free for all,only one toaster for all the guests, we had to take ours back to our room as never any where to sit.
[0.6215362548828125] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.

[0.7003250122070312] We had breakfast every morning and although basic it was ok. We booked our Universal Studio tickets here and got a very good deal.
[0.6612586975097656] The breakfast was only coffee, OJ, cereal and toast, however this was adequate for us and our children.
[0.649383544921875] We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.
