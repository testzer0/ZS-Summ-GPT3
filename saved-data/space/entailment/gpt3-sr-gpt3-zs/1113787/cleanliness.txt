[-0.5013046264648438] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.2940025329589844] I know this could happen anywhere but in years of valet parking it hasnt so this was quite annoying.
[-0.2916107177734375] Loved the rose prosecco too :-) the decor was really fun and innovative throughout, like the large moving cogs by the check-in desk or the chairs in the lobby with sliding silver tables attached, or the secret reading lamp on the guestrooms headboards.
[-0.22057723999023438] I had two problems with this place, first when I arrived home the day of our last stay I reviewed the invoice which had been emailed to me and was charged $202.00 for a dinner at Charlie Palmers, but we never dined at Charlie Palmers.
