[0.064483642578125] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.

[-0.31584930419921875] our names, what we liked, everyone congratulated us on our anniversary!
[-0.2557220458984375] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[-0.19427871704101562] Trip to this hotel started off VERY poorly with a bungled reservation.

[0.1949329376220703] The location was praised for its pool.

[0.1949329376220703] The pool is amazing and the restaurant cuisine is outstanding.
[0.035125732421875] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.001033782958984375] Their nightclub, PM, manages the pool area.
[0.0005245208740234375] We were on the 10th floor which is where the Pool/Bar is located.
[0.000316619873046875] I definitely will try to get back when it is warmer!

[-0.76739501953125] The convenient location of The Joule allowed us to choose from a variety of restaurants.
[-0.4170265197753906] There is a Neiman Marcus and a decent Mexican restaurant next door, but there's also a boarded up building.
[-0.3197021484375] Also, it was very nice to be next door to Neiman Marcus.
[-0.3107452392578125] Wish the weather had been nice enough to use the pool.
[-0.309356689453125] So, one word of caution; empty your car entirely when parking in their valet lot.

[0.5886116027832031] The weather was not conducive to using the pool during the reviewers' stay.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5886116027832031] We wish the weather had been warmer so we could have tried out the pool.
[0.2154064178466797] Wish the weather had been nice enough to use the pool.
[0.0695953369140625] The only downside was that I was there in January, and the Poule was not open.
[0.017578125] The guest who remained were forced to go across the street to a dive bar where the b-day girl began to cry uncontrollably over her ruined special evening.
[-0.00142669677734375] Had we been paying attention though, we could have asked for a room on the back side of the hotel when we made our reservation.

[-0.7226066589355469] The pool is amazing and the restaurant cuisine is outstanding.
[-0.7058696746826172] I loved Charlie Palmer's.
[-0.5703582763671875] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.
[-0.3122444152832031] I took a photo of it with my camera.
