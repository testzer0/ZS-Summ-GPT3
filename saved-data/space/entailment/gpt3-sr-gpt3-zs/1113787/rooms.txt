[-0.7957906723022461] Maybe I just had a bad experience but I was throughly disappointed in this hotel.

[-0.315704345703125] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
