[0.9291915893554688] The hotel has Valet parking only which is fine since you can walk to everything.
[0.9123992919921875] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.

[0.43743896484375] The man there told us that at the hotel we can park the car for $35 and had to take it out before 1 pm whereas we can park it for $40 in his parking until 3 pm.
[0.392822265625] Then we asked the hotel (after we parked our car in the public parking) and they said that we'd pay $35 until 3 pm!!
[0.27056884765625] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended
[0.2526092529296875] Paid $35.00 to park overnight across the street.

[0.6970367431640625] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.16732025146484375] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.0464019775390625] Three of us stayed for two nights on a hectic trip, arriving on an overnight flight from the States.

[-0.105224609375] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
[-0.055328369140625] The hotel is close enough to the big attractions to be convenient but still is not in an overly busy/loud part of town which was nice.
[-0.0468902587890625] We had no trouble getting there - handy to Lakeshore Blvd.
[-0.04117393493652344] The rooms are equal to anything Hilton offers, the fitness facility is first rate and the restaurant staff are friendly and attentive - to the right degree.
[-0.04077911376953125] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!

[0.9332027435302734] It is in a great location and in walking distance to all the entertainment in downtown Toronto!
[0.9240303039550781] Close to everything downtown and the shops and restaurants of Queen St. & King St. W.... within easy walk distance of the theater district as well.
[0.8945159912109375] The location was wonderful, a stones throw from King Street which is the entertainment district area.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8516082763671875] Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.

[0.44891357421875] Parking is convenient.

----- Supporting -----

[0.44891357421875] The hotel has Valet parking only which is fine since you can walk to everything.
[0.37834930419921875] I think the valet parking at the hotel is around the same amount and you can take your car in and out as needed.
[0.26836395263671875] There are lots of parking lots near by that look cheaper than the hotel valet system (one right across the road).
[0.18701171875] We parked our car and never looked back because everything was within walking distance.
[0.12237548828125] The man there told us that at the hotel we can park the car for $35 and had to take it out before 1 pm whereas we can park it for $40 in his parking until 3 pm.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9899578094482422] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
[-0.9455089569091797] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[-0.9254150390625] Parking rates are high as you will find in all major cities around the world.
[-0.9216156005859375] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[-0.90289306640625] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.

[0.9851112365722656] Parking is valet-only.

[0.9851112365722656] Parking is valet only (would prefer the option to self park).
[0.9795427322387695] The hotel has Valet parking only which is fine since you can walk to everything.
[0.9113616943359375] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.
[0.7191925048828125] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.
[0.71881103515625] Some caveats: The valet parking [only option] is $35 CAD.

[-0.9287033081054688] Took about 5 minutes to walk.
