[0.9138526916503906] Second, my husband and I are both businesspeople, and to get wireless internet in our room, we were EACH charged $9.99 a day, even though their materials all say "wireless internet in your room for only $9.99 a day."
[0.53985595703125] Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all.
[0.205657958984375] Wireless internet access is $9.95 which isn't bad by most comparisons.

[-0.3184356689453125] Another positive was the free internet service in the lobby (they had 3 computers you could use as well as wireless if you had a laptop) We were also able to avoid paying the $28 parking fee by parking across the street at a meter and then making sure we moved our car in the morning.
