[0.7904262542724609] Once inside the hotel it smelled so musty I opened the window in my room to discover it didn't even lock (we had a main floor room, so window locks are a MUST) Husband went to the front desk to complain, maintenance man was able to fix it after at least 45 minute wait.
[0.632537841796875] We stayed with a group recently and all had a good time....the group had experienced problems unrelated to the hotel but when we got there the treatment and service we received was wonderful.....we were made to feel right at home......I believe Joe was the gentleman who greeted us and was very kind and professional.....Maryann (I think that was her name) in the breakfast room was an absolute angel.....she went out of her way to make everyone feel special........this is an excellent choice for groups-affordable......receptive to needs.......Also the in charge cleaning lady was very professional and friendly.

[-0.9434356689453125] Dog was barking in room across the hall all day and night, one of us stepped in dog feces in the parking lot and tracked it into the room :( A group of ill guests vomited just outside the entry door, massive amounts, when we called to ask that it be cleaned up due to health hazards front desk staff was rude!
[-0.9344940185546875] The hotel messed up the Cocktail Hour suite for both nights, and when I called to complain they did NOTHING to make it right, it was so clear that they could actually care less that I was unhappy.
[-0.8039360046386719] They also offered entertainment.
[-0.68511962890625] The wireless internet did not work and we were basically told - "Sorry" and they couldn't do anything about it.
