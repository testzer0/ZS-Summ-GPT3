[0.9211692810058594] Concierge lounge nibbles in the evening were a little disappointing, but the staff were friendly (I think this area used to be the old steak house).
[0.8994464874267578] We are NOT demanding restaurant a patrons, but both the food and the service was poor.
[0.8365821838378906] Food presentation was fancy, but the food didn't taste very good.
[0.411651611328125] I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.
[0.008142471313476562] At over $250 a night, that's not too good.
