[0.9162073135375977] Overall : The Marriott Hotel served a purpose and we had a comfortable stay.
[0.8570137023925781] I have stayed here on 2 separate trips to Toronto in the last 14 months and really enjoyed each stay.
[0.8143196105957031] I recently stayed at Marriott Eaton Center and had a wonderful stay.
[0.7808017730712891] I stayed for three nights at the Marriott Eaton Centre, which I really enjoyed.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9788637161254883] It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.
[-0.9584980010986328] During our recent trip we stayed in 5 hotels in Canada and this was by far the worst.
[-0.9437713623046875] Compared to my last stay, my room was a little disappointing.
[-0.9420928955078125] I will not stay there again.
[-0.8323554992675781] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
