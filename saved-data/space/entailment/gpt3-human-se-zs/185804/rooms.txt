[-0.9840383529663086] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.8839988708496094] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!
[-0.8715972900390625] My rating would have been 5 stars, except the room was quite small for two people 5 days, and the only view was over a roof and hvac unit.
[-0.8494415283203125] The only drawback could be room size as ours was only just adequate and the view was rather restricted.
[-0.7676105499267578] We were told none were available.
