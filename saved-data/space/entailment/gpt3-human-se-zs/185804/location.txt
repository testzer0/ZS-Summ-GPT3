[0.9921846389770508] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[0.0431365966796875] Location wise hard to beat, just a short ferry ride from town and an easy walk over bridge.
[0.0418243408203125] Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes.
[0.008299827575683594] Hop on a nearby ferry to explore downtown, the West End, Yaletown or Chinatown.
[0.003284454345703125] We would eat breakfast in the Market take one of the super cute little ferries over to Vancouver, explore the city and then take a cab back for a peaceful dinner in one of the many very nice restaurants on the island.

[-0.6567049026489258] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.4677238464355469] The place is a bit confusing to drive into at night if you're unfamiliar with the area, but my GPS showed the way.
[-0.3647422790527344] We had a car, so we were able to drive to many places in Vancouver like Stanley Park, Canada Place, Chinatown, Robson Street, Yaletown, etc.
[-0.3514251708984375] We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel because it was close to the Stanley Theatre and a $12 cab fare to downtown.
[-0.31344032287597656] The location of the hotel also makes it easy to have a stroll around Granville Island, but you'll need a taxi to get to the clubs and shopping in the city proper.
