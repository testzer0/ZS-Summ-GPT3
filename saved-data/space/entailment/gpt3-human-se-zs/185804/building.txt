[0.9079093933105469] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.056163787841796875] *The art in the rooms are old and are of Delta, why not GI?
[0.010460853576660156] We went to the Pacific Culinary Institute and that was amazing!
[0.010334014892578125] Nothing a little renovation couldn't quickly take care of.
[0.00516510009765625] The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.

[-0.4943580627441406] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.3649253845214844] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[-0.196380615234375] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
[-0.154052734375] While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
[-0.12796783447265625] There is no easy chair.
