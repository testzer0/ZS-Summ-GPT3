[0.9025583267211914] The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms.
[0.11050033569335938] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
[0.03484153747558594] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
[0.014711380004882812] It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.
[0.010034561157226562] There is an abundance of gardens in between the different buildings and all were very well maintained and tended.
