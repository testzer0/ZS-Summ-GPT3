[0.9408359527587891] Free shuttle to the airport got us to the terminal in about 3 minutes!
[0.9327774047851562] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
[0.9321174621582031] Free shuttle to and from airport helps.

[-0.9647426605224609] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[-0.9013957977294922] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!
[-0.8852386474609375] It looks nice on the outside,, but inside it is very shabby and used.

[0.024120330810546875] We did book directly on the Hilton chain website and got a rate of about $89.
