----- Supporting -----

[0.48688507080078125] We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied.
[0.4755363464355469] We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac.
[0.42945098876953125] Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport.
[0.3505439758300781] We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased.
[0.34113311767578125] Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9879288673400879] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.9835071563720703] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[-0.97930908203125] To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.
[-0.9646234512329102] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).
[-0.9602842330932617] This hotel disappointed.

[0.8554668426513672] The rooms had balconies with a good view.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8554668426513672] I asked for a room in the tower and the room was spacious with a nice king bed and a balcony that overlooked the airport.
[0.8259220123291016] Upgrade to King Corner Room or Penthouse to really treat yourself, balcony are amazing in these rooms.
[0.8010482788085938] Our balcony looked over the pool enhanced with mature Pacific Northwest landscape.
[0.7985954284667969] There was a huge wrap around balcony with a view of the glass elavators and a view of the Cascade Mts.

[0.34296607971191406] The hotel shuttle was convenient.

----- Supporting -----

[0.34296607971191406] Love that the hotel provided a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, every 15-20mins.
[0.16945648193359375] We left our car for 5 days and stayed in this Doubletree Hotel on our return,our shuttle arrived promptly and we were given a Tower Room .
[0.118194580078125] The hotel it's self was huge, but yet it still felt very comfortable.
[0.10390472412109375] Stayed at this hotel beause the park n fly.
[0.100860595703125] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9494609832763672] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
[-0.9364738464355469] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[-0.9146060943603516] The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare.
[-0.910888671875] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[-0.804901123046875] The tower rooms do have balconies but the space is shared with the room next door and divided by a set of austere looking bars--plus there is no furniture to sit on so the balconies are not really functional.

[0.20638275146484375] This is a hotel in the Hilton chain and I was disappointed.....:(

[0.228851318359375] The rooms in the wing hallways were not well-located.

----- Supporting -----

[0.228851318359375] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.

[0.02459716796875] No frig or microwaves in Doubletree hotels, too many pillows on the bed.

[-0.9310874938964844] Was an excellent choice, beautiful hotel and great beds made for a perfect start for vacation.
[-0.9265623092651367] All in all, a nice place to stay before or after the flight.

[0.9372177124023438] The rooms at the hotel have good amenities.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9372177124023438] Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.
[0.8259735107421875] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.8071298599243164] I had booked this hotel due to my previous terrific experience with a very nice room and bath.

[0.1419677734375] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[0.09348297119140625] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.

[-0.9422264099121094] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[-0.8341522216796875] Our room was nice and clean and on the back side (away from street traffic), plus only heard planes when we has the sliding door opened.
[-0.7654800415039062] I have also found that requesting rooms at the end of the hall are quieter.
[-0.7579240798950195] The room was quiet, very comfy beds and we enjoyed the view from the 10th floor; the room and hallways could use an update, but are perfectly adequate.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9984803199768066] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[-0.9981284141540527] The hotel is big and busy, so it always feels like there is some commotion going on in the common areas.
[-0.9977874755859375] --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
[-0.9968376159667969] The crappy wings are old and the rooms smell musty.
[-0.9966535568237305] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.

[-0.8571243286132812] We had dinner in the bar area.
[-0.8312530517578125] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
