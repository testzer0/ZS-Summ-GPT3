[0.9677467346191406] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[0.18889617919921875] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[0.17599868774414062] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
[0.07993316650390625] We were disappointed about the hours of the Charlie Palmer and the bar downstairs but found an outstanding place to get a drink directly across the street.
[0.07208251953125] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
