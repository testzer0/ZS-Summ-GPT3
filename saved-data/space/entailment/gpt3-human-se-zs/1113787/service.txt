[0.5264434814453125] The service at the hotel is sometimes good and sometimes bad.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5264434814453125] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
[0.126220703125] Furthermore, room service was closed at 10 pm, front desk was unhelpful (in ordering a pizza nonetheless) and Charlie Palmer was a waste of time and energy (great staff, HORRIBLE management.)
[0.11489105224609375] The actual service at the front desk seemed a bit patchy, depending on who was there.
[0.10554885864257812] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[0.06707000732421875] It was more than your usual hotel staff friendliness, it was an attitude of liking what they did.
