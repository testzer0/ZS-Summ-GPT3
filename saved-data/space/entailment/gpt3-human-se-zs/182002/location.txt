[0.9737763404846191] The location was good, right where I needed to be, and the price was great for downtown and I only paid $89 with a corporate discount.

[0.8627128601074219] surrounded by great restauants and a healthy walking distance to shops, Air Canada Centre, CN Tower.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.688720703125] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).

[0.958439826965332] It is expensive to park at the hotel.

----- Supporting -----

[0.958439826965332] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.7850494384765625] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.576019287109375] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.449798583984375] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.34435272216796875] The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot!

----- Weakening -----

[0.9884252548217773] The hotel charges for parking.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9884252548217773] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.9671516418457031] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.9329719543457031] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.8572921752929688] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.6549072265625] I couldn't believe they were trying to stick me for a charge when I hadn't been able to park in the garage, the spot was supposed to be free, the spot was recommended by the hotel staff, AND my car was broken into while parked there.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.6778640747070312] They were also kind enough to recommend and make reservations at a lovely restaurant called Ruth Chris (pricey but well worth it if you are a steak lover).
[-0.48095703125] The location was perfect as I walked to the Eaton Centre which was about 10 minutes away, and then the cab ride back only cost $8 including a tip.
[-0.4559478759765625] the one across the street from the "Made in China" chinese restaurant, which was decent cheap eats on it's own!
[-0.436309814453125] Was very safe and you could only access the parking lot with a hotel key.
[-0.3890380859375] The lady in reception was very helpful and kind, she got us a very good room at a reasonable price.
