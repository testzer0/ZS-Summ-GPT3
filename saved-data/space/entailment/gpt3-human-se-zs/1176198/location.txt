[-0.631561279296875] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[-0.2566871643066406] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[-0.2207183837890625] We were on the 9th floor facing West and the view was so-so, but to be honest I wasn't there for the view anyway.
[-0.0888671875] Not near a subway, but no need, we walked everywhere.
[-0.08494186401367188] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!

[0.489532470703125] Main attractions (CN Tower, Skydome) are less than 10 min walk, as they are all the theatre district amenities.
[0.3048973083496094] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!

[-0.18643951416015625] The accessible room was just that - very accessible.
[-0.16990280151367188] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[-0.14151763916015625] The first night was during the huge Caribe fest and it was crazy outside!
[-0.13068771362304688] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[-0.08615875244140625] The location was good for us but it is definitely not the nicest area of town.
