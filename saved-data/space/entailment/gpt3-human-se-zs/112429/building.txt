[0.9723443984985352] Small lobby very intimate but best of all was location.
[0.4915771484375] The lobby has a nice little living room style waiting area but only takes 10 seconds to get through to the elevators.
[0.41070556640625] There is BTW always only one person at front desk, so you can find yourself lining up to get even the simplest things done, like getting a demagnetized card reprogrammed.

[-0.9551277160644531] You donâ€™t walk in to a fancy lobby, but you also donâ€™t have to pay for it.
[-0.9178085327148438] the lobby is sort of lackluster but the rooms were tasfully updated and very clean.

[0.5729446411132812] The building was old and needed repair.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5729446411132812] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.
[0.025429725646972656] The hotel was under exterior renovations, but that worked out for me as I was out of my room for most of the day.
[0.006228446960449219] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.

[-0.4556884765625] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.

[0.47678375244140625] The staff was rude and unhelpful.

[0.47678375244140625] The man who was working at the front desk looked very gruff and mean, when I would ask something he made me feel like I was putting him out.

[-0.9927294254302979] I talked to the front desk and they painlessly arranged for a hotel town car to take me in so I could make my flight on time.
