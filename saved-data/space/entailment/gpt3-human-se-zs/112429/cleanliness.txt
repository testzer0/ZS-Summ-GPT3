[0.9204025268554688] The room was not clean when the reviewer arrived.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9204025268554688] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.
[0.484344482421875] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.233612060546875] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.
[0.20196533203125] I called down to the front desk to find out what time housekeeping would be coming by as I wanted to have a nap before I went to the game.
[0.1778564453125] It was rush hour, so the concierge had to stand out there quite a while to catch one that was empty.

[-0.3941650390625] I had Sake for $1.
[-0.3369903564453125] The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the decor in good taste (lots of texture, neutral tone, and rich burgandy to soothe the spirit).
[-0.272216796875] - The housekeeper walked in on me without knocking at 9 a.m. in the morning when I was getting ready to go in the shower.
[-0.2676239013671875] Lolita was great as well.
[-0.26202392578125] The best thing is they have an empty fridge so you can put all your goodies that you buy from pike place inside

[0.005535125732421875] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
