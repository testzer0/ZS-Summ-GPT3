[0.9841880798339844] Hotel could do with a refurbishment.
[0.12950706481933594] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.008723258972167969] Construction was happening on the exterior of the hotel.
[0.00765228271484375] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
[0.006069183349609375] The renovations that I have been reading about appear to be just about complete.

[-0.1470489501953125] Beautiful lobby!
[-0.1155853271484375] Last night i took it back from Bayside and the car was filled with drunk teens that were looking for a fight.
[-0.0992727279663086] When we finally got to the lobby (because it's a little bit tricky) it was full of people checking in, but everything ran just perfect thanks to the professionalism and friendly attitude of the front desk agents.

[0.1469879150390625] And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor.
[0.0603790283203125] Also lots of construction on the streets make sure you plan to leave a bit early especially on the weekend.

[-0.35772705078125] We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier.
