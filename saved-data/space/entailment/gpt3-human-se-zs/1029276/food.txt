[-0.03691864013671875] I could have spent less in the end and stayed somewhere else.
[-0.04784202575683594] I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
[-0.08026885986328125] A little bit pricy but you are staying at Hilton, so you expected to pay a bit more.

[-0.9812049865722656] Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
