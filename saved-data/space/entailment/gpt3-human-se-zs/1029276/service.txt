[0.3704071044921875] I complained to the "manager" and she told me that it was "their culture".
[0.2433013916015625] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.

[0.7576560974121094] Downtown did not feel safe at all, and there were alot of unsavoury looks as we did walk 4 blocks from the Hotel.
[0.7433395385742188] Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls.
