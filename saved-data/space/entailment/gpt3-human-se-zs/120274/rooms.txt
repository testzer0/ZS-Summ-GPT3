[-0.9188003540039062] I would highly suggest spending more money to stay at a Disney property or a more expensive hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.20333099365234375] Also, the hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast.
[-0.19439697265625] Theres lots of restaurants very close.. a steak house, TGI fridays, outback, subway etc etc.. and a supermarket aswell which was handy.
[-0.173583984375] Three types of cereal, toast and waffles to eat, milk, coffee and juice.
[-0.1566162109375] My only complaint would be the continental breakfast.
[-0.14239501953125] So, on balance, yes, it's cheap if you're on a big budget but, when you balance it all up, unless you're ok with roughing it a bit, you might want to consider paying a few mpore dollars and going for something a little more up-market.
