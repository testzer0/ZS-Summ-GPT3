[0.0443878173828125] The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the decor in good taste (lots of texture, neutral tone, and rich burgandy to soothe the spirit).
[0.005069732666015625] The decor fits well with the holidays.
[0.002162933349609375] Lolita was great as well.

[-0.9862842559814453] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[-0.9751324653625488] I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.
[-0.9262018203735352] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.
[-0.9184970855712891] The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.
[-0.7411422729492188] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
