[-0.9977970123291016] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.976111888885498] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.

[-0.0034694671630859375] Portland is a great city to visit, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
[-0.0064697265625] Designwise, it could be any hotel in any city.
[-0.007053375244140625] It was within walking distance to shopping and entertainment in Capitol Hill.
[-0.0084381103515625] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9958689212799072] The man who was working at the front desk looked very gruff and mean, when I would ask something he made me feel like I was putting him out.
[-0.992903470993042] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.9875928163528442] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.
[-0.9851318597793579] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[-0.9840807914733887] My desk chair was broken and I asked for it to be replaced or fixed.
