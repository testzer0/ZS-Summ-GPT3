[0.0004730224609375] The food was not great, but it was convenient and allowed for quick happy hours and taking food upstairs.

----- Supporting -----

[0.0004730224609375] Overpriced though.
[-0.0001220703125] It'll cost you $3.50, they don't bring sugar or cream, and you can get the same bag of tea in the little coffee maker kit in the bathroom for free.
[-0.0001697540283203125] Overall, great experience at a way better price than other downtown hotels.
[-0.0014095306396484375] I'd stay here again for the right price, but I wouldn't pay the full fare.
[-0.0014171600341796875] I would stay here again if the price was cheaper than other hotels in the area.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7278289794921875] The choice of channels for the tv is terrible....for the amount you pay this place you should get more than 20 channels....the only thing great about this place is the water pressure.
[-0.14729690551757812] I far rather prefer the individual bottles.
[-0.09102249145507812] It had obviously been sitting somewhere since it was barely warm.
[-0.06382179260253906] I didn't try it, but it doesn't look appetizing.
[-0.0595703125] Coffee in the morning.
