----- Weakening -----

[-0.9865131378173828] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.8716678619384766] This is a small place and they react quickly.
[-0.8306369781494141] It is on the edge of downtown, with parking lots and demolition going on across the street on one side and the Hyatt on the other.
[-0.6490249633789062] Be warned - you can walk to Pike Place Market from here, but the trip back to the hotel has a vicious hill - wear good shoes or be prepared to take a cab.
[-0.6098270416259766] Cons 1- No view really.
