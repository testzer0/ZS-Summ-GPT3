[-0.0010194778442382812] Tons of little restaurants, small shops (not big retail stores), kind of an artsy feel.
[-0.004585742950439453] I found this hotel to have a better rate then others in downtown Toronto (which is not the same as saying it's cheap).
[-0.0069026947021484375] I really don't have anything bad to say about this hotel, the price is a little steep per night but it is definitely worth it.
[-0.0072021484375] Fresh fruit and fruit juices, breads and pastries, and coffee brought to the table rather than stewed out of a communal urn.
[-0.008267402648925781] There's good coffee nearby (I'm fairly sure that they didn't offer breakfast).

[-0.07832717895507812] At check in we got to help ourselves to the complimentary cookies which were very delicious.
[-0.07761383056640625] The food at dinner was very good and the breakfast that was included with the room package was excellent.
[-0.06389236450195312] The price is very reasonabe and the quality of the food was great.
[-0.05079078674316406] So you can pack a couple of apples or muffins for later in the day and save yourself some more money on food!
[-0.04182243347167969] There was even a decent wine selction and a waiter that offered reliable advice.

[-0.0026679039001464844] The only thing i would not recommend is eating at the hotel; with as many restaurants nearby, go out.
