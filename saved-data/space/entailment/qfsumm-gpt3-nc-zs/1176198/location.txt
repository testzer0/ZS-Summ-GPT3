[0.7804222106933594] Overall, reviewers thought the location was great.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7804222106933594] We really enjoyed our stay here, it is in good location in the Entertainment district, and though we didn't try the restauant or breakfast it looked very good!
[0.6990280151367188] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.6331329345703125] We liked so many thinga about this Hilton, but probably the best is LOCATION.
[0.5941009521484375] Great rates, Great location, friendly staff.
[0.5934295654296875] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.264739990234375] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[-0.17055892944335938] You can self-park but being right downtown I figured it wasn't worth the hassle to save a few bucks.
[-0.09393310546875] Didn't try the restaurant.
[-0.09033203125] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[-0.055389404296875] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.

[0.006299018859863281] I slept in many hotels downtown Toronto, and I can say this new Hilton hotel is the best one.
[0.0007114410400390625] Loved the area around this hotel, we had stayed around the Dundas area the previous week and this was much better.
[0.0005779266357421875] A great place for a family of four (2 children under 10).
[-0.00234222412109375] The second floor restaurant area was lovely and the service at breakfast could not have been better.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9790363311767578] It is convenient to a nearby Shopper's Drug Mart (to pick up some in room snacks) and a large LCBO with a rather big Vintages section for some excellent wine for the room.
[-0.9698371887207031] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[-0.9048194885253906] The first night was during the huge Caribe fest and it was crazy outside!
[-0.8757038116455078] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[-0.8621211051940918] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.

**********

[-0.008743762969970703] They did not like that there was no housekeeping/maid service, and that the kitchen was closed.

----- Supporting -----

[-0.008743762969970703] There was a slight mix up with our booking but no fuss was made although I did find the reception staff a little disinterested but nothing to spoil my stay.
[-0.009302139282226562] Three of us stayed for two nights on a hectic trip, arriving on an overnight flight from the States.
[-0.010230064392089844] Paid $35.00 to park overnight across the street.
[-0.015630722045898438] Will stay at the real Hilton the next time!
[-0.017827987670898438] I was sick the last day and my husband and son ditched me to tour around.

[-0.9749059677124023] Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.

[-0.8611106872558594] Lot's of bars and restaurants nearby and plenty of local mini-markets for day to day necessities.
[-0.837620735168457] Close to lots of restaurants, a Whole Foods and two streetcar lines making it easy to get around.
[-0.8348922729492188] The palaver with the change in the restaurant was the only niggle and although it was a little comical, I can imagine it would become very irritating if it happened more than once.

[0.0025262832641601562] They also thought that the guest policy was not ideal.

----- Supporting -----

[0.0025262832641601562] I would avoid the restaurant in the hotel as the service is slow and inconsistent.
[0.0017490386962890625] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.0013952255249023438] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[-4.9591064453125e-05] The location was good for us but it is definitely not the nicest area of town.
[-0.0010242462158203125] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.5989265441894531] Great place to stay if you are going out to party you can walk back to the hotel.
[-0.5819110870361328] The rooms are equal to anything Hilton offers, the fitness facility is first rate and the restaurant staff are friendly and attentive - to the right degree.
[-0.5440959930419922] Excellent location!
[-0.5282649993896484] Well done Hilton!
[-0.511260986328125] Fantastic location (OK they are renewing the old fashion district in the downtown core) but this hotel is quite wonderful !
