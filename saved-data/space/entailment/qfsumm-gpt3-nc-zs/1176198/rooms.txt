[0.7489013671875] The room was a decent size, but most importantly it was very clean and nicely updated with granite counter tops.
[0.7123126983642578] The room was very clean w/ very new furnishings.
[0.6746253967285156] Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.
[0.5342178344726562] The rooms are modern, very clean and have many more amenities than one expects, including fridge, microwave, large HDTV, adjustable bed, spacious bathroom and, if upgrading, a wonderful Jacuzzi.

[-0.9424524307250977] My boyfriend and I stayed here this past weekend january 21-23 and the people were nice not that we were in the hotel to much other than to sleep but the bed was absolutely awful it was like sleeping on a board.

[-0.9350547790527344] we were so tired and sore from bad sleep we went home early on monday without shopping or anything the room was kind of plain we had the room with a jacuzzi and fireplace but both nights when we were in bed sleeping the jacuzzi mysteriously turned on and woke us both up and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off.

[0.8265380859375] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.

[-0.757258415222168] Try not to get a room on that side, even high up.
[-0.7399682998657227] I truly disliked the bed.
[-0.6811237335205078] Unfortunately, we made the wrong decision on where to stay.
[-0.6569633483886719] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.
