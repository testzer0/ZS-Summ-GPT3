[-0.009624481201171875] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.

[-0.027313232421875] I did hear them but maybe I just expect that city hum, having grown up in NY.
