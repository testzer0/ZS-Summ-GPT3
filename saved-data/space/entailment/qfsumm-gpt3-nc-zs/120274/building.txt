[0.508575439453125] Ok so the furniture was a bit tired but stuff worked, plenty of hot water and there was a microwave and fridge in the room.
[0.05051994323730469] I would certainly reccomend this property to anyone who desires a comfortable "sleeper" at a great price
[0.0430450439453125] The person at the front desk met all are requests... a quiet room away from the traffic.
[0.0072479248046875] When we arrived, although the front desk staff could not find our reservation, I showed them my confirmation sheet and they fixed everything.
[0.00566864013671875] We have been to this complex a number of times.

[-0.9579353332519531] The property though was not nice at all.
[-0.9416351318359375] The furniture, i.e tv unit and clothes drawers seemed to be the only thing that seemed a little tired, but not so much that you would notice.
[-0.4210205078125] A car will definitely be handy.
[-0.37481689453125] We would have struggled without the hire car so I would advise you to get one!
[-0.18121337890625] A must is a car because travelling around on foot is hard the roads are really hard to cross you take your life into your own hands and wait up to 15 mins for the lights to change and watch the traffic from the right because while your crossing they are too.
