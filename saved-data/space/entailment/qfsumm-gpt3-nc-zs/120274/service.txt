[-0.9972734451293945] his hotel was had very disappointing customer service and staff.
[-0.9932806491851807] The hotel refused to match multiple lower rates I had found elsewhere, so I decided to cancel due to unhelpful reservation services and reserve a hotel I KNOW has superior customer service.
[-0.9898054599761963] I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!

[-0.001617431640625] The location was a little out of the way, but it was only 5 minutes from Disney.

[-0.60858154296875] Don't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney!
[-0.5531005859375] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
[-0.45164012908935547] Pros: - The room was spacy & clean - The pool was warm and fun to swim in - Friendly staff - Good location (next to some great shops!)
[-0.2930126190185547] It is just a free service.
[-0.189483642578125] Close to parks...free shuttle to attractions but buses get full fast, they pick up at other hotels along the way.
