[0.6461915969848633] The hotel is very good, with decent sized rooms, great prices and excellent service!
[0.5240039825439453] Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
[0.4686393737792969] The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.
[0.46849822998046875] Most everything else about the hotel was great as well - the size of our room, the friendly staff, a great dinner and breakfast, again with outstanding views from the dining room.
[0.317596435546875] All the rooms have some view of the water and although they are small and expensive it is worth it.

[-0.8068971633911133] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.
[-0.7454233169555664] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.5465850830078125] We stayed in 6 hotels in all and this was by no means the cheapest, but it was the least appealing.
[-0.5034408569335938] It was an acceptable hotel, but definitely not worth the outlandish price.
[-0.48534393310546875] We were told none were available.

[0.009363174438476562] Some prints on the walls were not to everyone's taste, but the public spaces were nicely decorated.

[0.009363174438476562] The rooms were well appointed.
[0.007427215576171875] I discovered the fantastic European-influenced, waterfront, dog-friendly Granville Island Hotel and have been back every year for Christmas Eve through Boxing Day ever since (with one exception.)
[0.0054416656494140625] Those small issues aside, this is a lovely hotel in a great area, close to the attractions of Vancouver yet far enough away to provide solace.
[0.005440711975097656] It was huge, comfortable ,clean, nicely decorated and with great views over the boats of False Creek.
[0.0048351287841796875] Secondly, the room was well equipped, the decor tasteful and the bed was extremely comfortable.

[-0.11908912658691406] Just somewhere to sleep.
[-0.10562515258789062] We were told none were available.
[-0.07784271240234375] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.074249267578125] * The doors, wallpaper and carpets need to be redone.

[0.6507415771484375] There was a view from the room (at least in some cases), and the location was both convenient and away from traffic.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6507415771484375] Our room was on the ground floor, and I was initially worried it might be noisy as it had a view of the waiter's water station for the outside patio, but in fact it was very quiet, and we could glimpse the water through the shrubs which preserved our privacy, as well as people-watching.
[0.48499298095703125] Got room twice the sz with a balcony & view - MUCH better :-) This is close to everything,GR8 4 kids, couples, walking, hopping, coffee, food, farmer's market, easy acess to bridges, residential, ferries across water to downtown, yaletown, science world.
[0.45328521728515625] The end room is great because even though it's small, 2 walls are window-sliders to balconies overlooking ritzy boats and water traffic.
[0.4396858215332031] The balcony had impressive views and was private, the suite was huge and very comfortable.
[0.39666748046875] It's in a perfect location, it's been recently updated, it's very clean, it has a lovely patio to enjoy the views from, it's located on Granville Island with it's many charming spots to shop, dine and enjoy the fabulous farmers market, it really couldn't be better.

[-0.0650177001953125] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!
