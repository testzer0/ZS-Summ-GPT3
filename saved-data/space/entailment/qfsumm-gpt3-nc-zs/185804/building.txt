[-0.000682830810546875] *The art in the rooms are old and are of Delta, why not GI?

----- Weakening -----

[-0.6836175918579102] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[-0.6679019927978516] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.296844482421875] Bad Points * half renovated the common areas are nice, the bathrooms have no bath tubs but new bathrooms.
[-0.29460906982421875] There is no easy chair.
[-0.19533920288085938] The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.

[-0.04845714569091797] We went to the Pacific Culinary Institute and that was amazing!
[-0.03177070617675781] He was very impressed and requested a tour of the brewery, which the brew-master provided for him.
[-0.02783966064453125] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[-0.02459716796875] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
[-0.023281097412109375] While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
