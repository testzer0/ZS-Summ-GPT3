[0.5731582641601562] The reviews said that the location was great with lovely views, close to attractions but far enough away to provide peace, and with lots of shopping and great food options.

[0.5731582641601562] There is great restaurants close by, downtown is easily accessible, you have an amazing view of the city and the mountains, and you can have a quite night of sleep!
[0.30106353759765625] The location is the biggest draw for us, Granville Island by day is full of energy, a great place to pick up something tasty at the Public Market, find a seat, listen to the buskers and people watch.
[0.166717529296875] The location is amazing, Granville Island is a tourist hotspot, filled with art galleries and a indoors farmers market which is a must see and great place for lunch.
[0.06512832641601562] We would eat breakfast in the Market take one of the super cute little ferries over to Vancouver, explore the city and then take a cab back for a peaceful dinner in one of the many very nice restaurants on the island.
[0.0609893798828125] Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market.

[-0.9848003387451172] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[-0.9584789276123047] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.8971385955810547] There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.
[-0.6762781143188477] We held our wedding reception at the Hotel's lounge and found that we were overall very disappointed.
[-0.5842771530151367] The hotel restaurant merits only 3*, with slightly above average food (also expensive) .

[-0.0025920867919921875] The hotel restaraunt was ok, not outstanding but pretty good.
[-0.0038661956787109375] Overall, I really liked the place and would return.
[-0.005984306335449219] But it was great actually being based on Granville Island.

[-0.0073871612548828125] The Marina was great to take a short ride around False Creek.

[-0.8747634887695312] One of the drawbacks of staying on Granville Island is the parking - almost impossible at the weekend, even after paying the hotel $7 for a pass that allows you to park beyond the normal 3 hour limit.
[-0.7046623229980469] There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.
[-0.6435508728027344] Parking is a problem, and you will probably need to use the valet parking available at the hotel which costs $7.
[-0.5849723815917969] Chips and salsa *The restaurant deck is very nice and modern and quite a gem....too bad about the service and the food.
[-0.46987152099609375] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
