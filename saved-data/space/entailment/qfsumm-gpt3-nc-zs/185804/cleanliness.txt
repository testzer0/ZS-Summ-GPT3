----- Weakening -----

[-0.9716243743896484] Otherwise, the decor and furnishings are a little tired and dated.
[-0.8714141845703125] Our only real disappontment was when we walked around Gastown, which really seems to have got shabby since our last visit.
[-0.8024539947509766] * Lamp had burnt out light bulb...not a big deal but these things should be checked upon cleaning.
[-0.701629638671875] *The shampoo was in a ridiculous size bottle and if anyone figures out how to get it out of the bottle I would love to know.
[-0.3680076599121094] And the most annoying: the room lighting is poor, in particular the reading light.
