[-0.8056621551513672] Keep your children away from these set ups, they are going to injure someone terribly!
[-0.6141996383666992] We would not stay here again because of the noise and mildew.
[-0.32422828674316406] When you finally reach your room the heaters all make tremendous noise, rattle, rumble.
[-0.17069053649902344] No facilities were open early next morning when we were headed for our flight (surprising in such a location where there were lots of people headed for early flights) and although there seem to be a lot of valet staff around, none of them made any effort to assist.
[-0.13218307495117188] We put the A/C on 60 and the room immediately heated the room up 89 degrees.
