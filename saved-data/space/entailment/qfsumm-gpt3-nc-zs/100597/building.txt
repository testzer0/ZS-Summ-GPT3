[0.02651214599609375] The building was clean, the beds were fine, the hotel is located across the street from the airport, within walking distance to a Denny's, Jack in the Box, and a steak place.

[0.02651214599609375] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
[0.010669708251953125] Will stay there again in the future.
[0.007693767547607422] Overall this is a good property.
[0.0005950927734375] As a Doubletree, I expected a GOOD three star property for my stay on August 27, 2004.
[-0.0008544921875] It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.

[-0.9967913627624512] This property is a mess.
[-0.8954200744628906] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
[-0.7478408813476562] The tower elevators, which run on the exterior of the building, were quite cold.
[-0.6498680114746094] I was put into this property by an airline due to a maintenance issue, although I checked in late at night and had to leave early the next morning, I saw enough that I want to return!
[-0.3496971130371094] One wing building was closed for renovation.

[0.09893035888671875] I went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and I had what I needed - nice touch.
[0.012205123901367188] Overall this is a good property.
