----- Supporting -----

[0.3588066101074219] Everything was spotlessly clean and comfortable and the staff were very helpful and polite.
[0.28070068359375] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!
[0.17588233947753906] The staff were very friendly and cheery and the kids also liked the Tim Hortons in the lobby for the donuts.
[0.160858154296875] The staff were really cool and the place was in a good location.
[0.15777969360351562] Spend the extra money and stay somewhere clean with friendly service.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9973104000091553] The staff were rude and quite useless, they just seemed annoyed and unwilling to help no matter how polite we were.
[-0.9858651161193848] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[-0.9855575561523438] The front desk staff were very unfriendly and always seemed to make matters overly complicated.
[-0.9735565185546875] Rude appearing staff.
[-0.9708385467529297] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.

[-0.0002307891845703125] I was also glad that the hotel had free internet access as I had to spend a great deal of time working, and not having to lug everything to a computer room instead of working from my bedroom was very convenient.
[-0.0002727508544921875] It appeared to be a well managed facility.
[-0.00037384033203125] The staff were pleasant and assisted in getting taxis for me when needed.
[-0.0005025863647460938] The service was good and everyone seemed very friendly and helpful.

[-0.4199638366699219] In my entire life, I have never been treated in such a rude, disrespecting manner.
[-0.3147621154785156] You'll get on for a couple minutes and then it will flake out and you'll spend the next 10 minutes trying to reconnect.
[-0.2500267028808594] It was so slow it was practically useless.
[-0.1724700927734375] The room we payed for with internet access, didn't have internet access.
[-0.12499237060546875] I was actually scared to the point I told my boss I didn't want to stay there.
