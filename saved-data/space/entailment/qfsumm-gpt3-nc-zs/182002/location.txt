[0.06290435791015625] The location was praised for being close to a subway station, as well as being in walking distance to a large mall and what is described as Toronto's equivalent of Times Square.

[0.06290435791015625] The place was in a good location and I was able to walk to a huge mall and what I guess is Torontoâ€™s equivalent of Times Square.
[0.01523590087890625] Close to CN tower too!
[0.0037250518798828125] There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.
[0.0027294158935546875] All in all, a great place to go for some fun times in Toronto!
[0.0022258758544921875] Was a nice place.

[-0.9109792709350586] Heed this warning stay away from this crappy place, you'll be glad you did.
[-0.8924121856689453] The next day when we moved into the garage the attendant said we should never have parked in the previous location because everyone should know that your car would be a target there.
[-0.6491565704345703] THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.
[-0.551478385925293] When at the restaurant, they gave me catchup that was so rancid it bubbled.
[-0.5118951797485352] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).
