[0.023019790649414062] The reviews said that the Primrose was a good hotel for people who plan on staying just a few days in Toronto and that it was clean, modern, and staff were friendly and helpful.

----- Supporting -----

[0.023019790649414062] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!
[0.00475311279296875] It was quickley rectified and someone brought me a new iron within minuets.
[0.0026073455810546875] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[0.00103759765625] Tim Hortons right in the lobby which was very convenient.
[0.00020599365234375] They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9956233501434326] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.
[-0.9751524925231934] The beds were comfortable and the sheets good quality but the furniture is pretty dated and the bathroom very tired looking.
[-0.6373634338378906] Our car was broken into.
[-0.5980186462402344] We had many people coming for this conference that had scratched their cars or some that cracked their exhaust pipe.
[-0.42026710510253906] You might also get stuck in the elevator, though the manager said that it happens all the time.

[-0.009171247482299805] The only concern that was raised was the limited parking in the hotel garage.

[-0.009171247482299805] The property was much better then I expected.

[-0.03114795684814453] It appears this hotel also serves as a university residence, but there was no noise issue with that.
