[0.345062255859375] Staff was extra friendly, room was large and clean, had a great view of the city and we were walking distance to just about everything.
[0.31964111328125] Room was spacious, spotlessly clean and I had a great view of the Toronto skyline from the 19th floor.
[0.2460174560546875] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.

[-0.9981496334075928] Although most of the staff were nice, the rooms were dated and could use some renovation.
[-0.9975242614746094] The rooms are old, the bathroom smelled, we had a view of air conditioners and the gym was a joke.
[-0.9962818622589111] The rooms are tired with many defects (both my rooms had faults including bulbs out, loose headboard and loose bathroom fittings.
[-0.9961593151092529] Nothing in the room felt clean and I agree with one reviewer that the bed "crunched".
[-0.994356632232666] The room was so filthy, we decided to leave, and find another hotel.

[0.0881805419921875] The only issue I did not like was that the fan in the bathroom automatically turns on when you turn on the light, and usually my wife likes to sleep with the bathroom light on, but we didnâ€™t as the fan would be running.

[0.033606529235839844] Other than that, we were most pleased with the hotel and hope to return again on our 40th.
[0.03263092041015625] Well, with the exception of the bathroom.
[0.03005218505859375] My suggestion for the hotel though is try to get a room away from the elevator.
