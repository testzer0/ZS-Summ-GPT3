[0.0484619140625] Overall, reviewers thought the Hilton was fine for business travelers, with a great location near the airport and port.

----- Supporting -----

[0.0484619140625] Taxi brought us to South Beach and the terminals within 15mins and there will always be taxi.
[0.017431259155273438] I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
[0.011594772338867188] Staff were real helpful and friendly, no faults there.
[0.011089324951171875] Service was good, nothing to complain about.
[0.00926971435546875] Other travellers we spoke to experienced the same.

[-0.6599340438842773] Not impressed.
[-0.6504487991333008] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.
[-0.5822153091430664] I called often and continued to get unsatisfactory answers.
[-0.43971824645996094] The guy who came said it was the city's problem and left.
[-0.41295909881591797] I will be not be staying at this hotel again and if you want a good nights sleep at a hotel with a friendly staff I recommend you don't either.

[0.019855499267578125] However, some found the rates to be very high, especially for breakfast, and felt that the hotel was not suitable for a holiday stay.

----- Supporting -----

[0.019855499267578125] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
[0.01634979248046875] Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing.
[-0.000274658203125] Traveled to Miami in January for business and stayed at the Hilton Downtown because the conference was being held at the same hotel.
[-0.00046539306640625] We finally spoke to one front desk manager who compensated us for one nights stay because of our troubles.
[-0.00078582763671875] I complained to the "manager" and she told me that it was "their culture".

[-0.18686485290527344] so I would like to say thx to all staff and especiall to fernando for this great service, that's one of the reason why we will come again soon... it was the first and definitely not the last time.
[-0.1651287078857422] They do nothing but assist in the situation.
[-0.16032791137695312] They just said they ran out.
[-0.1342916488647461] Taking the train toward downtown is free and a five minute ride to the famous Bayside Marketplace --- which is a must do!
[-0.12746429443359375] $25 taxi from Miami airport.

**********

[0.1476898193359375] Housekeeping was also mentioned as an issue by some.

----- Supporting -----

[0.1476898193359375] I feel the housekeeping staff is totaly at fault, and needs better supervision.
[0.082763671875] They would leave dirty glasses and leave new ones and they did not change the sheets.
[0.0281219482421875] We needed extra pillows and towels - to our room in 10 minutes with a smile.
[0.00649261474609375] We felt that an establishment of this nature in this location and carrying the Hilton brand should have made staff available to man the lounge at the times stated.
[0.001922607421875] The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.19278717041015625] The rooms are really nice and clean and the staff is amazing.
[-0.1596527099609375] We asked for Towels - 5 minutes later they were there We had room service - said it would take 25 minutes - was there in 15 We needed more pillows - there in 10 minutes Housekeeping was a pleasure and our room was always made up early.
[-0.10729217529296875] Pros: friendly staff, clean rooms
[-0.06636428833007812] Excellent service.
[-0.05544281005859375] All you need to do is hop on the bus or metromover which is almost outside the door!
