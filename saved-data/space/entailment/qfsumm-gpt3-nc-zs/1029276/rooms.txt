[0.6324005126953125] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace
[0.04177093505859375] However the Hotel has an old feel to it and the surrounding areas outside the hotel was a bit rundown and had a grimy feel.
[0.0338897705078125] The hotel needs to seriously upgrade its rooms to be in par with other establishments.
[0.02994537353515625] The hotel is old and needs some updating in several areas.
[0.02093505859375] I would call this a four star hotel that's slightly rough around the edges.

[0.7002487182617188] This is a very large hotel and very busy with many international guest (we overheard many languages spoken) and eventhough the staff was VERY busy they all had a great attitude and friendly demeanor.
[0.477630615234375] Pool area although at roof level and could be quite a haven staff appeared once again overwhelmed at busy times - could not keep on top of towel demand and allowed guests to bring bottles/glasses into the pool area.
[0.14430999755859375] The hotel was full and jumping with lively but good natured Colts fans and had a fantastic atmosphere.

[0.12115478515625] It did seem that it was full of business people and a couple of seminars taking place but this meant the bar was lively on the evening and the pool area was very quiet during the day so we could soak up the sun with just a couple of other people around :) Overall I would definately recommend this hotel and also stay again if we return to Miami
