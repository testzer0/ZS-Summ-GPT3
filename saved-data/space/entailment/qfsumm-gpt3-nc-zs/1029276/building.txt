[0.0053691864013671875] Overall, the reviews were positive, with people noting the convenient location near the airport and port of Miami.

----- Supporting -----

[0.0053691864013671875] We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier.
[0.00246429443359375] Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards.
[0.0019207000732421875] A design genius put this hotel together clearly.
[0.001361846923828125] Beautiful lobby!
[0.000484466552734375] When we finally got to the lobby (because it's a little bit tricky) it was full of people checking in, but everything ran just perfect thanks to the professionalism and friendly attitude of the front desk agents.

[-0.11596298217773438] The central fire station is located a few blocks down from this hotel.
[-0.07275962829589844] Last night i took it back from Bayside and the car was filled with drunk teens that were looking for a fight.
[-0.06737136840820312] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[-0.04149627685546875] The elevator dinged all night long keeping up the entire family.
[-0.03424358367919922] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.

[0.0003223419189453125] It is by no means a South Beach property (thankfully).

[-0.07042503356933594] Also lots of construction on the streets make sure you plan to leave a bit early especially on the weekend.
[-0.05045032501220703] But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking.

[-0.001049041748046875] However, some reviewers found the rates to be expensive, particularly for breakfast, which was not included in the room rate.

[-0.0012407302856445312] The downtown is a ghost town except for a couple of hotels and Bayside.
[-0.00164794921875] Ä±t has an interesting entrance you take a lift to 3 floor above to enter the lobby from the valet service but still not tiring.

[-0.02313232421875] The renovations were the least of our worries.
