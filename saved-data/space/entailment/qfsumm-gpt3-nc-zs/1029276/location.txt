[0.18100738525390625] The location of the Hilton Miami Downtown was praised by reviewers for being perfect for those traveling for business or pleasure.

[0.18100738525390625] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
[0.03536224365234375] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!
[0.030000686645507812] Location was great 200 yds from Omni station for free Metro Mover + local bus station ($2 one way anywhere on route).
[0.009807586669921875] The location was good, very close to the Bayside area and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach.
[0.007380485534667969] Close to a mall and generally well situated if you are in Miami for business.

[-0.9603366851806641] The Hotel is good - the location is not.
[-0.9347853660583496] The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace.
[-0.9246540069580078] I did not like the area the hotel was in i would of prefered south beach area.
[-0.9186053276062012] One of the downsides to this motel is the location.
[-0.9106807708740234] The location is less than optimal - the northern edge of Downtown.

[0.046855926513671875] This was an expensive option, but it was convenient since neither of us in the party was familiar with Miami.
[0.04473114013671875] Not a terrible place, but I have to say that I've stayed in nicer places that are less expensive.
[0.03119659423828125] When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore.
[0.0113525390625] Great value for the money we spent and not that far from airport.
[0.0047779083251953125] Valet parking was very pricy ($ 28) but very efficient.

[-0.1411590576171875] Would never stay here again and maybe not at another Hilton either.
[-0.0296783447265625] Even though we booked on a discount site, we felt like important guests.
[-0.019710540771484375] DO NOT walk too far from this Hotel.
[-0.01806640625] Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs.
[-0.017963409423828125] Weather was terrible, never so cold in Miami since 1930.
