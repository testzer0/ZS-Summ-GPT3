[-0.000812530517578125] The reviews said that the food was fine if you were a business traveler, but that it was very pricey if you were staying there for holidays.

[-0.000812530517578125] I could have spent less in the end and stayed somewhere else.
[-0.0011997222900390625] Cold fat soaked bacon, processed meats, and very expensive.
[-0.0014872550964355469] Also a salad place and sandwich shop just past 19th St (hotel is on 16th).
[-0.0015802383422851562] There are just a few fast-food eateries near the entrance of the hotel.
[-0.0016560554504394531] Other food in the lounge was good (fruit, coffee).

[-0.9163980484008789] There is no food or entertainment around.
[-0.6338891983032227] Had a great internet deal we found on hilton.com for the website, so we were able to stay there for under $65 a night.
[-0.31497955322265625] Too many hobos and drug addicts!!!
[-0.17101669311523438] Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.
[-0.1324777603149414] I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.

[0.4308319091796875] The hotel is very clean, the staff professional - and the food - simply amazing.
[0.14516067504882812] The food at the restaurant was excellent and the service was great.
[0.06195068359375] We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.
