[-0.9980523586273193] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9979228973388672] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.
[-0.9973912239074707] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[-0.9806842803955078] 2 - We stayed in the Demi-Joule room and it was very small.
[-0.96002197265625] The gym is okay, but somewhat small.

[0.04644775390625] The views from the room were not great, but the room itself was good.

[0.04644775390625] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[0.0428466796875] My only complaint about our room was that one side faced east and the bathroom window was not adequately covered so the morning sun lit up the whole room.
[0.032779693603515625] The rooms are awesome except for the lack of privacy in the toilets that others have mentioned.
[0.031482696533203125] The room product is gorgeous and the beds are extremely comfortable.
[0.027231216430664062] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".

[-0.7574920654296875] The master bedroom was beautiful, comfortable and had great views of downtown Dallas.
[-0.7075538635253906] An Infinity pool hangs over Main Street providing for a unique panorama of downtown Dallas.
