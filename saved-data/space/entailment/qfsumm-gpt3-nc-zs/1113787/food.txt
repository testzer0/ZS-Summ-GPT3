[0.09210205078125] As an order of french toast was around $20 I decided to walk down the street (out the front, down one block to left, take a left and Seven Eleven was on the right) and get a donut and some milk.
[-0.0037994384765625] I only ordered a pot of coffee for 7am.
[-0.0044155120849609375] Plus my husband doesn't drink and I'm 6 mths pregnant, so pretty sure we didn't access any alcohol at the mini bar.
