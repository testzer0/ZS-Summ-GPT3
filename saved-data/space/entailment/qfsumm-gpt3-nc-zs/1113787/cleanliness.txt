----- Weakening -----

[-0.9141902923583984] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.8657736778259277] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.3964805603027344] I had two problems with this place, first when I arrived home the day of our last stay I reviewed the invoice which had been emailed to me and was charged $202.00 for a dinner at Charlie Palmers, but we never dined at Charlie Palmers.
[-0.3146991729736328] I know this could happen anywhere but in years of valet parking it hasnt so this was quite annoying.
[-0.2607288360595703] Well let me start by stating, Tripadvisor isn't such a friendly review system.
