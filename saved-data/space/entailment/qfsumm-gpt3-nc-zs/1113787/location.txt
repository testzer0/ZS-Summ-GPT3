[0.0673065185546875] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[0.00643157958984375] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[0.0042858123779296875] Only little tiny thing is the location ...
[0.0033750534057617188] The actual floor space is less than other hotels, but still sufficient.
[0.003078460693359375] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
