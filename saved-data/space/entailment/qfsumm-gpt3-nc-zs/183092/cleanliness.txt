----- Weakening -----

[-0.9886226654052734] other issues- bathroom really not that nice, concierge horrible at recommending things to do or good resutarants or giving directions.
[-0.9774885177612305] I was concerned about a recent report of bedbugs at this hotel on another website, and so I was prepared to cancel our reservation.
[-0.9492645263671875] My biggest negative would be the super thin, over starched towels.
[-0.7927970886230469] Poor QC here.
[-0.6866111755371094] This hotel has a slow parking garage elevator and forces you to call housekeeping if you want your bedding changed.
