[0.7596874237060547] Overall, reviewers thought the location was good.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7596874237060547] As most people have already noted, the location is fantastic!
[0.603759765625] The location was an excellent one for us because our event was just across the street, but we also walked to dinner on Queen Street, had many shopping choices (itâ€™s connected to the Eaton Centre, or you can meander along funky Queen West) and itâ€™s close to the subway.
[0.574737548828125] We chose this hotel for its location, which is excellent, as you can walk everywhere from there.
[0.4606208801269531] This hotel has a great location and allowed us to walk to all places we wanted to go.
[0.395477294921875] No disappointments, location is absolutely perfect.

[-0.23432540893554688] The restaurant is not very good, so I would not eat in the restaurant unless you have to.
[-0.1309051513671875] My only negative comment about the room was the view - it looked straight into an adjacent office building.
[-0.09122467041015625] If you have children under 8 they will love the fairground at centreville on the islands but avoid Wonderland unless you have teenage children who can go by themselves, the queues were over an hour long for many rides and it feels bleak and bland.
[-0.07427978515625] It looked like we were lucky to get a parking spot.
[-0.02264404296875] Restaurant OK but slow; nothing special.

[-0.9438285827636719] If you have children under 8 they will love the fairground at centreville on the islands but avoid Wonderland unless you have teenage children who can go by themselves, the queues were over an hour long for many rides and it feels bleak and bland.

[0.0036945343017578125] I book in advance so I don't get stuck at other hotels.
[-0.00028133392333984375] It was a nice hotel, but I would recommend staying closer to the center of activities.
[-0.0005207061767578125] I made the mistake of chhosing the Eatons Center location over the Bloor or Airport locations I usually stay at.
[-0.0009365081787109375] The hotel was (obviously) part of the Eaton Centre so shopping and public transport were just steps away.
[-0.0011587142944335938] The hotel staff may act like they don't know where it is... but it's on Queen St. For some reason, when we asked about it, they acted like they never heard of it - but it was packed, and they have awesome food!
