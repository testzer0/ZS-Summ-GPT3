[0.669434666633606] The hotel is old and needs some updating in several areas.
[0.6671236753463745] You may stayed at other modern hotels around the world and you will find it this hotel is a little bit dated.
[0.6070057153701782] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[0.6047447919845581] Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business.

[0.5237345695495605] The Hilton Honors lounge had a very nice breakfast available but it seemed that the superivisor was the only one who took the initiative to clean tables, so was hard to find a clean one.
[0.4909854829311371] Pool area although at roof level and could be quite a haven staff appeared once again overwhelmed at busy times - could not keep on top of towel demand and allowed guests to bring bottles/glasses into the pool area.
