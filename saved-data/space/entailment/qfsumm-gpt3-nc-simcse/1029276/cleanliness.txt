[0.6217477321624756] The reviews said that the cleanliness of the hotel was fine.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6217477321624756] The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it.
[0.586759090423584] It was very clean.
[0.4800040125846863] Check in was quick and our bags were brought to the room in a timely manner.
[0.4714646339416504] The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
[0.4592205882072449] Also the fitmess center was really excellent.
