[0.5977058410644531] The reviews said that the food was fine if you were a business traveler, but that it was very pricey if you were staying there for holidays.

[0.5977058410644531] Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
[0.5788438320159912] Though I found the hotel very pricey (for us) I'm sure you could get a much better rate on line.
[0.5720641016960144] We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.
[0.5680809020996094] A little bit pricy but you are staying at Hilton, so you expected to pay a bit more.
[0.5617644786834717] Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.
