[0.8021115064620972] Our stay at the Hilton Downtown Miami was nothing short of perfect.
[0.7183619141578674] The Downtown Miami Hilton is on the fringe of the downtown area but very close to the light rail and a short drive to S. Beach and Little Havana.
[0.685599148273468] The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun.
[0.659538984298706] You don't generally go wrong with a Hilton.
[0.6519243121147156] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.1264788657426834] They seem to have no idea how to run a bar.
[-0.06594250351190567] No bar fridge in the room if you want to keep something cold.
[-0.04823972284793854] Plus, they tack on an 18% service fee with the meal - 2 drinks and 2 sandwiches came to $64!!
[-0.028045564889907837] The 2 queen beds were NOT queen size.
[-0.024625342339277267] But not much in walking range.

[0.6235331296920776] The Hotel is good - the location is not.
[0.6125400066375732] The hotel restaurant was adequate; however, the staff here also strived to please.
[0.6093724966049194] Not a terrible place, but I have to say that I've stayed in nicer places that are less expensive.
[0.5974986553192139] The only downfall is that the hotel could have been in a better area.
[0.5599777102470398] But other than that, not a bad place to stay.
