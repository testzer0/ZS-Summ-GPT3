[0.5872029066085815] However, some found the rates to be very high, especially for breakfast, and felt that the hotel was not suitable for a holiday stay.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5872029066085815] Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing.
[0.5469563007354736] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
[0.46524691581726074] As I was only there for one night I didn't utility all the services the hotel had to offer.
[0.45827722549438477] Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all.
