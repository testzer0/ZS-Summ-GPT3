[0.34138739109039307] Overall, the reviews were positive, with people noting the convenient location near the airport and port of Miami.

----- Supporting -----

[0.34138739109039307] The renovations that I have been reading about appear to be just about complete.
[0.3354795575141907] Only negative, which is not fault of Hilton was road construction on Biscayne blvd.
[0.3253124952316284] We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier.
[0.2905348539352417] When we finally got to the lobby (because it's a little bit tricky) it was full of people checking in, but everything ran just perfect thanks to the professionalism and friendly attitude of the front desk agents.
[0.26940417289733887] It is by no means a South Beach property (thankfully).

----- Weakening -----

[-0.002962779253721237] The main lobby was not actually on the second floor - confusing.
[0.04094957560300827] The elevator can take 20-30 minutes to get to your floor and is often filled with people and luggage.
[0.04140632972121239] They are doing the best they can with the old building.
[0.042803652584552765] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
[0.05117477476596832] The elevator dinged all night long keeping up the entire family.

[0.49013620615005493] Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards.
[0.419363409280777] We called the front desk and they sent someone up to check.
[0.3149788975715637] We finally got to the lobby and due to the many marathon guests, it was busy.
[0.253732293844223] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.

[-0.009157581254839897] Also lots of construction on the streets make sure you plan to leave a bit early especially on the weekend.
[0.0025355685502290726] The downtown is a ghost town except for a couple of hotels and Bayside.
[0.008538887836039066] It is by no means a South Beach property (thankfully).
[0.016237370669841766] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
[0.05502409487962723] And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor.

[0.39009222388267517] However, some reviewers found the rates to be expensive, particularly for breakfast, which was not included in the room rate.

[0.3007604777812958] But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking.

[0.07536369562149048] Last night i took it back from Bayside and the car was filled with drunk teens that were looking for a fight.
