[0.575836181640625] The hotel is conveniently located next to the Eaton Centre mall and across the street from the Toronto Convention Centre.

----- Supporting -----

[0.575836181640625] It's a quick ride from the airport, and the bus lets you off at the Metropolitan Hotel about 2 short blocks away.
[0.5655180215835571] The Marriott Eaton Centre provided service at its best.
[0.47248154878616333] Tip - the Toronto Airport Express shuttle bus is a cost-effective mode of transport from the airport to the city.
[0.4692298173904419] However the bus driver pointed out that the U. of Toronto Residence stop (the last stop) was much closer, just a very short walk between some buildings to arrive at the hotel.
[0.4324004054069519] I should note that the Airport Express bus does not list the Marriott as one of its downtown stops, however one of its stops (the Metropolitan Hotel) is only a block or so from the Marriott.
