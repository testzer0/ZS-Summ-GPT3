[0.5763911604881287] Overall, reviewers thought the hotel was well-done, standard for a Marriott, and conveniently located.

[0.5763911604881287] The hotel lobby was very spacious, and well furnished with comfy seating for tired travellers to wait while checking-in.
[0.5400065183639526] The lobby is very appealing and the front desk staff were professional and polite.
[0.532149076461792] The lobby was nicely decorated and the staff were nice.
[0.5232143402099609] Everything was as expected, good check in, great location, nice room, good staff, etc....then about 11:00pm the fire alarms went off.
[0.49738970398902893] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[-0.022983290255069733] We were working on an important project.
[0.0053827716037631035] The subway is about a block away in the basement of the mall.
[0.03259478881955147] Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.
[0.04458820819854736] One small window that didn't open.
[0.06952772289514542] My only advice is to ask for a room opposite the construction side...

[0.5596863031387329] There were issues with the phone system in some rooms not working, but customer service was apologetic and tried to help.

[0.5596863031387329] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
[0.5215659737586975] There was also someone roaming around the lobby to help guests with any questions.
[0.508324384689331] and said that I really needed to do some work on my computer and I asked whether they could not speed up the repair on the line.
[0.4884015917778015] Had some idiot pull fire alarm at 4 am on Sunday, but was resolved within 30 minutes and not having to evacuate.
[0.47643914818763733] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!

[-0.005668371915817261] Its a pretty cool thing to be able to walk right into torontos biggest mall in just two minutes.
[0.050883304327726364] Under that mall is the subway station, so you can actually get on the subway without ever going outside.
[0.11038178205490112] The subway is about a block away in the basement of the mall.
[0.11172559857368469] I spent the better part of a week at this property.
[0.11706149578094482] Kensington Market and the Brewery District were the longest shlepps and those walks might not be for all, but we really enjoyed them and had fun detouring through the nearby neighborhoods.
