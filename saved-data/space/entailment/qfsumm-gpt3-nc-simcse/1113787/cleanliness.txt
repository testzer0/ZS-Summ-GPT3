----- Weakening -----

[0.02522502839565277] The doorman refused to allow us entry and we ended up waiting for almost an hour in the Texas heat while other folks would simply walk off the street and were immediately allowed in!
[0.062298282980918884] My only issue I had with my trip was the Conceirge Katie.
[0.0689278095960617] Bose iPod docs.
[0.07198934257030487] The concierge drove us herself to the symphony when it was apparent that there was a traffic snafu that could render us late.
[0.07908261567354202] Also for the ladies one of Dallas' best spas (Sedona - lady's only) is across the street but make sure and get appointment in advance as my wife couldn't get same day appointment on Saturday.
