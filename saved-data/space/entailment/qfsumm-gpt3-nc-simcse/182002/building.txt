[0.5203441381454468] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[0.4898133873939514] Tim Hortons right in the lobby which was very convenient.
[0.4865207374095917] It appears this hotel also serves as a university residence, but there was no noise issue with that.
[0.41977423429489136] The property was much better then I expected.
[0.41786909103393555] They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting.
