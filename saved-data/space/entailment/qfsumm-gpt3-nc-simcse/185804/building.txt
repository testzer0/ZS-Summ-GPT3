[0.504295289516449] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.469929039478302] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
