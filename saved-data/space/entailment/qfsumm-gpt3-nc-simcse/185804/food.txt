[0.05843720585107803] quiet at night without the often ugly street level scene you encounter at more glamorous high-rises (yes the high-rises can give you great views but coming out at street level you feel like you've walked into a seedy bus station environment).
[0.06491406261920929] If you want to visit downtown just take the water taxi or "aqua bus" these little boats are fun, not very expensive and the quickest way to gt there.
[0.0700077936053276] Water Taxi's and walking paths are right there if you want to head out to English Bay or Yaletown.
[0.08934038132429123] take waterbus for a few dollars and go where you like.
[0.093089759349823] The two water taxis companies serving Granville Island make it very accessible to downtown as well.
