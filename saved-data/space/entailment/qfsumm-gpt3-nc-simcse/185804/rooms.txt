[0.44443029165267944] Some prints on the walls were not to everyone's taste, but the public spaces were nicely decorated.

[0.44443029165267944] I looked at a few different rooms and they vary in size and view.
[0.432949036359787] The rooms were well appointed.
[0.4297841787338257] The rooms are fairly well equipped, and on the surface look good, however the fittings when you look closely at them are not top quality, and will not last.
[0.4249148666858673] The location, the artistic vibe, the fantastic food (the market in our opinion is much better than Pike Place in Seattle that we visited earlier in the week) and this hotel.
[0.39939266443252563] It is a mash up of 80s smoked glass and more recent upgrades and pseudo renovations.

[-0.10586757957935333] My 8 year old could throw a rock into the water from our room but might hit one of the dozens of boats bobbing outside our window.
[-0.07318973541259766] I wish that there were a way to turn off the outside lights, however, so that I could leave the curtains open at night to catch the lights from the buildings across False Creek.
