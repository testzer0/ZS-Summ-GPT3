[0.7089296579360962] This hotel was within a stone's throw of Sea-Tac airport and right next to the off-site Thrifty car rental lot, so for location, it was great.

[-0.07512945681810379] Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water.
[-0.03368989750742912] There was no lake visible.
[-0.013273845426738262] When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that.
[-0.005051938816905022] Confusing layout.
[0.005940635688602924] It takes a few trips to figure it out.

[0.551852822303772] Downtown Seattle was about a 30 minute ride by light rail service (cost of $16 for the 4 of us) or $40 cab ride to the pier.

[0.551852822303772] This was right by the SeaTac Airport, whereby they had a shuttle that would come every 20 mins, and the valet would park the vehicle while we off traveling.
[0.5152440667152405] It is an easy drive into downtown Seattle from here and worked great for my late-arriving flight before meetings in Seattle the following morning.
[0.5072957277297974] The shuttle will drop you at the airport train station if you are going to Seattle, but on your way back you must walk from the station to the shuttle bus pick up area at the airport(about a 5 to 10 minute walk).
[0.4821948707103729] We took the shuttle from the airport, and then back again to pick up our rental car (save the parking fee).
[0.4505416750907898] If you are coming late and/or leaving early at Sea-Tac, this is not a bad choice.

[-0.004413854330778122] Confusing layout.
[0.03647365793585777] It was for a wing room but the reservation staff courteously changed it to a tower room.
[0.03792184963822365] It looks nice on the outside,, but inside it is very shabby and used.
[0.04834373667836189] Use the map the front desk provide and you will have no issues.
[0.05397839844226837] Shame on you Doubletree for charging your own guests to pay to park on your site during their stay.

[0.01493602804839611] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.
[0.02614285796880722] Shame on you Doubletree for charging your own guests to pay to park on your site during their stay.
[0.04929406940937042] What they didn't tell us when booking on the website is that the parking is $16 per night and the internet in the rooms is not wireless.
[0.060292214155197144] At 1am the lobby bar was still very active with a jovial but well-behaved crowd, although the bartenders were understandably ready to head home to their families.
