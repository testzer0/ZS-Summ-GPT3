[0.4939492642879486] The building was clean, the beds were fine, the hotel is located across the street from the airport, within walking distance to a Denny's, Jack in the Box, and a steak place.

[0.4939492642879486] It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.
[0.4832926392555237] The walk from that building to the lobby is about 2-3 minutes.
[0.47344252467155457] I went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and I had what I needed - nice touch.
[0.4535496234893799] Overall this is a good property.
[0.43100664019584656] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.

[0.10857348889112473] This property is a mess.
[0.18878789246082306] Will stay there again in the future.
[0.20377479493618011] One wing building was closed for renovation.
[0.2503388226032257] The exterior of the buildings in these wings looks like some outdated Polynesian tiki architecture.
[0.25411105155944824] The tower elevators, which run on the exterior of the building, were quite cold.

[0.39968395233154297] The gift shop was well stocked and very reasonably priced.
[0.3314894437789917] When we arrived we were told by the front desk the roll-a-way would be sent up immediately and would probably be there before we got up to the room.
[0.32455360889434814] There is an abundance of gardens in between the different buildings and all were very well maintained and tended.
[0.30022382736206055] They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin.

[0.30456310510635376] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
