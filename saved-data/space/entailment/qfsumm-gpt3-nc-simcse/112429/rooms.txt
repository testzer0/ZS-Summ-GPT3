[-0.024364270269870758] There is no pool..the breakfast is in the restaurant and it starts at like $8, you can't put out a little fruit for your guests, the paper is 75 cents a day.
[0.04081866517663002] Ok, it is bad.
[0.04555143043398857] Your only option for room service (aside from breakfast) is overpriced -- tasty, but overpriced -- Asian cuisine from Dragonfish.
