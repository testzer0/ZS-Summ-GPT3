[0.5832124948501587] The location was a little out of the way, but it was only 5 minutes from Disney.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5832124948501587] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....

[0.5678435564041138] I was in Disney World in less than 10 minutes.
[0.5639009475708008] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
[0.5447069406509399] The shuttle service (free) was on time (give or take 10 mins) to the theme parks.
