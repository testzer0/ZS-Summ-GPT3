[0.6974341869354248] The building is fairly new and very clean.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6974341869354248] The place is brand new so everything works just fine.
[0.4413521885871887] The facilities are also better than I have encountered in any hotel.
[0.4314577579498291] Nice lobby with fresh cookies in the evening.
[0.36527684330940247] The lobby is also small.
[0.3511282801628113] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.

[-0.1419873833656311] I did hear them but maybe I just expect that city hum, having grown up in NY.
[-0.14027030766010284] The descriptions of the neighborhood other reviewers made in the past are correct: there are some questionable-looking people, but that is just one of the elements of any big city.
[-0.0738321915268898] I was there the morning of the false fire alarm and although it was annoying I would rather it be false than for real!

[0.2736762762069702] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
