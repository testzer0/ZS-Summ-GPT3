[0.5943522453308105] Overall, reviewers found the service at the hotel to be lacking.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5943522453308105] The Only drawback of this hotel is that usage of Business Center is a bit expensive and so is the Restauant in the hotel for the qulaity of food.
[0.5403421521186829] I would NOT recommend giving this hotel your business.
[0.46196919679641724] All in all, the hotel never bent backwards to compensate for our time involved making calls, getting key made, needing time off work,and driving back.
[0.4604835510253906] As I travel regularly I am accustomed to hotels and the level of service.
[0.4597977101802826] The front desk staff, porters, room staff, wereall excellent....When a hotel strives for excellence in costumer service, it shows....it really does...

[0.5593016743659973] Complaints included no housekeeping/maid service, having to track down a maid to request towels, being given the wrong car when asking for the valet, and being told that their guest could only visit for 10 minutes.

[0.5593016743659973] staff was lovely except the lady who checked me in , wasnt a happy person , she didnt check me in until she make sure that i m a hilton employee , which i m not very happy about .
[0.5520850419998169] Not a bad place for _recreational_ travelers But the desk clerks could not figure out that for business travel, two people might have two reservations to share one room -- not, as the clerks set it up, for one to be the guest of the other (which also means no "HHonors" points for the "guest).
[0.5399175882339478] and that after 10 minutes they were going to come up into our room to check if our guest was still there??!!
[0.5357614755630493] All in all, the hotel never bent backwards to compensate for our time involved making calls, getting key made, needing time off work,and driving back.
[0.5102387070655823] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
