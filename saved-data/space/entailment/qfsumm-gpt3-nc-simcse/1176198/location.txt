[0.023344213142991066] They don't keep change in the restaurant!!!

[0.4528246521949768] The second floor restaurant area was lovely and the service at breakfast could not have been better.
[0.44427356123924255] We really enjoyed our stay here, it is in good location in the Entertainment district, and though we didn't try the restauant or breakfast it looked very good!
[0.44127747416496277] yet the restaurant had the same high quality as the big box Hilton.

[0.002497730776667595] There was an event on at the nightclub one night and I never heard anything.
[0.014267140999436378] Parking is valet only (would prefer the option to self park).
[0.015909627079963684] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!
[0.01823689043521881] They don't keep change in the restaurant!!!
[0.020631738007068634] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.

**********

[0.4599539637565613] They did not like that there was no housekeeping/maid service, and that the kitchen was closed.

----- Supporting -----

[0.4599539637565613] Didn't try the restaurant.
[0.4154021739959717] They don't keep change in the restaurant!!!
[0.4079235792160034] I would avoid the restaurant in the hotel as the service is slow and inconsistent.
[0.3636995851993561] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.3517826199531555] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5101413726806641] There was a slight mix up with our booking but no fuss was made although I did find the reception staff a little disinterested but nothing to spoil my stay.
[0.49955761432647705] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[0.4550800919532776] The Only drawback of this hotel is that usage of Business Center is a bit expensive and so is the Restauant in the hotel for the qulaity of food.
