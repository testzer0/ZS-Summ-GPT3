[0.4789543151855469] Some guests found the continental breakfast to be a joke, with only cereal, toast, and waffles available, and long lines.

----- Supporting -----

[0.4789543151855469] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[0.010009765625] Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative.
[0.008148193359375] We left the next day after a nightmare night and overcrowded non eatable breakfast that you had to stay in line for half an hour.
[0.00530242919921875] I wouldnt even call it a breakfast buffet.. there was toast or some skanky cereal or make your own waffle.. which tasted vile.
[0.0038909912109375] Complimentary breakfast was mediocre, I'd rather go to some nearby restaurant's breakfast buffets for $4++/person.

[-0.9308624267578125] AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!
[-0.9257574081420898] Like some other reviewers have stated, there are a couple of shortcomings...the "Continental Breakfast" is stale bread, lousy toasters, cereal, coffee and orange juice.
[-0.7239751815795898] THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.
[-0.6912422180175781] I'm pretty sure they gave us this hotel so we can compare the 5 star accomadation to this dirty location.
