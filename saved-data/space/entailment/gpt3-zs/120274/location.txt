[0.5124588012695312] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.288787841796875] BUT personally i always stay clear of international drive as i find it quite run down and too busy............if you enjoy the 192 area of kissimee then this hotel is fine!
[0.16915512084960938] It is located on 192 which is close to everything which is nice but I would say to stay somewhere else, somewhere with basic amenities for the same budget price.
[0.04427909851074219] The location is excellent - this end of the 192 is like a miniature (but busier) version of International Drive!!
[0.024404525756835938] Located on a loud busy road frequantly used by the local fire departmentand large lorries, Constant pestering from the ticket stand to sell you a timeshare and tickets.

[-0.8657569885253906] Superb location for Disney with a back road out of the hotel that cuts out all the queues on the 192.
[-0.8324480056762695] We were on the 3rd floor backside of hotel therefore no noise from above and very little walking by or from road.
[-0.6804656982421875] the hotel is on the main strip but once you close your door you dont hear any noise from traffic etc .
[-0.2213897705078125] The hotel is not very hard to find.
