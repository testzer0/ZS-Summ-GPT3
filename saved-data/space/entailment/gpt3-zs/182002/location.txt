[0.7070636749267578] The reviews said that the location was good, with some mentioning that it was close to restaurants and attractions.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7070636749267578] First impression, it was in a decent area, not too far from the central part of downtown with all the restaurants and I thought ok, not too bad.
[0.5350990295410156] It is in a great location and was able to walk to some great restaurants and shopping places.
[0.4235115051269531] surrounded by great restauants and a healthy walking distance to shops, Air Canada Centre, CN Tower.
[0.3280525207519531] The location is good being a short walk into town and is close to the new Loblaws food emporium at Maple Leaf Gardens.
[0.233642578125] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).

[-0.4582977294921875] When at the restaurant, they gave me catchup that was so rancid it bubbled.
[-0.40645408630371094] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.

----- Supporting -----

[0.0579071044921875] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.0017566680908203125] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.

[0.0011806488037109375] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.

[0.9875094890594482] The hotel is in a nice location, within walking distance of everything touristy.
[0.983057975769043] The hotel is situated in a good area and walking distance to Eaton Centre and many other attractions.

[0.9344348907470703] The Hotel is in walking distance to most major attractions and the public transportation is easily accessible.
[0.6421470642089844] The place was in a good location and I was able to walk to a huge mall and what I guess is Torontoâ€™s equivalent of Times Square.

[-0.9575138092041016] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.
[-0.803135871887207] Heed this warning stay away from this crappy place, you'll be glad you did.
[-0.6962661743164062] The rest of the area I would not trust to walk alone at night and there is not a great deal to do other than take a taxi west where the true city begins.
[-0.66156005859375] The underground parking is horribly laid out.
[-0.5945281982421875] Only good thing was that it was a few blocks from the subway.

[0.15062713623046875] It is also close to Massey Hall for concert-goers.

[0.15062713623046875] We were there for a Chicago concert at Massey Hall and it was about a ten minute walk.
[0.0014142990112304688] All in all, a great place to go for some fun times in Toronto!
[0.0010824203491210938] The location is great.

[-0.10692787170410156] I would not reccomend this place to even my worst ennemies.
[-0.06643295288085938] THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.
[-0.061580657958984375] Shame they couldn't have arranged the weather!!
[-0.046657562255859375] I did ask if I just could use maybe a land line but no luck.

[0.851226806640625] The only downside is the cost of parking, which at $23 a day, is expensive compared to other cities.

----- Supporting -----

[0.851226806640625] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.0813140869140625] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[-0.0012006759643554688] Was a nice place.
[-0.0015187263488769531] Great location, close to CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Yonge Street, Hockey Hall of Fame.
[-0.0020759105682373047] First impression, it was in a decent area, not too far from the central part of downtown with all the restaurants and I thought ok, not too bad.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8485488891601562] The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out.
[-0.5776824951171875] The only gripe I had really, was that the bar shut very early & we couldn`t get a beer when we returned after our night on the town.
[-0.541412353515625] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[-0.5081090927124023] Heed this warning stay away from this crappy place, you'll be glad you did.
[-0.4633054733276367] The best thing about the room was its view.
