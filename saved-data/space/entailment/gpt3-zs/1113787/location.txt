[0.019603729248046875] There is a Neiman Marcus and a decent Mexican restaurant next door, but there's also a boarded up building.
[0.0126495361328125] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[0.0008449554443359375] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[-0.0001373291015625] We began the evening in the hotel room, then walked a short distance to a nearby resturant for dinner.
[-0.0019783973693847656] Had we been paying attention though, we could have asked for a room on the back side of the hotel when we made our reservation.

[0.8833198547363281] Charlie Palmer's is a great hotel restaurant.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8833198547363281] We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel restaurant Charlie Palmers and it was excellent.
[0.7108955383300781] It is clear this hotel has no loading dock or alley because while I was eating dinner at the award winning restaurant downstairs (Charlie Palmer's) I had big trucks pulling up within 10 ft of my table loading and unloading big crates of towels (I learned they outsource their linens) and other large pieces of equipment.
[0.6726207733154297] The reception was held in the beautiful Radiiant Salon room and catered by Charlie Palmer's, the hotel's famous restaurant.
[0.34377479553222656] Charlie Palmers is a wonderful restaurant and also supplys room service.
[0.0941162109375] ok Saturday we ate at Charlie Palmers resturant in hotel food was good but service was so bad I could get better service at MC Donalds than this supper bad.

[-0.8521728515625] It was more like a nightclub than a Lounge.
[-0.7734298706054688] Check out Iron Cactus for a drink - they have 3rd story rooftop bar that is really nice if weather is good.
[-0.7116317749023438] Their nightclub, PM, manages the pool area.
[-0.5629634857177734] There is a Neiman Marcus and a decent Mexican restaurant next door, but there's also a boarded up building.
[-0.45520973205566406] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.

[-0.00057220458984375] The staff at the hotel and the parking company (ACE parking) are working hard to rectify the situation, but at $27/night for parking one would hope that her car was more secure than it apparently was.
