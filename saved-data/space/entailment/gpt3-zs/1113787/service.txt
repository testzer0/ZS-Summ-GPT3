[0.1608867645263672] The staff for the cars, porters and in the pool bar were all friendly and helpful.
[0.12087631225585938] Then I went up to bar to close tab again just standing there it took ten mins, then the manager of the pool and club pm was there and was very friendly offered us free drinks and help but I rejected I no longer wanted to be around that.
[0.1181640625] Furthermore, room service was closed at 10 pm, front desk was unhelpful (in ordering a pizza nonetheless) and Charlie Palmer was a waste of time and energy (great staff, HORRIBLE management.)
