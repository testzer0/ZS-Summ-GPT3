[0.159912109375] The building is nicely decorated, but the rooms are old and in need of renovation.

[0.159912109375] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.04290008544921875] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[0.0083160400390625] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[-0.0018739700317382812] You do have a art institute across the road.
[-0.0048980712890625] *The art in the rooms are old and are of Delta, why not GI?

[-0.016547203063964844] The staff is friendly, but the elevator is scary and the pay-per-view movie didn't work.

[-0.13322830200195312] I'd have given it 5 stars if only the desk chair hadn't had arms and been a royal pain to move around.
