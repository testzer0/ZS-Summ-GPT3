[0.014892578125] Concierge lounge nibbles in the evening were a little disappointing, but the staff were friendly (I think this area used to be the old steak house).
[0.00566864013671875] When my husband's Cesar salad was served with chicken instead of salmon, he had to hunt down the waiter to point out the problem, and the waiter barely seemed to care.
[-0.0016107559204101562] We didn't eat at the steak bar though.
[-0.002964019775390625] I can't comment on the food or drinks offered at the hotel as we did not order anything at the restaurant or room service - it was pretty expensive.
[-0.0031557083129882812] It think it may also be the most expensive of all of the Toronto Marriott hotels.

[0.001323699951171875] Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.
