[0.24115371704101562] The reviews said that the hotel is clean, but there are some dust bunnies.

----- Supporting -----

[0.24115371704101562] The rooms were clean, but when you looked closely, you would feel it needed a deep clean.. Ie around baseboards, walls and ceiling in bath, etc.
[-0.0011920928955078125] This hotel has a slow parking garage elevator and forces you to call housekeeping if you want your bedding changed.
[-0.00232696533203125] Obviously this hotel very rarely shampoos the carpets.
[-0.0024242401123046875] I chose not to pay for a concierge level room since the concierge lounge was closed most of the weekend.
[-0.0024251937866210938] Stayed from August 3rd to 5th with two friends for Caribana Weekend; booked on Expedia at the last minute so I was a bit worried, but the price was fair, so I figured I'd take what I got.
