[0.329132080078125] The room was not clean when the reviewer arrived, and housekeeping did not come by until later in the day.

----- Supporting -----

[0.329132080078125] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.
[0.1707763671875] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.0257568359375] It was rush hour, so the concierge had to stand out there quite a while to catch one that was empty.
[-0.00043964385986328125] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[-0.0020389556884765625] It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.

[0.0042858123779296875] It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.
[-0.00122833251953125] The only aspect of the hotel that could be improved, in my opinion, is the fitness center -- it's in the basement and has older equipment.
[-0.0012769699096679688] My companion and I stayed at this hotel because it was one of the most affordable on the day we went.
[-0.0021343231201171875] I ended up with a very early morning arrival flight, and hoped that the hotel would hold my bags until check in since I had a meeting at 11am... they let me check into my room at 9:30am!

[-0.15488052368164062] They use energy saving compact flourescent bulbs so the room was not very bright for reading.
[-0.10430908203125] Not counting the missing kettle!
[-0.09902572631835938] I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.
