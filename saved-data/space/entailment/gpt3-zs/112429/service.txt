----- Supporting -----

[0.7963104248046875] The staff is friendly and super helpful (ie: tourist questions, room questions etc), the rooms are neat and clean and comfortable, the location is perfect and close to everything you need downtown including transit to anything outside of downtown (monorail, bus stops, lightrail).
[0.7661018371582031] The staff was friendly, helpful, and prompt, and the hotel's restaurant is good.
[0.7266693115234375] The staff were helpful and friendly, and the services fine, although I was disappointed they have no gift shop to buy a magazine or other small items.
[0.6452083587646484] The staff is gracious and welcoming, responds to requests and questions in a helpful manner, and seem to genuinely care that you enjoy your stay in their hotel and your visit to the city.
[0.5386505126953125] The room service order-taker and delivery person were both very nice and professional, but it would be wonderful to have a wider range of menu options to select from.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9967665672302246] Staff was rude and impatient.
[-0.993675708770752] He was very rude and would not let me use the phone to call other hotels for vacancies.
[-0.9914331436157227] But I thought the staff were unprofessional and I was uncomfortable with the men at the desk.
[-0.990516185760498] The baggage staff was very slow and had no sense of urgency to help us with our bags.
[-0.9830102920532227] The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit.
