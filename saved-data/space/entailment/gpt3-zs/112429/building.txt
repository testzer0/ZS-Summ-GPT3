[0.9917080402374268] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.
[0.19083023071289062] the lobby is sort of lackluster but the rooms were tasfully updated and very clean.
[0.02330780029296875] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[0.020949363708496094] The hotel was under exterior renovations, but that worked out for me as I was out of my room for most of the day.
[0.0034532546997070312] The lobby of the hotel is quite small, but well-appointed.
