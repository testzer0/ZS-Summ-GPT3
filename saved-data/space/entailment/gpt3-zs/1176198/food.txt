[0.062061309814453125] Fresh fruit and fruit juices, breads and pastries, and coffee brought to the table rather than stewed out of a communal urn.

[-0.05999755859375] I really don't have anything bad to say about this hotel, the price is a little steep per night but it is definitely worth it.
[-0.0168304443359375] The only thing i would not recommend is eating at the hotel; with as many restaurants nearby, go out.
[-0.013885498046875] My only complaint was that there were only two tiny creamers but enough coffee to make 4 cups.
[-0.0015106201171875] It would be great to see more cream in the room in future.
[-0.0006561279296875] So you can pack a couple of apples or muffins for later in the day and save yourself some more money on food!
