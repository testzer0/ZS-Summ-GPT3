[0.8167037963867188] Some reviewers found the location noisy due to the proximity to the entertainment district.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8167037963867188] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.70343017578125] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
[0.66326904296875] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.22467041015625] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.02608489990234375] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.24169921875] The hotel is close enough to the big attractions to be convenient but still is not in an overly busy/loud part of town which was nice.
[-0.12029266357421875] Not near a subway, but no need, we walked everywhere.
[-0.0876922607421875] Shopping district for shoppers out there.
[-0.07635498046875] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[-0.06978607177734375] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!

[0.6151580810546875] Parking was noted as being convenient, although valet-only.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6151580810546875] The hotel has Valet parking only which is fine since you can walk to everything.
[0.0901947021484375] I think the valet parking at the hotel is around the same amount and you can take your car in and out as needed.
[0.076873779296875] Some caveats: The valet parking [only option] is $35 CAD.
[0.0151519775390625] We enjoyed a buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant on Sunday morning and then we called the valet parking to get our cars (two cars for the 8 of us).
[-0.0015869140625] Parking is valet only (would prefer the option to self park).

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9661455154418945] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
[-0.9085693359375] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[-0.8402633666992188] Another thing is try to avoid the public parking across the hotel.
[-0.7981414794921875] You can self-park but being right downtown I figured it wasn't worth the hassle to save a few bucks.
[-0.7785491943359375] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.

[0.43601036071777344] We could walk to the CN Tower and Skydome as well as many restaurants, and the customers we were calling on were close by, so the location in Toronto was great for us.
[0.4342765808105469] Great location and a short walk to much of Toronto's sights.
[0.25695037841796875] It is in a great location and in walking distance to all the entertainment in downtown Toronto!
[0.2041034698486328] Good location, walking distance to all major attractions in Toronto.
