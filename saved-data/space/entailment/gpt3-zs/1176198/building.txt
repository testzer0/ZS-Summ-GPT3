[-0.5277795791625977] Never again will I waste money at this property.
[-0.4716329574584961] There were weird grease marks on the wall as well.
[-0.3665199279785156] I was there the morning of the false fire alarm and although it was annoying I would rather it be false than for real!

[-0.00209808349609375] The descriptions of the neighborhood other reviewers made in the past are correct: there are some questionable-looking people, but that is just one of the elements of any big city.
[-0.0023632049560546875] Definately recommend the property.
[-0.00286865234375] I did hear them but maybe I just expect that city hum, having grown up in NY.
[-0.00339508056640625] (once we figured out how to work all the shower heads) The walls were very thin though-we could really hear our neighbours mini party at 2AM in the morning.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8286933898925781] The only bad things that i can mention are that during my stay another guest decided to set the fire alarm of at 04:30, not a wake up call I want to repeat.
