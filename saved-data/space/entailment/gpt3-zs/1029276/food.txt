[0.1707763671875] The food at the hotel was rated as being excellent, great, very good, good, decent, and mediocre.

----- Supporting -----

[0.1707763671875] Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
[-0.01371002197265625] Also a salad place and sandwich shop just past 19th St (hotel is on 16th).
[-0.01479339599609375] Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.
[-0.018909454345703125] I could have spent less in the end and stayed somewhere else.
[-0.020824432373046875] The drinks and food are pricey in the hotel, but then again in Miami everything seems to be expensive.
