[0.1406707763671875] The hotel could do with a refurbishment, and there is construction happening on the exterior and in the lobby.

[0.1406707763671875] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
[0.055385589599609375] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.014825820922851562] And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor.
[0.0041656494140625] Also lots of construction on the streets make sure you plan to leave a bit early especially on the weekend.

[-0.2073974609375] Only negative, which is not fault of Hilton was road construction on Biscayne blvd.
[-0.20449542999267578] Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards.
[-0.20279788970947266] When we finally got to the lobby (because it's a little bit tricky) it was full of people checking in, but everything ran just perfect thanks to the professionalism and friendly attitude of the front desk agents.
[-0.16547012329101562] A design genius put this hotel together clearly.

[-0.1428365707397461] We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier.
[-0.08934783935546875] Beautiful lobby!
