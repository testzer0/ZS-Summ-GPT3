[0.01092529296875] Some fun decor and some oldish.
[-0.003926277160644531] I had great difficulty getting a room in Miami as it was Super Bowl week end and so used some HHonors points to stay here.
[-0.00574493408203125] They did charge for wifi however, which seems unnecessary.
[-0.006252288818359375] The toaster was broken as well, with burned out elements.
[-0.0070400238037109375] Check-in was easy, though its a little funky getting to the reception area as you have to take an elevator up a floor, but not a big deal.

[0.475250244140625] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.000263214111328125] Just based on prior experience I thought that the next morning we would be scrambling for cabs so I got downstairs a little early.
[-4.1961669921875e-05] I would hope that there would be a cerfew and expectations of adult supervision in the future as I got little sleep as a result of the noise.
[-0.0004405975341796875] Room was very sub-standard for cleanliness...floor looked like it never gets vacuumed.
[-0.0006437301635742188] 4 persons stayed in room but only towels for 3 people.

[0.0189208984375] The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it.
[0.00339508056640625] One or two issues during our stay included :- Housekeeping - at least 2 days out of the 5 our room was not made up and we had to chase housekeeping.
[0.00130462646484375] The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
