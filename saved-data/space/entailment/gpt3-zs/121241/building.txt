[0.20084381103515625] There were dead bugs floating in the water, a hole in the wall under the window, a piece of wood holding a slide glass door open, chains on other doors that said "this entrance is in need of repairs, sorry for any inconvenience" or something to that affect.
[0.057094573974609375] We would never go back to this property again, because of the condition of the property, and the bad oders.
[-0.000244140625] However, when we went into the building....the musty odor was horrible, the lobby area was humid as if the air conditioning wasn't on, the elevator smelled musty.
