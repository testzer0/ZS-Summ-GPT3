[0.9677741527557373] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
[0.04707527160644531] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
[0.023729324340820312] They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin.
