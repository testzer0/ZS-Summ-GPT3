[0.6376495361328125] Bathroom floors seems dirty and needed to be regrouted.

[0.3061676025390625] Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.
[0.24963760375976562] The bathrooms are worn and need updating.
[0.20041656494140625] But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected.

[0.004241943359375] Other than that issue, the hotel is nice and staff was great.
[0.000720977783203125] Had a room that faced away from the airport so that helped with the noise.
[0.0004177093505859375] Decided to stay one night by the airport and used priceline to get a room and ended up with the doubletree at a good rate!
