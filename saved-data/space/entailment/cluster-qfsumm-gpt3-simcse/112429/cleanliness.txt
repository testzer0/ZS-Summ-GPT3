[0.5656831860542297] Great pricing compared to other hotels near by.
[0.5112321972846985] I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.
[0.489788293838501] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
[0.4882528781890869] The only aspect of the hotel that could be improved, in my opinion, is the fitness center -- it's in the basement and has older equipment.
[0.4610411524772644] My companion and I stayed at this hotel because it was one of the most affordable on the day we went.

[0.5950063467025757] Some guests also found the rooms to be unsanitary.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5950063467025757] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.4927234649658203] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
[0.4621425271034241] Not to mention when I checked in they yelled my room number out to me, not a good idea as a female travelling alone...
[0.45763054490089417] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[0.4424888491630554] The A/C, no matter how low it was set, didn't keep the room very cool.
