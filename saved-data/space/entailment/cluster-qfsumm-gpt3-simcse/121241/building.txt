[0.751634955406189] The building was in poor condition, with dead bugs in the water, a hole in the wall, and chains on the doors.

[0.751634955406189] There were dead bugs floating in the water, a hole in the wall under the window, a piece of wood holding a slide glass door open, chains on other doors that said "this entrance is in need of repairs, sorry for any inconvenience" or something to that affect.
[0.574727475643158] However, when we went into the building....the musty odor was horrible, the lobby area was humid as if the air conditioning wasn't on, the elevator smelled musty.
[0.5743740797042847] The exterior doors had problems locking.
[0.4661955237388611] The door could hardly clear the toilet.
[0.4468351900577545] All 3 bldgs are old and need to be updated.. not with paint either...i mean gutted & refinished completely.
