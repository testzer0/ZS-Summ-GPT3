[0.726996660232544] They also said that parking was an issue and that the nightclub next door could be loud.

[0.726996660232544] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.6768196821212769] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.
[0.6608632802963257] With regards to the nightclub next door.
[0.6403850317001343] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.
[0.5960983037948608] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
