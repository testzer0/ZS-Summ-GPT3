[0.6489025354385376] However, some guests have complained about thin walls, a small and crowded lobby, and a false fire alarm.

[0.6489025354385376] The only bad things that i can mention are that during my stay another guest decided to set the fire alarm of at 04:30, not a wake up call I want to repeat.
[0.5415053367614746] The lobby is also small.
[0.4372286796569824] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[0.4320405125617981] The fire alarm went off in the ENTIRE hotel very early in the morning because someone burned toast.
[0.4306721091270447] Lobby was a little small and at times quite crowded, but once you pass through that it was a non-issue.
