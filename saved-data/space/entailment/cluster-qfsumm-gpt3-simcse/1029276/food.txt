[0.5216419696807861] The food at the restaurant was excellent and the service was great.
[0.5006611347198486] Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.
[0.47547653317451477] The hotel is very clean, the staff professional - and the food - simply amazing.
[0.4721394181251526] There was one occasion in which we ordered from the menu, sadly it was a little disappointing because it was overcooked but we were taken care of almost immediately when we complained.
