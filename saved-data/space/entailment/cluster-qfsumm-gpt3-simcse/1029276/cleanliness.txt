[0.742895781993866] One or two issues during our stay included :- Housekeeping - at least 2 days out of the 5 our room was not made up and we had to chase housekeeping.
[0.6823559403419495] They also did an extremely lousy job in cleaning the room.
[0.6465297341346741] Room was very sub-standard for cleanliness...floor looked like it never gets vacuumed.
[0.6203659176826477] The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
[0.5532113313674927] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.

[0.5475419163703918] The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it.
