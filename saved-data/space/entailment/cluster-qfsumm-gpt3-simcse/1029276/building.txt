[0.6672966480255127] The hotel is undergoing construction and renovation, which can be disruptive and inconvenient for guests.

[0.6672966480255127] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
[0.6632907390594482] Hotel could do with a refurbishment.
[0.5985764861106873] Construction was happening on the exterior of the hotel.
[0.49806398153305054] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.4469657838344574] And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor.

[0.09464042633771896] Last night i took it back from Bayside and the car was filled with drunk teens that were looking for a fight.
[0.1644955277442932] We called the front desk and they sent someone up to check.
[0.17489443719387054] It is by no means a South Beach property (thankfully).
[0.2134292721748352] We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier.
[0.23103243112564087] When we finally got to the lobby (because it's a little bit tricky) it was full of people checking in, but everything ran just perfect thanks to the professionalism and friendly attitude of the front desk agents.

[0.7897480726242065] The lobby is in a strange location and is not very inviting.

[0.7021900415420532] The main lobby was not actually on the second floor - confusing.
[0.6409532427787781] But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking.
[0.5815786123275757] Beautiful lobby!
[0.5429637432098389] Ä±t has an interesting entrance you take a lift to 3 floor above to enter the lobby from the valet service but still not tiring.
