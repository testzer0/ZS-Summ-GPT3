[0.790527880191803] However the best bit of this hotel is by far the location, just 2 mile from Disney and surrounded by quality restaurants and shops, you can not go wrong.

[-0.04219895228743553] with a couple of tables and chairs.. you had to fight to get a seat..
[-0.030806520953774452] It wasn't a problem though, and I didn't even report it to reception.
[-0.01213616132736206] I went down to get some ice and found I needed to return to the room to obtain a quarter... ice was not free.
[0.01855641044676304] The one thing I was a bit 'meh' about; you have to pay for ice.

[0.6554796695709229] However, some reviewers mention that the hotel is difficult to get to without a car.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6554796695709229] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.5929200053215027] The hotel is not very hard to find.
[0.5534631013870239] BUT personally i always stay clear of international drive as i find it quite run down and too busy............if you enjoy the 192 area of kissimee then this hotel is fine!
[0.5471577644348145] I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.
[0.5434635877609253] The only okay thing about the hotel was the location.
