[0.7235164046287537] Hotel does supply free shuttle buses to all theme parks which go every day and you don't have to bye your tickets from the guest services at the front of the hotel happy holidays.
[0.6784532070159912] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.

[0.6223081946372986] However, some reviewers found the shuttle service to be slow and only running to certain parks.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6223081946372986] There is also free shuttle buses to the parks but can get full as they pick up from several places.
[0.6150159239768982] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
[0.6093096733093262] From previous experience from other hotels they usually only have limited pick ups for the parks.
[0.5825722217559814] We didn't have a car so it worked with the shuttle to the parks (although it took a really long time!)
[0.5695537328720093] CAR NEEDED, although there is a free shuttle to some parks.
