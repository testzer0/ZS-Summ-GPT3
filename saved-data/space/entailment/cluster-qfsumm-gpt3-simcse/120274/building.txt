[0.6070693135261536] Overall, reviewers thought the hotel was comfortable, although some furniture was a bit old.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6070693135261536] Ok so the furniture was a bit tired but stuff worked, plenty of hot water and there was a microwave and fridge in the room.
[0.5498777627944946] The furniture, i.e tv unit and clothes drawers seemed to be the only thing that seemed a little tired, but not so much that you would notice.
[0.48923903703689575] I would certainly reccomend this property to anyone who desires a comfortable "sleeper" at a great price
[0.41133853793144226] The person at the front desk met all are requests... a quiet room away from the traffic.
[0.3557876646518707] Hotel shop is very expensive so be warned.

[-0.06462748348712921] A must is a car because travelling around on foot is hard the roads are really hard to cross you take your life into your own hands and wait up to 15 mins for the lights to change and watch the traffic from the right because while your crossing they are too.
