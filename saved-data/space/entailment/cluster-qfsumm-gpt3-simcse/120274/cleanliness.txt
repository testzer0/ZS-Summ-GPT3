[0.5162097811698914] However if the slightest sign of dirt or grime gives you cause to reach for the phone and call reception, I would pass on this hotel for 2 reasons.
[0.5036450028419495] First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.

[0.4953998923301697] The beds & towels were clean & as we were only there for a week & hardly spending any time in the hotel then we just put up with it.
[0.4903821349143982] Now for the negatives again keeping in mind we were able secure a great price for our stay so negatives are very few in our minds Wi-fi does not go much further than the lobby we already knew this from prior reviews and it really didn't matter.
