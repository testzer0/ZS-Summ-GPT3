[-0.022209681570529938] Few hours went by, and still no cots, and the four year old was getting tired.
[-0.018759964033961296] There is no wifi in the rooms, only the lobby.
[0.03256215900182724] Excellent steakhouse two blocks away...easy to walk to...called Barberians...very expensive!

[0.048950955271720886] Because of the adjoining door and no soundproofing between these rooms, I could hear their group conversations as if they were sitting next to me.
