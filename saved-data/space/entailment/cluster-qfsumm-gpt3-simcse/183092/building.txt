[0.009041806682944298] Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.
[0.05164762958884239] One small window that didn't open.
[0.060469210147857666] We were working on an important project.
[0.07241740077733994] One guest's inconsiderate action should not reflect upon the property.
[0.08175148069858551] My only advice is to ask for a room opposite the construction side...

[0.6646656394004822] However, some thought it was in need of refurbishment, particularly in the older rooms.

[0.6646656394004822] Think it's in real need of refurbishment.
[0.63267982006073] The lobby refurb looked great -- now they just need to tackle some of the older rooms.
[0.5575498938560486] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[0.07631441205739975] Its a pretty cool thing to be able to walk right into torontos biggest mall in just two minutes.
[0.09438659250736237] Under that mall is the subway station, so you can actually get on the subway without ever going outside.
[0.09928692877292633] From the moment we walked in the door we felt welcomed and comfortable.

[0.10814882069826126] Bonus, no need to go out with a coat since the Marriott has indoor access to the Eaton Center...Shoppers Heaven for sure!!!

[0.671953558921814] There were some complaints about the fire alarm going off, but staff were generally praised for their handling of the situation.

----- Supporting -----

[0.671953558921814] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!
[0.6411075592041016] Had some idiot pull fire alarm at 4 am on Sunday, but was resolved within 30 minutes and not having to evacuate.
[0.6102515459060669] Everything was as expected, good check in, great location, nice room, good staff, etc....then about 11:00pm the fire alarms went off.
[0.5611615180969238] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
[0.5507568120956421] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.

[0.023297101259231567] The subway is about a block away in the basement of the mall.
[0.053422559052705765] Of course, when you arrive at the mall, you're in the ladies lingerie dept.

[0.5840166211128235] The location was also praised, with the subway station being close by.

[0.39841338992118835] Kensington Market and the Brewery District were the longest shlepps and those walks might not be for all, but we really enjoyed them and had fun detouring through the nearby neighborhoods.
