[0.7601432800292969] However, some guests had issues with the phone system in their rooms not working, and cots not being delivered in a timely manner.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7601432800292969] The issue I had is that the phone system in some of the rooms was not functioning when I checked in.
[0.6601741909980774] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[0.5999316573143005] They were slow to arrive at the lobby on Saturday afternoon, evening and the next morning.

[0.7632673978805542] The hotel's internet connection was also criticized as being pricey.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7632673978805542] One is my usual complaint of charging the exhorbitant fees for internet access in the guest rooms...this drives me crazy that I can go to a Holiday Inn Express and get free wireless internet in my room but the higher end hotels charge for it.
[0.6807933449745178] And what is it with hotels charging more than $300 a night and still nickle and diming you with a daily internet charge?
[0.6681603193283081] Internet connection in room rather pricey.
[0.5425105094909668] I was disappointed with the Internet service, though: $15 + $3 service charge daily, from noon to noon, with some interruptions.
[0.5194283723831177] For business use the hotel gets a C, it was a poor service compared to the others.

[-0.003877885639667511] Every interaction I had with the staff was perfect.
[-0.0025863628834486008] The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all".
[0.004250967875123024] Great service is offered without the expectation of a gratuity.
