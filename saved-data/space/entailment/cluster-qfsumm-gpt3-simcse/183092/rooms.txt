[-0.07966654002666473] It means breakfast on the last day is either cash of charge card.
[-0.040549926459789276] Then hard to get out as Mcguinty crew in town and elevators shut down once again.
[0.0003469516523182392] The pool didn't have a shallow end for small children, so if you have a younger child you have to hold them the whole time.
[0.0027486803010106087] While we didnâ€™t get the free breakfast others have mentioned, we ended up at a tiny place across the street called The Daily Brew.
[0.009399996139109135] It's amazing how not being able to have a normal shower can affect my overall impression but it does.

[0.553062379360199] However, some reviewers noted that the rooms facing the office building did not have much privacy.

----- Supporting -----

[0.553062379360199] My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.
[0.5463167428970337] The rest of the hotel was nice but a little dated.
[0.5377947092056274] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.
[0.5280389785766602] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.
[0.4921623170375824] Also a lot of the rooms face an office building, so theres not much privacy, because the curtains are very easily seen through, but overall if your willing to pay over 250 a night, your really only paying for the location and the walkway to the mall.
