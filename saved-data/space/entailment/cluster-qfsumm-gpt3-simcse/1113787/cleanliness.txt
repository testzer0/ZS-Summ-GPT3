[0.5816205739974976] Everything was clean and well maintained.
[0.5750836133956909] So overall I would recommend the hotel but just double check EVERYTHING on your invoice.
[0.549380898475647] There are a lot of pluses - the feel, the location, the pool, Charlie Palmer, the service, the workout facilities.
[0.5323657393455505] The decor is unique and the room layouts take a little getting used to, but I would highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.
[0.530458927154541] Other than that no complaints, beautiful pool on the 10th floor and up to date fitness center with bottles of water and fruit.

[0.032789066433906555] The doorman refused to allow us entry and we ended up waiting for almost an hour in the Texas heat while other folks would simply walk off the street and were immediately allowed in!
[0.0428876057267189] Bose iPod docs.
[0.06358562409877777] Also for the ladies one of Dallas' best spas (Sedona - lady's only) is across the street but make sure and get appointment in advance as my wife couldn't get same day appointment on Saturday.
[0.06479734182357788] My only issue I had with my trip was the Conceirge Katie.
[0.06688371300697327] The concierge drove us herself to the symphony when it was apparent that there was a traffic snafu that could render us late.

[0.7409184575080872] However, one reviewer said that the maids need to dust the bathroom lights, and another said that the carpet was damp when they arrived.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7409184575080872] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[0.5246508121490479] I do think it is a lovely hotel but I would like to mention the lighting in the rooms was terrible.
[0.45707830786705017] I had a rather loud banging on my door to find a maid who said (Who spoke little english) 'downturn you have ice".
[0.40569090843200684] High quality toiletries.
[0.3926808834075928] This was part of the Starwood Luxury Collection, but having been dissappointed many times before, I did not expect much.

[0.009065434336662292] I know that from Jennifer that checked us in with her welcoming smile we would have a good time.
[0.04433933645486832] I absolutely adored them both... Will def return!!!
[0.04545680433511734] 2) Visit the Poule at the Joule - Make sure to ask for Todd or Stephen & make sure to swim to the edge and overlook the city.
[0.059302739799022675] It was EXACTLY what we both needed, to relax and just enjoy ourselves fully without any stress.
[0.06871200352907181] The chef generously shared the granola recipe with my husband, who declared it the best granola he'd even eaten.
