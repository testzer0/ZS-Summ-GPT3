[0.48340341448783875] Although the room we were in was a bit small, they had really nice decor and details that you would not see a Marriott or a Hilton, IMHO.
[0.4755270481109619] The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars (if I could it would be 4.75) on "Service" is b/c they weren't so timely on pre-arranged room service...we asked for it by a certain time and it arrived about a half hour later.
[0.46565043926239014] Afterwards you can write your own review on this intimate and polished hotel.

[0.5334296822547913] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.
[0.4826158285140991] The photos were interesting, the bathrooms unique, and the bed was really comfortable.
