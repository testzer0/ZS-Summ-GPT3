[0.44729626178741455] There is a Neiman Marcus and a decent Mexican restaurant next door, but there's also a boarded up building.
[0.4289088249206543] This hotel has a very cramped feel.
[0.4200843572616577] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.3920111656188965] parking is a bit expensive but what do you expect in downtown... we did find a parking garage a couple of blocks on elm street.
[0.38282647728919983] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
