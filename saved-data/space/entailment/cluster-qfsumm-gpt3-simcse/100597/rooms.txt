[0.7561023235321045] The wing hallways had a damp smell.
[0.6467896699905396] The room was like staying in a basement, an old and mildew smell.
[0.6238400936126709] It's obviously clean, although the further you get into the maze of halls the more the funky smell of "old" permeates the air.
[0.5552507042884827] Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.
[0.5468437671661377] There was mildew in the bathroom-cleanliness was fair.
