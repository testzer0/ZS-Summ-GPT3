[0.6522554159164429] The hotel has unique architecture and is located near the airport.

[0.6522554159164429] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
[0.5390244722366333] It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.
[0.4537595212459564] I was put into this property by an airline due to a maintenance issue, although I checked in late at night and had to leave early the next morning, I saw enough that I want to return!
[0.4296533465385437] Access to the tower is by external glass elevators.
[0.4053284227848053] The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms.

[0.12114033848047256] The gift shop was well stocked and very reasonably priced.
[0.12248052656650543] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
[0.15493382513523102] This property is a mess.
[0.1587010771036148] They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin.
