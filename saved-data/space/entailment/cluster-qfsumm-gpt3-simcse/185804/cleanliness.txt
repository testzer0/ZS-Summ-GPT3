[0.4337252378463745] What would have made this hotel a 5-star for us would have been if the concierge had been more knowledgeable, particularly with transit options for exploring attractions.
[0.42456766963005066] Check-in was friendly and efficient, and our room, although small, was fine.
[0.40141820907592773] It is clean, just a little frumpy.
[0.39426127076148987] What can we say, with the great location, ambiance and first class staff , who met our every need.

[0.6427180767059326] * Lamp had burnt out light bulb...not a big deal but these things should be checked upon cleaning.
[0.5888839960098267] And the most annoying: the room lighting is poor, in particular the reading light.
[0.5226425528526306] My husband tried removing the shade from the lamp, which only helped a tiny bit.
[0.44657760858535767] *The shampoo was in a ridiculous size bottle and if anyone figures out how to get it out of the bottle I would love to know.
