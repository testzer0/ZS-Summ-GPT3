[0.617935061454773] It is obvious that Customer Service is not a priority for this hotel.
[0.5860874652862549] The staff were rude and quite useless, they just seemed annoyed and unwilling to help no matter how polite we were.
[0.5587987303733826] My experience at this hotel was the worst I've ever experience within the service industry.
[0.5508460998535156] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.5442665219306946] Looks very disgruntled employees they have got.

[0.03084753081202507] You'll get on for a couple minutes and then it will flake out and you'll spend the next 10 minutes trying to reconnect.
[0.037295546382665634] The wireless Internet, while free, is not even worth that price.
