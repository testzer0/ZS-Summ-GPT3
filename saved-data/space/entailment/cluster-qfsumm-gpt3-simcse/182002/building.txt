[0.6332075595855713] The building was generally well-reviewed, with guests praising the lobby, restaurant, and attached Tim Horton's.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6332075595855713] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[0.5737005472183228] Tim Hortons right in the lobby which was very convenient.
[0.5006941556930542] Nice lobby.
[0.4996815025806427] They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting.
[0.4681774377822876] It appears this hotel also serves as a university residence, but there was no noise issue with that.

[0.760350227355957] The beds were comfortable and the sheets good quality but the furniture is pretty dated and the bathroom very tired looking.
[0.5306787490844727] I saw some work being done in the lobby and wonder if they also did the rooms as our furniture looked to be new and had no damage or wear you normally see.
