[0.7887647151947021] The location was good for some people, being close to restaurants, a mall, and other attractions.

[0.7887647151947021] It is in a great location and was able to walk to some great restaurants and shopping places.
[0.6965652704238892] First impression, it was in a decent area, not too far from the central part of downtown with all the restaurants and I thought ok, not too bad.
[0.6821702718734741] The place was in a good location and I was able to walk to a huge mall and what I guess is Torontoâ€™s equivalent of Times Square.
[0.663435161113739] It is handy to shopping and night life â€“ but so are many other hotels from which to choose.
[0.6592245697975159] The view overlooked the downtown area and was close to hospitals if you were up for a brisk walk.

[0.009771729819476604] My family has said that we should return at some other time.
[0.01049182191491127] Shame they couldn't have arranged the weather!!
[0.02799760363996029] I did ask if I just could use maybe a land line but no luck.
[0.0512198731303215] I didn't eat at the restaurant, so can't comment on that.
[0.05959000810980797] My wife and I just returned after a 5 day trip to Toronto.

[0.6181966066360474] However, others found the location to be less than ideal, with expensive parking and difficult to find public parking.

[0.6181966066360474] If you are staying here be warned about the parking though.
[0.6026204824447632] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.5532115697860718] Its really tight down there, but there is also a public lot outside which you can use.
[0.5526708364486694] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.5341328382492065] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.

[-0.019411101937294006] The restaurant buffet for breakfast was good, the wait staff was very pleasant.
[-0.006825592368841171] My wife and I really enjoy this time we have to spend with the kids while they still think these trips are "cool".
[-0.0019517876207828522] Was a great start to our mini vacation and looking forward now to seeing the falls.
[0.0026065995916724205] The restaurant was also a great deal since our kids ate free from the buffet since they are younger.
[0.016558561474084854] Overall our event went well and we do plan to hold our next meeting in the same room.
