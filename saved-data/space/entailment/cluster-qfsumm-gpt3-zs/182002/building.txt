[0.2992591857910156] The building was generally well-reviewed, with guests praising the lobby, restaurant, and attached Tim Horton's.

[0.2992591857910156] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[0.0055217742919921875] Tim Hortons right in the lobby which was very convenient.
[0.0020189285278320312] Nice lobby.
[0.00098419189453125] The property was much better then I expected.
[-7.62939453125e-05] They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting.

[-0.7514758110046387] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.
[-0.5593338012695312] Our car was broken into.
[-0.3630809783935547] There aren't many facilities and the internet in my room cut out once in a while.
[-0.3588218688964844] The beds were comfortable and the sheets good quality but the furniture is pretty dated and the bathroom very tired looking.
[-0.10980987548828125] We had many people coming for this conference that had scratched their cars or some that cracked their exhaust pipe.

[-0.0026912689208984375] However, some guests noted that there are no fire sprinklers in the guest areas, and that the elevator alarm button is often broken.

[-0.0030984878540039062] Nice lobby.
[-0.00327301025390625] Be prepared to wait at least five minutes, and the doors sensors do not work, which was very annoying.

[-0.1282196044921875] (Coming off the street, the turns were tight and narrow.)
[-0.09931182861328125] You have to drive very slow and carefully to make sure you don't damage your car.
[-0.09037017822265625] We were lost in a city we HAD never been in for 10 mintues during the night.
[-0.0828399658203125] It wasn't obvious and I only noticed it because I was accessing a wall plug behind the bedside table.

[0.002429962158203125] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!

[-0.2198944091796875] I saw some work being done in the lobby and wonder if they also did the rooms as our furniture looked to be new and had no damage or wear you normally see.
[-0.07877731323242188] We also experienced the subway and found it was very easy to get around.
[-0.074737548828125] It was quickley rectified and someone brought me a new iron within minuets.
