[0.029266357421875] The reviews were mixed, but generally speaking, people found the rooms to be clean and comfortable, though some found issue with the size of the elevators and the continental breakfast.

[0.029266357421875] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
[0.0018901824951171875] It's not a highend hotel, but it's great value for the price.
[0.001445770263671875] Overall, a good central location for the price I paid, but I choose another hotel if given the choic again.
[0.00055694580078125] Other than the hotel is OK, but far from great.

[-0.9448964595794678] Nothing in the room felt clean and I agree with one reviewer that the bed "crunched".
[-0.9375312328338623] Exhausted, we walked into our room, and experienced the most overwhelming foul smells, I canâ€™t even describe!
[-0.933251142501831] The room was so filthy, we decided to leave, and find another hotel.
[-0.8997020721435547] The rooms are old, the bathroom smelled, we had a view of air conditioners and the gym was a joke.
[-0.782465934753418] The shower was disgusting and there were marks all over the walls and carpet.
