[0.1090850830078125] The reviews were mostly negative, citing poor customer service, unreliable elevators and wireless internet, and a general feeling that the staff were only interested in money.

[0.1090850830078125] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.
[0.05755615234375] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.039745330810546875] The staff made no effort to give guests priority on them, either.
[0.027912139892578125] All they want is money.
[0.025287628173828125] Don't stay at this hotel unless you like slow (and possibly unsafe) elevators, flaky wireless Internet, and poor customer service.
