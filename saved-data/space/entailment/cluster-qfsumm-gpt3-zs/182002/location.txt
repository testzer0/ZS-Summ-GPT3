[0.3494539260864258] The location was good for some people, being close to restaurants, a mall, and other attractions.

----- Supporting -----

[0.3494539260864258] It is in a great location and was able to walk to some great restaurants and shopping places.
[0.19295883178710938] This hotel is near everything; subway, restaurants, shopping.
[0.1779937744140625] It is handy to shopping and night life â€“ but so are many other hotels from which to choose.
[0.14548587799072266] The place was in a good location and I was able to walk to a huge mall and what I guess is Torontoâ€™s equivalent of Times Square.
[0.13724517822265625] surrounded by great restauants and a healthy walking distance to shops, Air Canada Centre, CN Tower.

[-0.25511932373046875] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).
[-0.1433696746826172] Heed this warning stay away from this crappy place, you'll be glad you did.
[-0.123138427734375] Across the street from the old Maple Leaf Gardens, and it looks like a new grocery store is about to open up there soon.
[-0.11740875244140625] The view overlooked the downtown area and was close to hospitals if you were up for a brisk walk.
[-0.08710861206054688] Only good thing was that it was a few blocks from the subway.

[0.17516326904296875] However, others found the location to be less than ideal, with expensive parking and difficult to find public parking.

----- Supporting -----

[0.17516326904296875] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.15825653076171875] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.11536407470703125] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
[0.1009979248046875] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.043853759765625] After circling the hotel trying to find a parking spot which I eventually did about 1/4 mile from the hotel (on the street), a bum waited in front of my car asking for money.

[-0.1008453369140625] THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.
[-0.07570075988769531] Was very safe and you could only access the parking lot with a hotel key.
[-0.05779838562011719] Its really tight down there, but there is also a public lot outside which you can use.
[-0.042327880859375] I did ask if I just could use maybe a land line but no luck.
[-0.04119586944580078] The subway station is only a few blocks away and the street car passes right in front of the hotel.
