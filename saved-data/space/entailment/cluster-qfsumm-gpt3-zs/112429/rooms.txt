[-0.9977335929870605] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.99761962890625] The room is shabby, the shower made a horrible noise whenever the water was running.
[-0.9931340217590332] The halls had a very odd smell, like a dental office.
[-0.9906158447265625] The biggest issue is that upon going to bed the first night, I noticed an overpowering smell of urine in my bed.
[-0.9896078109741211] I was put in a room that just didn't have the feeling be being fresh and clean.
