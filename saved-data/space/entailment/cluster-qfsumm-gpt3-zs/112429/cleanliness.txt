[-0.0013766288757324219] Getting my car from the valet took less than three minutes... My stay at the Paramount was a very pleasant and positive experience.
[-0.0018415451049804688] My companion and I stayed at this hotel because it was one of the most affordable on the day we went.
[-0.001911163330078125] It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.
[-0.002201080322265625] Lolita was great as well.
[-0.0026836395263671875] The Dragonfish Sushi is right in the hotel downstairs.

[-0.3709850311279297] There is no complimentary anything.
[-0.23521041870117188] I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.
[-0.15774917602539062] The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.
[-0.1533660888671875] The night before I needed to leave there was a big snowstorm in town, and I was worried the rail system would not be running the next morning.
[-0.1478137969970703] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.

[0.02133941650390625] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.
[0.01264190673828125] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.
[0.0068492889404296875] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.00612640380859375] The only thing I didn't care for was the fitness center, which was sort of a dungeon in the basement.
[0.00508880615234375] I called down to the front desk to find out what time housekeeping would be coming by as I wanted to have a nap before I went to the game.

[-0.12320327758789062] The valet man was excellent.
[-0.10863399505615234] We were also provided with free Wifi, which was great!
[-0.10735893249511719] The decor was cool and modern.
[-0.0933685302734375] The best thing is they have an empty fridge so you can put all your goodies that you buy from pike place inside
[-0.06816291809082031] The concierge was more than polite as he parked our car which was included in our package.
