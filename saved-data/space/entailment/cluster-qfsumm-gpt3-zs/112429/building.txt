[0.3753166198730469] The building is older but well-maintained, and it is undergoing exterior renovations.

[0.3753166198730469] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.
[0.0317840576171875] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.
[0.025167465209960938] The hotel was under exterior renovations, but that worked out for me as I was out of my room for most of the day.
[0.002490997314453125] The lobby of the hotel is quite small, but well-appointed.
[0.000263214111328125] Nice lobby.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.5470371246337891] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.44184112548828125] We nearly thought our car was stolen!
[-0.32843017578125] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[-0.1718006134033203] My desk chair was broken and I asked for it to be replaced or fixed.
[-0.1669483184814453] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.

[-0.7603321075439453] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.3930931091308594] The man who was working at the front desk looked very gruff and mean, when I would ask something he made me feel like I was putting him out.
[-0.190399169921875] the lobby is sort of lackluster but the rooms were tasfully updated and very clean.
[-0.1571502685546875] We nearly thought our car was stolen!
