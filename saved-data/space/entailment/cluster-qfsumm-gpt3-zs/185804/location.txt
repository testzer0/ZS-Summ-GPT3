[-0.9938011169433594] We held our wedding reception at the Hotel's lounge and found that we were overall very disappointed.
[-0.4943685531616211] Do not hire a car and try to park it here.
[-0.32984447479248047] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[-0.16897964477539062] There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.

[0.23263168334960938] It is right on the water with a view of Vancouver, there is lots to do and see in the area, and it is easy to get to from the ferry.

[0.23263168334960938] The wonderful public market and numerous restaurants and shops are just a quick walk away, as are the ferries that take you to other parts of Vancouver.
[0.19431495666503906] Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes.
[0.08675003051757812] Located in a wonderful location for walking and sightseeing, we loved being close to the Granville Island market, and enjoying the stunning maritime scenery of Vancouver.
[0.07639312744140625] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[0.0644073486328125] This hotel is located close enough to downtown to walk to in 1/2 hour( using the aquabus to cross the channel) but also very close to local interesting sites on granville island and is a 15 min walk to Broadway St and 4th Ave where there are numerous placed to eat.

[-0.9946634769439697] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.8215208053588867] Meaning you had to go out on to the balcony and look to your right to see water.
[-0.7399978637695312] We opened our window to a view of the creek.
[-0.7180309295654297] There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.
[-0.6343955993652344] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.

[-0.0003070831298828125] The location, although not downtown, was still great.

[-0.08774185180664062] Its out of the way, but in the middle of everything.
[-0.06563282012939453] Being on the sea wall makes it safe and impossible to get lost.
[-0.06292915344238281] or Google Map and simply printed the directions.
[-0.059393882751464844] The dining room in the hotel is the Dockside Restaurant which offers a fine menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
