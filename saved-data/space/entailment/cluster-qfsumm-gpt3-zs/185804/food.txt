[-0.9633054733276367] Food isnt great but you are right by the market.
[-0.952538013458252] so that when we bought food to bring back to the room, we had nothing to eat it with.
[-0.9221248626708984] In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.
[-0.6501312255859375] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.
[-0.5329084396362305] For old times sake, we even had lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory, but the food wasn't very good, so we decided to give the city a miss and pootle around the Island instead .

[-0.2679901123046875] It was a bottle of wine with a miniature tuxedo jacket around the bottle.
[-0.24273109436035156] Really rocking and that's not a bad thing eh :) But chasing down something to eat this late on the island was hopeless.
