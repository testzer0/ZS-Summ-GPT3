[0.9733314514160156] Bad Points * half renovated the common areas are nice, the bathrooms have no bath tubs but new bathrooms.
[0.005326271057128906] The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.
[0.004047393798828125] Nothing a little renovation couldn't quickly take care of.
[0.0018405914306640625] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[-0.001407623291015625] We went to the Pacific Culinary Institute and that was amazing!

[-0.7968978881835938] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.6346054077148438] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
[-0.5406837463378906] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[-0.169097900390625] While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
[-0.167205810546875] There is no easy chair.
