[0.0124969482421875] The location is superb - close to restaurants, supermarkets and Disney.
[0.00942087173461914] However the best bit of this hotel is by far the location, just 2 mile from Disney and surrounded by quality restaurants and shops, you can not go wrong.
[0.008884429931640625] Location was good - on the 192, 5mins from Interstate 4 - 40mins sea world and universal, 1hr to Busch Gardens, 1hr 15 to Kennedy Space Center.
[0.007435321807861328] The hotel is well situated for all the theme parks especially the Disney parks and there are plenty of shops and other attractions in the local area.

[-0.7691555023193359] You walk on the carpet just feels so sticky.. About the location, compared to the other on celebrations area, seems not so close to those theme parks.
[-0.5547256469726562] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[-0.5377020835876465] Has to be the worst place I ever stayed.
[-0.3558540344238281] One block to Dennys and Walgreens.
[-0.3357276916503906] It's not the best location as you do need to drive everywhere but that was all part of the fun for us!!

[0.01470184326171875] Although this is by no means a luxurious residence, it is a perfect place to stay if you are intending to visit the theme parks, although a car is essential.
[0.004062652587890625] I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.

[-0.05736064910888672] It was a good location, plenty of restaurants nearby and easy access to major routes The heated swimming pool was lovely with fresh towels piled high.
[-0.057239532470703125] Free shuttle to parks.
[-0.03449440002441406] We would stay here again, if you want more luxury it is not for you, if you want a clean safe place and conveniently located for parks then its perfect!
[-0.03001689910888672] The road leading out onto the back exit takes you to Disney in 5 minutes flat!!
