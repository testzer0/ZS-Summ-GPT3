[0.7855339050292969] Overall, reviewers thought the hotel was comfortable, although some furniture was a bit old.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7855339050292969] Ok so the furniture was a bit tired but stuff worked, plenty of hot water and there was a microwave and fridge in the room.
[0.34833717346191406] The furniture, i.e tv unit and clothes drawers seemed to be the only thing that seemed a little tired, but not so much that you would notice.
[-0.00096893310546875] I would certainly reccomend this property to anyone who desires a comfortable "sleeper" at a great price
[-0.0012302398681640625] We have been to this complex a number of times.
[-0.0029125213623046875] When we arrived, although the front desk staff could not find our reservation, I showed them my confirmation sheet and they fixed everything.

[-0.13002395629882812] Small gift/corner shop, internet access.
[-0.1298370361328125] We would have struggled without the hire car so I would advise you to get one!
[-0.10187530517578125] The property though was not nice at all.
[-0.0942840576171875] A must is a car because travelling around on foot is hard the roads are really hard to cross you take your life into your own hands and wait up to 15 mins for the lights to change and watch the traffic from the right because while your crossing they are too.
[-0.08731842041015625] A car will definitely be handy.
