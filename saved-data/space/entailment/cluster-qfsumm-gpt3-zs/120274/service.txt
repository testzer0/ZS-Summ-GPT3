[0.7386932373046875] It was noted that the shuttle service to the theme parks was on time and free of charge.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7386932373046875] The shuttle service (free) was on time (give or take 10 mins) to the theme parks.
[0.22039794921875] I took the free shuttle bus to the theme parks and expected to get to the entrance before 9:00a.m.
[0.16208648681640625] Hotel does supply free shuttle buses to all theme parks which go every day and you don't have to bye your tickets from the guest services at the front of the hotel happy holidays.
[0.0109710693359375] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
[0.00046539306640625] The Hotel does provide free shuttle buses to Sea world, Universal/Islands of Adventure & to the Epcot Centre (transfer by Monorail at Epcot for the other Disney parks).

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9953794479370117] First, the shuttle service they offered took us to the wrong theme park 40 minutes late without any explanation.
[-0.9680252075195312] Also, they hit you up with some kind of $1.86 a night fee tacked onto your bill...surprise!
[-0.9474124908447266] Might have to wait for second bus.
[-0.9325990676879883] Never ever use them again!
[-0.9282817840576172] The evening clerk was a little weak in communicating in English so I really didn't get an adequate explanation of the charge.

[0.125457763671875] However, some reviewers found the shuttle service to be slow and only running to certain parks.

----- Supporting -----

[0.125457763671875] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
[0.11951065063476562] From previous experience from other hotels they usually only have limited pick ups for the parks.
[0.1059722900390625] First, the shuttle service they offered took us to the wrong theme park 40 minutes late without any explanation.
[0.0197906494140625] Don't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney!
[0.00130462646484375] however this is not the hotels fault but Disney as they put on the transport.
