[-0.6527271270751953] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.5334968566894531] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.23242950439453125] I had two problems with this place, first when I arrived home the day of our last stay I reviewed the invoice which had been emailed to me and was charged $202.00 for a dinner at Charlie Palmers, but we never dined at Charlie Palmers.
[-0.11625289916992188] Well let me start by stating, Tripadvisor isn't such a friendly review system.
[-0.09400177001953125] I know this could happen anywhere but in years of valet parking it hasnt so this was quite annoying.

[-0.00302886962890625] So overall I would recommend the hotel but just double check EVERYTHING on your invoice.
[-0.0041141510009765625] I do think it is a lovely hotel but I would like to mention the lighting in the rooms was terrible.
[-0.004596710205078125] Also for the ladies one of Dallas' best spas (Sedona - lady's only) is across the street but make sure and get appointment in advance as my wife couldn't get same day appointment on Saturday.
