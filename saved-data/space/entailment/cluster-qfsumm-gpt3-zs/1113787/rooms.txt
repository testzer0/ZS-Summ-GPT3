[0.03509521484375] The reviewers were mixed in their opinions of the rooms.

----- Supporting -----

[0.03509521484375] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[0.0260009765625] They finally were ok with the outside food once they realized we were NOT moving it and were still quite unhappy about the pool situation.
[0.00897216796875] Didn't really bother us because it was laid out well but if we had been there a number of days and spent them in the room, it would have gotten cramped.
[0.0058135986328125] 1 - the hotel smells great but it is a little strong for me.
[0.0016231536865234375] Charlie Palmer cooks the room service menu but it is different menu than restaurant and didn't look as good (no foie gras).

[-0.9951081275939941] After reading all of the brilliant reviews on The Joule, I selected it for my wedding night.
[-0.9940261840820312] We stayed here for an Anniversary weekend getaway in Dallas and we were very impressed with the rooms and the service!
[-0.9864816665649414] Our tweens loved the salt water heated infinity pool, the Charlie Palmer bar, awesome room service and gorgeous room......we live in Carrollton, but felt we had traveled to another luxurious country!
[-0.9500083923339844] The room was immaculate - superbly decorated, super clean, and there was a complimentary bottle of champagne for us, with truffles and a lovely note from the manager.

[0.694854736328125] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.2504425048828125] They had free bottle of wine and chocolates in our room for our anniversary which was nice but I had to ask 3 times for ice bucket (it is small hotel so there are no ice machines on the floors).
[0.2361297607421875] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[0.211395263671875] The rooms are awesome except for the lack of privacy in the toilets that others have mentioned.

[-0.8276634216308594] They have a special lunch that includes a soup, salad and half sandwich that's quick and inexpensive.
[-0.6801376342773438] The rooms were fantastic, very clean, and had awesome showers!!!
[-0.5449447631835938] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.5236129760742188] The Joule has a modern feel kind of like the W but it is warmer feeling and more comforatble than the W. The pool at the Joule is amazing and is actually where they film the outdoor bar scenes for ABC's The Deep End which is the show is set in LA but is actually filmed in Dallas.
[-0.5004501342773438] Everything from room service from the top Charlie Palmer restaurant in the hotel 24/7, plus the stunning gorgeous pool, amazing rooms, etc, etc.

[0.0057220458984375] My only complaint about our room was that one side faced east and the bathroom window was not adequately covered so the morning sun lit up the whole room.

[0.0014896392822265625] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".
