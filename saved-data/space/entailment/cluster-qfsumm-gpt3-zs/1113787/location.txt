[0.9078612327575684] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7552261352539062] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[-0.7108402252197266] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[-0.3008136749267578] Trip to this hotel started off VERY poorly with a bungled reservation.
[-0.22867202758789062] The guest who remained were forced to go across the street to a dive bar where the b-day girl began to cry uncontrollably over her ruined special evening.
[-0.2202606201171875] This hotel has a very cramped feel.

[0.9886603355407715] However, it is also in a somewhat cramped area with a loading dock at the front of the building.

[0.9886603355407715] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.

[0.0069427490234375] The staff at the hotel and the parking company (ACE parking) are working hard to rectify the situation, but at $27/night for parking one would hope that her car was more secure than it apparently was.
[0.0057373046875] There is a Neiman Marcus and a decent Mexican restaurant next door, but there's also a boarded up building.
[0.0046024322509765625] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.44904327392578125] It is clear this hotel has no loading dock or alley because while I was eating dinner at the award winning restaurant downstairs (Charlie Palmer's) I had big trucks pulling up within 10 ft of my table loading and unloading big crates of towels (I learned they outsource their linens) and other large pieces of equipment.
