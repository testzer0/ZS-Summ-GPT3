[0.8226356506347656] Overall, reviewers thought the building was modern and well-equipped, with a beautiful lobby.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8226356506347656] In addition to being spacious, the lobby was decorated in a modern fashion with booth-like check-in desk, complete with a very professional and courteous staff who checked us in promptly.
[0.3487701416015625] The lobby refurb looked great -- now they just need to tackle some of the older rooms.
[0.2660503387451172] The lobby was modern with a beautiful fireplace and a good breafast/coffee/drinks bar too.
[0.26407432556152344] We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.
[0.19099044799804688] The lobby is very appealing and the front desk staff were professional and polite.

[-0.7105503082275391] Think it's in real need of refurbishment.
[-0.6339035034179688] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[-0.12041282653808594] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
[-0.07151031494140625] While there is a garbage strike going on, the city was still relatively clean and everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful.

[0.019256591796875] They also really need more than 1 elevator to the parking garage.
[0.00310516357421875] My only advice is to ask for a room opposite the construction side...

[-0.072296142578125] Of course, when you arrive at the mall, you're in the ladies lingerie dept.
[-0.04832649230957031] Modern facility, quiet.
[-0.02210235595703125] We were working on an important project.
[-0.02014923095703125] Everything was as expected, good check in, great location, nice room, good staff, etc....then about 11:00pm the fire alarms went off.

[0.020275115966796875] There were some complaints about the fire alarm going off, but staff were generally praised for their handling of the situation.

----- Supporting -----

[0.020275115966796875] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!
[0.005950927734375] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!
[0.0009565353393554688] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[0.0003337860107421875] Everything was as expected, good check in, great location, nice room, good staff, etc....then about 11:00pm the fire alarms went off.
[0.0002231597900390625] Had some idiot pull fire alarm at 4 am on Sunday, but was resolved within 30 minutes and not having to evacuate.

[-0.019786834716796875] It is connected to the Eaton Centre and there is a subway station there.
[-0.0196075439453125] Under that mall is the subway station, so you can actually get on the subway without ever going outside.

[0.033050537109375] The location was also praised, with the subway station being close by.

[0.0011358261108398438] Great lobby to hang out in.
[0.0008974075317382812] Its a pretty cool thing to be able to walk right into torontos biggest mall in just two minutes.
