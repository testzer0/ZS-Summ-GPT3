----- Weakening -----

[-0.9956479072570801] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.9908971786499023] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[-0.990257740020752] Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff.
[-0.982785701751709] The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all".
[-0.9821567535400391] Front desk staff were not the friendliest...common to big cities perhaps?

[0.01674652099609375] However, some guests had issues with the phone system in their rooms not working, and cots not being delivered in a timely manner.

----- Supporting -----

[0.01674652099609375] The issue I had is that the phone system in some of the rooms was not functioning when I checked in.
[0.0149383544921875] Called down twice, still no cots, finally my husband had to go down to complain at desk, finally 20 minutes later got both of the cots.
[0.0131683349609375] I tried to hook up my computer to the internet in the room afterwards, but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue.
[0.00475311279296875] The rest of my stay was great but definately need to get a new system in place for business travellers.. Id recommend Hilton Downtown or Marriott Airport Locations for Business Trips.
[0.0019512176513671875] But hotel staff did their best to help.

[-0.05682563781738281] What made it even more special was that they sent up to the room chocolate dipped strawberries and drinks along with a anniversary card signed by each member of thier team.
[-0.0449981689453125] Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff.
[-0.03685188293457031] Every interaction I had with the staff was perfect.
[-0.035633087158203125] This adds up for someone who needs to be connected.
[-0.035388946533203125] They said "he" was called and must be busy.

[0.773712158203125] The hotel's internet connection was also criticized as being pricey.

----- Supporting -----

[0.773712158203125] One is my usual complaint of charging the exhorbitant fees for internet access in the guest rooms...this drives me crazy that I can go to a Holiday Inn Express and get free wireless internet in my room but the higher end hotels charge for it.
[0.3426513671875] And what is it with hotels charging more than $300 a night and still nickle and diming you with a daily internet charge?
[0.17935943603515625] They charged us 17 Dollars for the internet a day.. which would have been fine had there been a fast wifi connection or multiple ethernet connections in the room.
[0.12528038024902344] Internet connection in room rather pricey.
[0.03127288818359375] I was disappointed with the Internet service, though: $15 + $3 service charge daily, from noon to noon, with some interruptions.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.14636993408203125] Great service is offered without the expectation of a gratuity.
[-0.10818862915039062] I didn't bother complaining since we were only there for 2 nights.
[-0.07828330993652344] They arranged rental car service for us as well as airport transport.. All very reasonably priced and on time.
[-0.05040311813354492] Every interaction I had with the staff was perfect.
