[0.00240325927734375] The rooms were clean, but when you looked closely, you would feel it needed a deep clean.. Ie around baseboards, walls and ceiling in bath, etc.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7857589721679688] I was concerned about a recent report of bedbugs at this hotel on another website, and so I was prepared to cancel our reservation.
[-0.5789356231689453] other issues- bathroom really not that nice, concierge horrible at recommending things to do or good resutarants or giving directions.
[-0.2616996765136719] At check-out we mentioned it again, but nothing was done.
[-0.23639678955078125] Poor QC here.
[-0.18226051330566406] My biggest negative would be the super thin, over starched towels.
