[0.06800270080566406] However, some reviewers noted that the rooms facing the office building did not have much privacy.

----- Supporting -----

[0.06800270080566406] Also a lot of the rooms face an office building, so theres not much privacy, because the curtains are very easily seen through, but overall if your willing to pay over 250 a night, your really only paying for the location and the walkway to the mall.
[0.0007076263427734375] Overall a very good hotel to use as a base for exploring Toronto but not quite up to the Marriott standards I have come to expect.
[0.0005207061767578125] However, the rooms are very average (no safe, mini-bar for example).
[0.00027561187744140625] This is a renovated Marriott with an above average lobby and room.
[0.0001392364501953125] Rooms were spotless, and big enough.

[-0.17479705810546875] Because the hotel backs onto a small courtyard, you could not hear any street noise.
[-0.06460094451904297] The beds were nice and we had a view of the church next door.
[-0.03802490234375] Nice courtyard right outside hotel as you head to Eaton Centre.
[-0.03613471984863281] The room was a good size and looked out over the church next door, plus it was useful to be able to go straight through into the Eaton Centre.
[-0.03464221954345703] One of the things that make people willing to pay a lot of money for this place is because the hotel has a walkway that goes right into the eaton centre mall.
