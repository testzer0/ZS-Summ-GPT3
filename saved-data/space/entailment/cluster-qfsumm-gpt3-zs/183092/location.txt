[0.9009895324707031] The location was an excellent one for us because our event was just across the street, but we also walked to dinner on Queen Street, had many shopping choices (itâ€™s connected to the Eaton Centre, or you can meander along funky Queen West) and itâ€™s close to the subway.
[0.7338409423828125] Addtionally, there were pleny of wonderful restaurants, places to shop, the subway transit system, buses and taxes within a 1-5 mile radius of the hotel making it very convenient for just about everything!

[-0.9784088134765625] If you have children under 8 they will love the fairground at centreville on the islands but avoid Wonderland unless you have teenage children who can go by themselves, the queues were over an hour long for many rides and it feels bleak and bland.
[-0.9744367599487305] It was a nice hotel, but I would recommend staying closer to the center of activities.
[-0.9431490898132324] It looked like we were lucky to get a parking spot.
[-0.9412298202514648] The location is reasonable but quite a long way from the waterfront.
[-0.8717842102050781] My only negative comment about the room was the view - it looked straight into an adjacent office building.
