----- Supporting -----

[-0.0008087158203125] There was one occasion in which we ordered from the menu, sadly it was a little disappointing because it was overcooked but we were taken care of almost immediately when we complained.

[0.0573883056640625] The first night our food orders took forever and tonight I never got my slice of pie and our second round of drinks never arrived.
[0.036163330078125] Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
[-0.0013570785522460938] There are just a few fast-food eateries near the entrance of the hotel.
[-0.001407623291015625] Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.
