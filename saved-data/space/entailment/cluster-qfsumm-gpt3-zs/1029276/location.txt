[0.13460540771484375] Bayside Plaza is a short taxi ride away which is a lot of fun especially on Super Bowl week end and the Metromover is just a block away which gives access to Metrorail.
[0.08594512939453125] The hotel is a three minute walk to the Metromover which will take you to Bayside in a couple of minutes where there is nightlife, shops, drinks, and restaurants.
[0.01639556884765625] Everything was pretty close and accessible from the hotel (Bayside, South Beach, Coconut Grove etc.)

[0.5630950927734375] Some reviewers found the location convenient, while others found it lacking in amenities.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5630950927734375] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.1052093505859375] Give it 4 out of 5 for location, but 2 out of 5 for service.
[0.0373077392578125] Relaxing versus the 24 hour party going on at South Beach (though that was great as well).

[0.02130889892578125] No bar fridge in the room if you want to keep something cold.
