[0.5096263885498047] The hotel is undergoing construction and renovation, which can be disruptive and inconvenient for guests.

[0.5096263885498047] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.3032360076904297] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
[0.15192413330078125] Also lots of construction on the streets make sure you plan to leave a bit early especially on the weekend.
[0.020984649658203125] The renovations were the least of our worries.
[0.010129928588867188] And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor.
