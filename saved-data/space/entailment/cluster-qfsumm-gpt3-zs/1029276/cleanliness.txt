[0.12159919738769531] Room was very sub-standard for cleanliness...floor looked like it never gets vacuumed.
[0.07583045959472656] They also did an extremely lousy job in cleaning the room.
[0.06200408935546875] One or two issues during our stay included :- Housekeeping - at least 2 days out of the 5 our room was not made up and we had to chase housekeeping.
[0.023529052734375] The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
[0.00890350341796875] HOUSEKEEPING: Never understood that there were 4 people in the room (room can hold 5) and choose to only put towels for 3 each day we were day (4 days) despite many calls to the front desk.
