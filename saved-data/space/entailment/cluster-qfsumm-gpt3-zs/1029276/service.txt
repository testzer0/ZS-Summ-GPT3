[0.043483734130859375] Overall, reviewers found the Hilton Miami Downtown to have great food and service, though bar service could be improved.

----- Supporting -----

[0.043483734130859375] We felt that an establishment of this nature in this location and carrying the Hilton brand should have made staff available to man the lounge at the times stated.
[0.0105133056640625] The room was spacious and bathroom clean with great views over the bay and the breakfast was awesome, the staff throughout the hotel were very polite and helpful.
[0.009059906005859375] Bar service at busy times was a little haphazard - incorrect orders although they did make amends for errors.
[0.006870269775390625] Other than that all was well, staff was friendly.
[0.00637054443359375] There Is a dedicated attendant in a booth working but she doesn't pick up her phone...what's the point.

[-0.7875862121582031] I called often and continued to get unsatisfactory answers.
[-0.7758626937866211] I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami.
[-0.5471324920654297] Not impressed.
[-0.33966541290283203] Downtown did not feel safe at all, and there were alot of unsavoury looks as we did walk 4 blocks from the Hotel.
