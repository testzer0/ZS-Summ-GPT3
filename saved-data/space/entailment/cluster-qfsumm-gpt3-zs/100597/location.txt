[0.9506397247314453] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
[0.14175891876220703] The good news - the hotel is very close to the airport with a 24hr shuttle to the airport.
[0.078643798828125] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[0.04830169677734375] The hotel is conveniently located, just across the street from the airport entrance with a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes.
[0.0407562255859375] This hotel was within a stone's throw of Sea-Tac airport and right next to the off-site Thrifty car rental lot, so for location, it was great.

[-0.9197578430175781] We were told we had a great view of the "lake" from our room.
[-0.6686801910400391] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
[-0.6567554473876953] Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water.
[-0.5523567199707031] We parked our car there for a week, and were impressed with the service and rates compared with the airport.
[-0.5200958251953125] If you are not using the airport shuttle this hotel is great.

[0.017024993896484375] It had easy access to the light rail located at the airport (we took the DT shuttle over), and was next to an Enterprise car rental.
[0.013454437255859375] This was right by the SeaTac Airport, whereby they had a shuttle that would come every 20 mins, and the valet would park the vehicle while we off traveling.
[0.004497528076171875] Good jumping off spot for wherever you want to go.
[0.0042266845703125] We took the shuttle from the airport, and then back again to pick up our rental car (save the parking fee).

[-0.5619277954101562] Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water.
[-0.47333526611328125] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[-0.4402427673339844] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.
[-0.3725109100341797] Unfortunately there was no wifi and the parking was $16 per night - expensive for the area.

[0.0068817138671875] --Rooms have a small deck, but the view is of the airport - nothing spectacular.
[0.00214385986328125] Just too too big for a one night stay, but a lovely hotel after all.
[0.0019321441650390625] All in all a good airport property.
[0.0012378692626953125] If you are staying near the airport, it is a great hotel.
[0.0011997222900390625] But it is fine for what it is- a quick, convenient, comfortable stay by the airport.

[-0.113861083984375] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!
[-0.08671188354492188] That's where I parked.
[-0.085235595703125] I think parking cost $12 or so.
[-0.0779571533203125] :) The only complaint is - parking for overnight cost $16, and on top of that, we had $1.40 of tax!!!
