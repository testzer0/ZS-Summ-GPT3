[0.0013580322265625] The reviews were mixed on the cleanliness of the hotel.

----- Supporting -----

[0.0013580322265625] Cheap toiletries, few towels.
[-0.003070831298828125] The fitness room is small but the bedrooms are standard.
[-0.004802703857421875] Check in was very quick and was assigned a two queen room in the tower.
[-0.005100250244140625] Unfortunately there was no wifi and the parking was $16 per night - expensive for the area.
[-0.007060050964355469] For those using the hotel to fly there are shuttles, flight info, and a kiosk to print out boarding passes (although it did not work for me).

[-0.9101009368896484] We loved the decor of the hotel.
[-0.733489990234375] Keep your children away from these set ups, they are going to injure someone terribly!
[-0.31807899475097656] The check-in was wonderful, the staff great, and the hotel itself was nice.
[-0.2159404754638672] Despite the low rate, the receptionist tried to give us the type of room I wanted (high floor, one bed) and was very pleasant to me.
[-0.1934661865234375] When you finally reach your room the heaters all make tremendous noise, rattle, rumble.

[0.1812286376953125] There was a stain on the carpet but otherwise it was clean and well maintained.
[-0.0021266937255859375] In spite of the fact that a large convention was concluding and check-out time was not until noon, they had our room ready and waiting.
[-0.002624034881591797] The fitness room is small but the bedrooms are standard.
[-0.0027685165405273438] We have stayed at several Seatac airport hotels, all acceptable.
[-0.0030417442321777344] We found the Doubletree to be good for what we needed- a place to stay when our plane arrived late and we didn't want to start driving anywhere until the next day.

[0.15932464599609375] Overall, it seems that the cleanliness of the hotel is decent, but there are some areas that could be improved.

----- Supporting -----

[0.15932464599609375] There was a stain on the carpet but otherwise it was clean and well maintained.
[0.0418243408203125] No facilities were open early next morning when we were headed for our flight (surprising in such a location where there were lots of people headed for early flights) and although there seem to be a lot of valet staff around, none of them made any effort to assist.
[0.035594940185546875] Hassle to get from ship to hotel, hassle to get correct rate, hassle with hotel safe (should have one in room anyway), and a hassle to get to the airport the next morning.
[0.0300750732421875] My only complaint is that they charge for the use of wifi in your room.
[0.016946792602539062] The fitness room is small but the bedrooms are standard.

[-0.03955078125] We would not stay here again because of the noise and mildew.
[-0.0268402099609375] When you finally reach your room the heaters all make tremendous noise, rattle, rumble.
[-0.015106201171875] We put the A/C on 60 and the room immediately heated the room up 89 degrees.
[-0.01372528076171875] The decor and bathroom are straight from the 70's!!
