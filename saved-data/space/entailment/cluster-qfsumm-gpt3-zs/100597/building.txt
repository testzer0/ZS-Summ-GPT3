[0.876373291015625] The hotel has unique architecture and is located near the airport.

----- Supporting -----

[0.876373291015625] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
[0.011493682861328125] It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.
[0.009838104248046875] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
[0.005841255187988281] Will stay there again in the future.
[0.005035400390625] Several fireplaces and seating areas in the lobby make it comfortable.
