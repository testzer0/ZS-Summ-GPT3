[-0.674896240234375] Never again will I waste money at this property.
[-0.5819740295410156] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[-0.4148368835449219] There were weird grease marks on the wall as well.
[-0.3389129638671875] The hotel had a indoor pool and gym facilities but didn't use them.
[-0.11586761474609375] The fire alarm went off in the ENTIRE hotel very early in the morning because someone burned toast.

[-0.09405517578125] How easy could it have been for someone else to leave with our truck if they could bring us the wrong car?
[-0.056854248046875] We had to rent a car and travel back to US to have key made.
