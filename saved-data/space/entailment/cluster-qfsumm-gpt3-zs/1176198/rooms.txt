[0.021488189697265625] There were some complaints about the lack of bathtubs in some rooms, but overall people were happy with the accommodations.

----- Supporting -----

[0.021488189697265625] For some this may not be an issue, but also be aware, most rooms do not have bathtubs, just standup showers, so if you like to bath or have children who you need to bath, this is likely not the best choice.
[0.012089729309082031] Otherwise the room was clean [and cleaned], the fridge and microwave worked too.
[0.007305145263671875] The bathroom has no bathtub (who uses that in hotels anyway?)
