----- Supporting -----

[0.5692150592803955] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!
[0.5672048330307007] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
[0.5664550065994263] We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton.
[0.5664550065994263] Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.
[0.5664550065994263] Would never stay here again and maybe not at another Hilton either.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5645416378974915] The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet!
[0.5645416378974915] The hotel restaurant was adequate; however, the staff here also strived to please.
[0.5645416378974915] Get out and see the beach and the nitelife!!!!
[0.5645416378974915] All was fresh & clean, and the view of the bay was an added perk.
[0.5648515224456787] They seem to have no idea how to run a bar.

[0.5645416378974915] So even though there was a mix up with my bag which caused me some frustration and sleeplessness, the Hilton more than made up for it.

[0.5675967931747437] Not a terrible place, but I have to say that I've stayed in nicer places that are less expensive.
[0.567480742931366] All in all, not bad if you can figure out the parking.
[0.567480742931366] Things looked not so nice a few blocks further away, so we did not walked around the area.
[0.567480742931366] Unless you have a rental car, you're at the mercy of taxis to find an interesting neighborhood since this one is so bland.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5621285438537598] On-site restaurant was simply okay, surrounding neighborhood was very blah, and the staff was ambivalent.
[0.5627351999282837] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.5646717548370361] Give it 4 out of 5 for location, but 2 out of 5 for service.
[0.5655527710914612] One other note..the restaurant in the hotel is nice but the waiters are drenched in cologne so that is all you smell and taste.
[0.5655527710914612] But other than that, not a bad place to stay.
