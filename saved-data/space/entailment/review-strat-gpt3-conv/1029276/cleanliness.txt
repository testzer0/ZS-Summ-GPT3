[0.5691641569137573] Too many hobos and drug addicts!!!
[0.5691099762916565] Room was very sub-standard for cleanliness...floor looked like it never gets vacuumed.
[0.5685009956359863] They also did an extremely lousy job in cleaning the room.

[0.5648515224456787] The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it.
[0.565058708190918] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.5664550065994263] HOUSEKEEPING: Never understood that there were 4 people in the room (room can hold 5) and choose to only put towels for 3 each day we were day (4 days) despite many calls to the front desk.

[0.5674135684967041] The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
