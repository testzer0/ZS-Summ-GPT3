----- Supporting -----

[0.5680913329124451] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[0.5677335858345032] Despite some negative comments that we read on this site we still decided to give the Hilton a chance because the location was perfect for our trip.
[0.567480742931366] I would call this a four star hotel that's slightly rough around the edges.
[0.567480742931366] Room is very clean overall.
[0.567480742931366] At first they took us to an unready room which was disappointing but after a short wait they took us to a really big room with a great harbor scene as an apology to the mess.

[0.5685998797416687] the hilton hotel downtown miami has the most amazing roof top pool and terrace.with stunning views over the port and miami.staff really helpful,and the rooms spacious clean and beds you just sink into.food and drink what you would expect to pay in city.pricey on overnight parking 28 dollars.but what a view of fireworks on new year.aesy to find and ideal if going on a cruise from miami port,only 5 mins drive.would recomend.
[0.5680468082427979] That having been said that have updated the rooms and the corner Jr. Suite is very spacious, had a great view of the bay but lacked a microwave or a mini-refrigerator???

[0.5634781718254089] Room was great, very large corner room, nice flat panel TV, fridge, the 2 outer walls were basically floor to ceiling windows with amazing views.
[0.56422358751297] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace

[0.567480742931366] The Hilton Honors lounge had a very nice breakfast available but it seemed that the superivisor was the only one who took the initiative to clean tables, so was hard to find a clean one.
[0.567480742931366] The hotel is old and needs some updating in several areas.
[0.567480742931366] Good amenities without a lot of nickel-and-diming, eg, free high-speed Internet with 5 or 6 terminals and connected printers.

[0.5684905052185059] To further my aggravation, the hotel information stated that a continental breakfast buffet was included, however when we went down the dining area and got the kids some food and sat down to eat is when we were informed that the breakfast was not included, since we were already sitting and eating it was a little too late to get up and leave, add another $60 to the bill and my deal is now no deal.
