[0.5664550065994263] The service at this hotel was poor.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5690970420837402] The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all".
[0.5690338611602783] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[0.5689201951026917] Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff.
[0.5682470798492432] Front desk staff were not the friendliest...common to big cities perhaps?
[0.567125678062439] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.

[0.5631439089775085] I tried to hook up my computer to the internet in the room afterwards, but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue.
[0.5631439089775085] Internet connection in room rather pricey.
[0.5638695955276489] I was disappointed with the Internet service, though: $15 + $3 service charge daily, from noon to noon, with some interruptions.
