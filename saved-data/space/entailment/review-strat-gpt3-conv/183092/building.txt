[0.5643813610076904] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!
[0.5645416378974915] My only advice is to ask for a room opposite the construction side...
[0.5648515224456787] Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.

[0.5635355710983276] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[0.5622735619544983] In addition to being spacious, the lobby was decorated in a modern fashion with booth-like check-in desk, complete with a very professional and courteous staff who checked us in promptly.
[0.5644662976264954] We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.
