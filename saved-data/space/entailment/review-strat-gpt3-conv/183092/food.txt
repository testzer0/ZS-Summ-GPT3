[0.568115234375] I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.
[0.5671031475067139] Concierge lounge nibbles in the evening were a little disappointing, but the staff were friendly (I think this area used to be the old steak house).
[0.5667691826820374] We are NOT demanding restaurant a patrons, but both the food and the service was poor.
[0.5664550065994263] Unlike many other hotel breakfasts, this one actually has good food!
[0.5664550065994263] The meal was pricey, but well worth it.

[0.5639829635620117] You may have a difficult fit.
[0.5648515224456787] Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.

[0.567480742931366] On each occasion I paid about $175 Canadian/night for the room (wouldn't pay a lot more for it).If shopping is not a top priority, there are probably more convenient locations for tourists to stay, but if you want to do some serious shopping, this is the place to stay.
