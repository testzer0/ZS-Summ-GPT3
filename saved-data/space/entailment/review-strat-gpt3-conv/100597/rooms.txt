[0.5691868662834167] My room, in the renovated tower, had very insufficient lighting and a bathroom that had seen better days.

[0.567480742931366] The room was okay, but not as clean as one would expect.
[0.567480742931366] My husband was hoping there was an indoor pool, but the pool was warm, and the hot tub was awesome.
[0.567480742931366] The tower rooms do have balconies but the space is shared with the room next door and divided by a set of austere looking bars--plus there is no furniture to sit on so the balconies are not really functional.
[0.567480742931366] Too bad considering the hotel facilities are lovely and the rooms are comfortable and spacious.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5637418031692505] The room was quiet, very comfy beds and we enjoyed the view from the 10th floor; the room and hallways could use an update, but are perfectly adequate.

[0.567488968372345] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[0.567480742931366] After commuting back and fort from florida if too tired to drive back to my destination i always stay at this dbl tree.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5645416378974915] With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room.
[0.5648515224456787] We LIKED the fact that it was close to new rapid transit terminal which we chose to take to stadium.
[0.5648515224456787] You could safely cross the street at the light and crosswalk and find your self at a diner or several other restaurants.
[0.5648515224456787] I am told there are good Thai and BBQ restaurants within walking distance across the street.
[0.565058708190918] Out the back of mine (#5) the deck looked out into a forest.
