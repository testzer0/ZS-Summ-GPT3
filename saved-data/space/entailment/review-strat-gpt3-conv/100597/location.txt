[0.5664550065994263] The location is close to the airport and 15 minutes away from town.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5665867328643799] The hotel is conveniently located, just across the street from the airport entrance with a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes.
[0.5664550065994263] Yes it is a bit far from downtown, but very close to the airport.
[0.5664550065994263] Staff asked family with small child to move to restaurant portion which was the right thing to do.
[0.5664550065994263] Ate at on-site bar/restaurant which was good.
[0.5664550065994263] It wasn't noisy at all as you might expect being so close to the runways.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5631439089775085] Airport pickup runs every 15 minutes.
[0.5645416378974915] This was right by the SeaTac Airport, whereby they had a shuttle that would come every 20 mins, and the valet would park the vehicle while we off traveling.
[0.5649834275245667] It is an easy drive into downtown Seattle from here and worked great for my late-arriving flight before meetings in Seattle the following morning.
[0.5654739141464233] This hotel was within a stone's throw of Sea-Tac airport and right next to the off-site Thrifty car rental lot, so for location, it was great.
[0.5654739141464233] I didn't have a car so Airport, Light Rail and many restaurants are in walking distance.

[0.5664550065994263] There is a parking fee, as well as a parking tax.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5689177513122559] :) The only complaint is - parking for overnight cost $16, and on top of that, we had $1.40 of tax!!!
[0.5689177513122559] We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee.
[0.5684054493904114] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[0.5679482221603394] Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water.
[0.567751944065094] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!

----- Weakening -----

[0.5635344982147217] This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking.
[0.5638484358787537] Shame on you Doubletree for charging your own guests to pay to park on your site during their stay.
[0.5639642477035522] I understand charging when leaving the car consecutive days when not using the hotel, but there shouldn't be a charge at a suburban hotel for guests for one night.
[0.5640160441398621] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[0.5643813610076904] Confusing layout.

**********

[0.5664550065994263] The location is convenient for those flying in or out of Sea-Tac airport, but the views from the rooms are unimpressive.

----- Supporting -----

[0.567819356918335] Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed watching airplanes takeoff and land, and this hotel provides an eagle's eye view of the airport (unless you're on the east side of the tower, in which case you're stuck looking at the snowcapped Cascades and/or Mt Rainier).
[0.5664550065994263] Yes it is a bit far from downtown, but very close to the airport.
[0.5664550065994263] Staff asked family with small child to move to restaurant portion which was the right thing to do.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5645416378974915] It looks nice on the outside,, but inside it is very shabby and used.
[0.5645416378974915] The pool area, lobby and view from the balcony were very nice, not what I normally find when traveling and especially not this close to the airport!
[0.5655527710914612] The view we had was of some large trees and some people's backyards- better than the parking lot for us (but I wouldn't want to live there!).
[0.5659942626953125] --Rooms have a small deck, but the view is of the airport - nothing spectacular.
[0.5664550065994263] It had easy access to the light rail located at the airport (we took the DT shuttle over), and was next to an Enterprise car rental.

**********

[0.5664550065994263] There is a charge for parking.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5689778327941895] What they didn't tell us when booking on the website is that the parking is $16 per night and the internet in the rooms is not wireless.
[0.5689177513122559] Parking is expensive at $25 for valet and $21.50 for self-park per night.
[0.5689177513122559] I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car.
[0.5684054493904114] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[0.5682021379470825] The parking situation was a bit weird - we had a rental we needed to return and we were given 20 free minutes to unload and get the car out, but the rental return was next door, whcih was nice.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5632641911506653] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!
[0.5632845759391785] Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax.
[0.563356339931488] We get the stay and jet package so we park for a week for only $30.00.
[0.5635282397270203] Only one hiccup when we were collecting our car through their valet ,the valet asked pretty abruptly as we $5 tipped him if we had settled our parking fee.
[0.5636456608772278] At my prompting he suggested the self-park behind the hotel but it was almost as expensive as the valet!

[0.5645416378974915] We stayed in the village part of the hotel, which were found to be old and dark.
[0.5645416378974915] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.
[0.5645416378974915] ;) BAD: --YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PARK HERE.
[0.5651390552520752] Have stayed at cheaper hotels with park n fly and they are always scary!

[0.5645416378974915] At 1am the lobby bar was still very active with a jovial but well-behaved crowd, although the bartenders were understandably ready to head home to their families.
[0.5645416378974915] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
