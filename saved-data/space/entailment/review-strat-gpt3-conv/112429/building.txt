[0.567480742931366] The elevator was marked and scuffed.
[0.567480742931366] the lobby is sort of lackluster but the rooms were tasfully updated and very clean.
[0.567480742931366] Still not sure why our car could not be found for that time.
[0.567480742931366] They could not find our car for about an hour!
[0.567480742931366] The furniture was comfortable.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5648031830787659] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[0.5651390552520752] The don't match the soft coziness of the bedding or mattress.
[0.5662662982940674] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.

[0.5664550065994263] The building was nicely appointed, but there was construction noise during the day.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5675967931747437] Tons of construction in the neighborhood which starts at 6:30 am.
[0.567480742931366] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.
[0.5665867328643799] A couple of cranes nearby with one of them directly over the hotel.
[0.5664550065994263] The man who was working at the front desk looked very gruff and mean, when I would ask something he made me feel like I was putting him out.
[0.5664550065994263] Pine Street is much easier to walk down to the Market than some of the other downtown streets (less incline.)

----- Weakening -----

[0.5645416378974915] The hotel was under exterior renovations, but that worked out for me as I was out of my room for most of the day.
[0.5655527710914612] The only thing was that there was construction going on right across the street that woke us up before 9am on a Monday morning.
[0.5655685067176819] Lots of daytime noise due to the construction.
[0.5655685067176819] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
