[0.567480742931366] It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.
[0.567480742931366] Not counting the missing kettle!
[0.5664550065994263] Lolita was great as well.
[0.5664550065994263] The Dragonfish Sushi is right in the hotel downstairs.
[0.5664550065994263] Wi-fi, however, was spotty in strength, and I frequently had difficulty maintaining a connection.

----- Weakening -----

[0.567480742931366] It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.
[0.567480742931366] The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.
[0.56746506690979] I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.
[0.566925585269928] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
[0.5664550065994263] Lolita was great as well.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5631439089775085] Not counting the missing kettle!
[0.5645416378974915] I don't like the shampoo and conditioner dispenser attached to the wall in the shower though.
[0.5645416378974915] The only thing I didn't care for was the fitness center, which was sort of a dungeon in the basement.
[0.5648515224456787] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.5649834275245667] The thermostat was worn so you could not tell which setting was A/C and which was heat.

[0.5664550065994263] There were issues with housekeeping not coming to the room and the bathroom being dirty.

[0.567480742931366] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.
[0.567480742931366] - The housekeeper walked in on me without knocking at 9 a.m. in the morning when I was getting ready to go in the shower.

[0.5664550065994263] They use energy saving compact flourescent bulbs so the room was not very bright for reading.

[0.5638695955276489] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[0.5643813610076904] Pretty basic information for a concierge to screw up on!
