[0.5664550065994263] The rooms are suspect for making people ill.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5690970420837402] The room is shabby, the shower made a horrible noise whenever the water was running.
[0.5689048767089844] The biggest issue is that upon going to bed the first night, I noticed an overpowering smell of urine in my bed.
[0.5675452947616577] Beds comfortable but the windows seemed to have drafty gaps and the air conditioning unit on it let in outside air and sound as if it was an open window.
[0.567480742931366] On this last stay, I was assigned a corner room which had great views but, because of having two windows and being on the corner of a busy street, was also a bit noisier (sirens, etc.)
[0.56746506690979] I'm normally a firm matress kind of guy, but I swear lying on that bed was like lying on a cloud.

[0.562936544418335] Other rooms might not have this problem.
[0.5631439089775085] The only complaint I have about the hotel are the beds.
[0.5641714930534363] We booked the Paramount with a little apprehension, since downtown hotels are often either industrial/impersonal or old school fusty.
[0.5645416378974915] The bathroom is the size of a closet and the hot water took forever to warm up.
[0.5645416378974915] Rooms are very clean, and modern and the service was excellent.

[0.567480742931366] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
