[0.5664550065994263] According to the reviews, the hotel is located in a decent area, but the parking situation is not ideal.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5682908296585083] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.5671546459197998] The parking garage was a little tight to drive around in, but other than that, I would definately go back for another weekend with the guys.
[0.5665867328643799] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).
[0.5664550065994263] We were there for a Chicago concert at Massey Hall and it was about a ten minute walk.
[0.5664550065994263] The hotel is situated in a good area and walking distance to Eaton Centre and many other attractions.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5645416378974915] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.5645416378974915] The first night there was no parking garage spot available, so we parked were the hotel recommended.
[0.5648515224456787] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.565058708190918] I couldn't believe they were trying to stick me for a charge when I hadn't been able to park in the garage, the spot was supposed to be free, the spot was recommended by the hotel staff, AND my car was broken into while parked there.
[0.5654739141464233] Was very safe and you could only access the parking lot with a hotel key.

**********

[0.5664550065994263] There have been reports of cars being broken into when parked in the recommended spot.

[0.5674135684967041] Didn't try the restaurant....got there late!
[0.5674135684967041] Was a good trip, especially our visit to the Hockey Hall of Fame (definitely the place to go if you have sons who live and breathe hockey) and the staff were great.
[0.5674135684967041] The yearly family vacation happened in Toronto this time.
[0.5674135684967041] We mentioned on check in that it was our anniversary and were immediately upgraded from our room with 1 double to a king room on the highest floor with a wonderful view of the city.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5643813610076904] There was a great Thai restaurant too called Jasmine Gardenâ€™s if anyone out there is into Thai food.
[0.5643813610076904] We had a breathtaking view of downtown Toronto second only to the CN Tower view.
[0.5648515224456787] Our room had a south view of the city with a fantistic view of downtown and the lake.
[0.5648515224456787] The only gripe I had really, was that the bar shut very early & we couldn`t get a beer when we returned after our night on the town.
[0.5648515224456787] I did ask if I just could use maybe a land line but no luck.

**********

[0.5664550065994263] The hotel is in a convenient location, close to Yonge & Dundas Square, restaurants, and the Air Canada Centre.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5697160959243774] There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.
[0.567480742931366] Would stay there again as price was great and location perfect.
[0.56746506690979] PS The hotel is right next to the redlight district too!
[0.56746506690979] Close to CN tower too!
[0.5665867328643799] Great location, close to CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Yonge Street, Hockey Hall of Fame.

----- Weakening -----

[0.564166784286499] surrounded by great restauants and a healthy walking distance to shops, Air Canada Centre, CN Tower.
[0.5645416378974915] The location was perfect as I walked to the Eaton Centre which was about 10 minutes away, and then the cab ride back only cost $8 including a tip.
[0.5645416378974915] Close enough to walk to the Eaton Centre.
[0.5645416378974915] The hotel is in a great location and we were close to the CN Tower, the museum and the Hockey Hall of Fame.
[0.5648515224456787] The location is good being a short walk into town and is close to the new Loblaws food emporium at Maple Leaf Gardens.

**********

[0.5664550065994263] However, the surrounding area is not particularly safe, and the hotel itself is in need of renovation.

----- Supporting -----

[0.567480742931366] The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out.
[0.567480742931366] The underground parking is horribly laid out.
[0.56746506690979] The rest of the area I would not trust to walk alone at night and there is not a great deal to do other than take a taxi west where the true city begins.
[0.5664550065994263] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5655527710914612] As other reviewers are saying, the place needs a facelift fast.
[0.5664550065994263] It was in a good location on Carlton/College Ave.
[0.5664550065994263] It was only a few blocks east of Yonge St.

[0.5688822269439697] The hotel is in a great location and we were close to the CN Tower, the museum and the Hockey Hall of Fame.
[0.5687586665153503] From the map it looked like it was pretty much in the middle of the downtown area and the rate was cheaper than some of the other hotels.
[0.5684422254562378] It is handy to shopping and night life â€“ but so are many other hotels from which to choose.
[0.5682960748672485] The Hotel is in walking distance to most major attractions and the public transportation is easily accessible.
[0.5681418180465698] The location is good and it was close to a great Thai food restaurant which I would recommend if you like Thai.

[0.5615233778953552] surrounded by great restauants and a healthy walking distance to shops, Air Canada Centre, CN Tower.
[0.5637645125389099] The hotel is within an easy walk to many attractions and shops, with a subway station close by for venturing further afield.
[0.5638695955276489] the one across the street from the "Made in China" chinese restaurant, which was decent cheap eats on it's own!
[0.5639415979385376] The hotel is in a nice location, within walking distance of everything touristy.
[0.5645416378974915] We had chosen this hotel as it was downtown and they were able to give us a discounted group rate as we had 17 rooms in total.

**********

[0.5664550065994263] However, the area around the hotel can be a bit seedy.

----- Supporting -----

[0.568408191204071] The window looking at a fantastic view north was so grimy it was hard to see through (finger and nose prints all over it) We just kept the net curtains closed so we couldn't see them and enjoyed the night lights instead.
[0.5676043629646301] When at the restaurant, they gave me catchup that was so rancid it bubbled.
[0.5676043629646301] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.567480742931366] Shame they couldn't have arranged the weather!!
[0.567480742931366] I did not trust the underground parking facilities so made sure to bring all my bags and valuables up to my room.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5604148507118225] PS The hotel is right next to the redlight district too!
[0.5630962252616882] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.

[0.5664550065994263] The underground parking is also not very easy to navigate.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5694535970687866] The underground parking is horribly laid out.
[0.5674968957901001] Its really tight down there, but there is also a public lot outside which you can use.
[0.5673651695251465] To get to the parking lot from the guest floors you will need to use an access card in the elevators; if you are not quick enough, or your card doesn't work properly, you will find that you are called to another floor.
[0.5667135715484619] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.

[0.5645416378974915] The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car.
