[0.5664550065994263] The reviews said that the rooms were adequate but overpriced, and that the view from the room was not great.

----- Supporting -----

[0.567480742931366] My only complaint about our room was that one side faced east and the bathroom window was not adequately covered so the morning sun lit up the whole room.
[0.567480742931366] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[0.567480742931366] (Not Four Seasons, Not Zaza, Not The Crescent) Get my point?
[0.5664550065994263] Let's not forget the pool, great relaxing spot.
[0.5664550065994263] This was a enjoyable place to spend the weekend .

[0.5664550065994263] This was probably one of the best Starwod properties I have stayed in the last year.
[0.5664550065994263] The hotel is about 40 minutes from DFW airport in downtown Dallas.
[0.5664550065994263] The room was spacious enough, with a big glass wall on the outside, a 42" flat screen TV, and terrific lighting arrangements that allowed you to adjust the brightness in various parts of the room.
[0.5664550065994263] The bed was very comfy.
[0.5664550065994263] The bath and toilet were divided into two separate rooms, and the sink area was separate.

[0.5664550065994263] They also said that the gym was in need of an upgrade.

[0.5664550065994263] The rooms are astonishing, my favorite detail in the entire room was the lights that are built into the headboard.

----- Supporting -----

[0.567480742931366] Please do not waste ur money go to ZAZAS, The W, or the Ritz
[0.567480742931366] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[0.567480742931366] Stay at luxury hotels frequently and would recommend ANYWHERE in dallas other than this!
[0.56746506690979] I would say for us, it was beyond luxury!
[0.56746506690979] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).

----- Weakening -----

[0.5655527710914612] Our tweens loved the salt water heated infinity pool, the Charlie Palmer bar, awesome room service and gorgeous room......we live in Carrollton, but felt we had traveled to another luxurious country!
[0.5655685067176819] Stay here - it's expensive, but absolutely worth it - we plan on returning next anniversary!

[0.5664550065994263] The rooms at the Joule are tiny and lack customer service.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5679854154586792] They had free bottle of wine and chocolates in our room for our anniversary which was nice but I had to ask 3 times for ice bucket (it is small hotel so there are no ice machines on the floors).
[0.567480742931366] Well it started off BAD within 10 mins we had went to the pool where we find about 5 young ladies workin and just stood there looking like we where not even there, so I was like excuse me can I get a drink.
[0.567480742931366] The pool is also small, but it does have a great view of downtown.
[0.5669975280761719] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.5668238997459412] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5648515224456787] We complained and they just moved us to an even smaller room with the same view.
[0.5648515224456787] Not only was no one swimming in the pool - but all of the "beautiful people" - I assume from the evening's party - were still hanging around in cocktail dresses and sportcoats.
[0.5648515224456787] AND the pool was closed for a "photo shoot" that took up the whole pool for a majority of the afternoon.
[0.5648515224456787] The pool was too chilly for the kids to spend much time in it, but that isn't surprising for this time of year.
[0.5648515224456787] The POOL scene is incredible on the roof!

**********

[0.5664550065994263] However, the bathrooms lacked privacy.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5687227249145508] I wasn't crazy about the way the bathroom is a bit open to the room.
[0.5682205557823181] other than that the bathroom is not very private so if you want to preserve the "romance" factor you'll need to make a trip to the lobby because the ballroom level restroom is kept locked.
[0.5676043629646301] Well it started off BAD within 10 mins we had went to the pool where we find about 5 young ladies workin and just stood there looking like we where not even there, so I was like excuse me can I get a drink.
[0.567480742931366] It was a salt water pool on the 12th floor that juts out over Main Street in Dallas.

[0.5664550065994263] Let's not forget the pool, great relaxing spot.
