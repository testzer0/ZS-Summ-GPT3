[0.5664550065994263] The service at this hotel is consistently poor, with long wait times, inexperienced staff, and little attention to detail.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5676043629646301] The staff are all young and good looking with little knowledge of service expectations.
[0.567480742931366] Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an "upscale" hotel.
[0.567480742931366] Absolutely ridiculous service for any hotel let alone one u pay $300+ a night for.
[0.567480742931366] My patience was def tested at this hotel at the incompetence incurred.
[0.567480742931366] It was insulting that the doorman/management were so disrespectful and unwilling to take care of their guest.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5606785416603088] Furthermore, room service was closed at 10 pm, front desk was unhelpful (in ordering a pizza nonetheless) and Charlie Palmer was a waste of time and energy (great staff, HORRIBLE management.)
[0.5648515224456787] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[0.5658624768257141] to get ONE sandwhich I had to call and ck on it and there are slow and the service is so bad and the managers know which makes it WORSE...
[0.5664550065994263] I stayed here for one night for a short business trip with meetings in Dallas downtown.
[0.5664550065994263] Turns out I was way wrong.

[0.56746506690979] After my first drink we had to flag down a girl to ask for another as the pool area was not busy maybe 6 other people so ni reason for service to be that bad.
[0.56746506690979] I suggest you take a look at the managment position as the pool ran out of Chardoney on Saturday night before 10pm and no one offered to go get us some more.

[0.567480742931366] Absolutely ridiculous service for any hotel let alone one u pay $300+ a night for.
