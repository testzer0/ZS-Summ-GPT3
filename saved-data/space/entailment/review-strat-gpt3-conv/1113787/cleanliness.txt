[0.567480742931366] The doorman refused to allow us entry and we ended up waiting for almost an hour in the Texas heat while other folks would simply walk off the street and were immediately allowed in!
[0.567480742931366] Biggest issue was when we picked up our car from the valet parking.
[0.567480742931366] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[0.5669203400611877] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
