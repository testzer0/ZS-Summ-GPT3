[0.5664550065994263] The reviewers said that the location was not good because there was no view and the ice machines did not work.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5664550065994263] I stopped into Charlie Palmer for dinner, had a fantastic time there, Tommy the bartender took great care of me and the food was out of this world.
[0.5664550065994263] Wish the weather had been nice enough to use the pool.
[0.5664550065994263] Back to the Penthouse...what a view of Dallas, both at night with all the lights and then again in the morning when we met for breakfast.
[0.5664550065994263] our names, what we liked, everyone congratulated us on our anniversary!
[0.5664550065994263] The best location in downtown Dallas.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5664550065994263] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[0.5664550065994263] There is a Neiman Marcus and a decent Mexican restaurant next door, but there's also a boarded up building.
[0.5664550065994263] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.
[0.5664550065994263] My stay at the Magnolia around the corner for the preceding two nights was far more pleasant for $150 less a night.
[0.5664550065994263] I spent 2 nights in the St. Regis in Houston prior to coming to this hotel.

[0.5664550065994263] They also said that the service was bad.

[0.5687131881713867] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.5667135715484619] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5635344982147217] It is clear this hotel has no loading dock or alley because while I was eating dinner at the award winning restaurant downstairs (Charlie Palmer's) I had big trucks pulling up within 10 ft of my table loading and unloading big crates of towels (I learned they outsource their linens) and other large pieces of equipment.
