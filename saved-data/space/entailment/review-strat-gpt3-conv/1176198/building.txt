[0.5664550065994263] The reviewers were not happy with the building, saying that it was a waste of money and that they had to rent a car to get back to the US to have a key made.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5664550065994263] The place is brand new so everything works just fine.
[0.5664550065994263] As we arrived, I was wondering why the front desk girl was all rushed while we were the only ones checking in.
[0.5664550065994263] The lobby is also small.
[0.5664550065994263] The hall was a bit noisy the first night because there were a lot of young adults staying there that night, but they finally quieted down.
[0.5664550065994263] I did hear them but maybe I just expect that city hum, having grown up in NY.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5664550065994263] How easy could it have been for someone else to leave with our truck if they could bring us the wrong car?
[0.5664550065994263] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[0.5664550065994263] (once we figured out how to work all the shower heads) The walls were very thin though-we could really hear our neighbours mini party at 2AM in the morning.
[0.5664550065994263] Definately recommend the property.
[0.5664550065994263] Nice lobby with fresh cookies in the evening.

[0.567480742931366] The descriptions of the neighborhood other reviewers made in the past are correct: there are some questionable-looking people, but that is just one of the elements of any big city.

[0.5642953515052795] The only bad things that i can mention are that during my stay another guest decided to set the fire alarm of at 04:30, not a wake up call I want to repeat.

[0.567480742931366] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
