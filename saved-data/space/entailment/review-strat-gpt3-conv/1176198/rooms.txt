[0.5682071447372437] we were so tired and sore from bad sleep we went home early on monday without shopping or anything the room was kind of plain we had the room with a jacuzzi and fireplace but both nights when we were in bed sleeping the jacuzzi mysteriously turned on and woke us both up and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off.
[0.567480742931366] The week-end floozies everywhere and drunken partners are too much !
[0.567480742931366] So, I can recommend the hotel, but please stay on the side where, hopefully, the base beat can't get you.
[0.567480742931366] There was a door between our room and the next one and we felt a little bit uncomfortable, we could hear our neighbours conversations with no effort and they could do the same.
[0.567480742931366] We were given a regular room and when we called to ask to have our room replaced with another Jacuzzi room it took 25 minutes for the front desk to call us back.

[0.56587815284729] I have stayed at this Hilton Garden on Peter street on business many, many times-so when planning a weekend visit with the family I had no hesitation to book- Its well situated, clean and modern and generally a very good value and the Hhnonors perks are good- WOW what a difference during the weekend-instead of business folk and tourists-its packed with club kids and partyers-the staff do their best-but its noisy and the area around the hotel is pretty crazy late in the evening on weekends- I will stay again during the week-but never on a weekend
[0.5664550065994263] At first i thought this was the perfect Hotel for our first trip to Toronto.
