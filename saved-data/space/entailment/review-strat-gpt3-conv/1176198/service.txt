[0.5664550065994263] The service at the hotel was poor, and the staff were unhelpful and unaccommodating.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5674135684967041] Not a bad place for _recreational_ travelers But the desk clerks could not figure out that for business travel, two people might have two reservations to share one room -- not, as the clerks set it up, for one to be the guest of the other (which also means no "HHonors" points for the "guest).
[0.567265510559082] They told us in a very rude tone and with attitude that our credit card had been declined over the last few days and that they had tried it several time so we would have to provide a cash deposit.
[0.5669726133346558] All in all, the hotel never bent backwards to compensate for our time involved making calls, getting key made, needing time off work,and driving back.
[0.5664550065994263] Horrible !
[0.5664550065994263] it doesnt matter if im hilton employee or not , check me in first, make me feel welcome and then when i leave the front desk , call to check the level of my honesty , and if im not hilton employee , all you have to do is switch rate and give me call to let me know !!!

[0.562936544418335] The service manager refused!
[0.5645416378974915] After swiping your card then you are questioned by someone about which room you are going to.
[0.5645416378974915] and that after 10 minutes they were going to come up into our room to check if our guest was still there??!!
[0.5645416378974915] Also, the staff for some reason couldn't seem to do the sums right!
[0.5655012130737305] First, there was absolutely no housecleaning/maid service!
