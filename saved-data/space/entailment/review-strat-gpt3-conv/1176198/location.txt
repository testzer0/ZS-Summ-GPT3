----- Supporting -----

[0.5687429904937744] Say what you liked best & least - The best part in my opinion was the view of the CN Tower, but not every room will have that - other than that it would have to be the room size and beds.
[0.5676996111869812] Breakfast was served in the associated restaurant (but inside the hotel) and was very good (although the yellow cheese slices we had on the first day have disappeared for the next 3 days).
[0.5674216747283936] Loved the area around this hotel, we had stayed around the Dundas area the previous week and this was much better.

[0.5627989768981934] The second floor restaurant area was lovely and the service at breakfast could not have been better.
[0.562936544418335] The rooms are equal to anything Hilton offers, the fitness facility is first rate and the restaurant staff are friendly and attentive - to the right degree.
[0.562936544418335] My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn over the July-August long weekend and had a great time!
[0.5631439089775085] From the airport got a car that seated 5 people and luggage and cost $65 which we didn't think was too bad - took about 25 minutes.

[0.5664550065994263] The reviewers said that the location was not that great because it was hard to find a parking spot and the staff was not very helpful.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5678685903549194] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!
[0.5667135715484619] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended

[0.5664550065994263] There are lots of parking lots near by that look cheaper than the hotel valet system (one right across the road).

**********

[0.5664550065994263] The location is good for some attractions, but it is not the nicest area of town and it is next to a noisy nightclub.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5678685903549194] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.5678484439849854] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.5670517683029175] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.
[0.5664550065994263] Great location and a short walk to much of Toronto's sights.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5631815791130066] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.5638695955276489] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
[0.5664550065994263] It is not that hard to match up numbers on tickets to find a vehicle.
