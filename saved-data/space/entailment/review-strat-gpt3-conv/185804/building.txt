[0.567480742931366] The reviewers thought that the building was old and not well-maintained.

----- Supporting -----

[0.567480742931366] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.5664550065994263] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
[0.5664550065994263] Nothing a little renovation couldn't quickly take care of.
[0.5664550065994263] We went to the Pacific Culinary Institute and that was amazing!
[0.5664550065994263] I'd have given it 5 stars if only the desk chair hadn't had arms and been a royal pain to move around.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5631773471832275] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[0.5648515224456787] While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
[0.5648808479309082] Bad Points * half renovated the common areas are nice, the bathrooms have no bath tubs but new bathrooms.
[0.5654236674308777] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[0.5664550065994263] He was very impressed and requested a tour of the brewery, which the brew-master provided for him.

[0.5664550065994263] They also thought that it was too small for a family of four and that the elevator was scary.
