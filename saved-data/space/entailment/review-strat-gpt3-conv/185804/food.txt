[0.5645416378974915] For old times sake, we even had lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory, but the food wasn't very good, so we decided to give the city a miss and pootle around the Island instead .
[0.5645416378974915] The food is acceptable, but don't expect gourmet.
[0.5648515224456787] Water Taxi's and walking paths are right there if you want to head out to English Bay or Yaletown.
[0.5648515224456787] The two water taxis companies serving Granville Island make it very accessible to downtown as well.

[0.567142128944397] I probably wouldn't eat there though if I was paying for it myself as the menu was pretty expensive and there are several great places to eat elsewhere on the Island.
