[0.5664550065994263] The reviewers found the rooms to be small and outdated, with no carpeting on the floors.

----- Supporting -----

[0.567480742931366] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[0.567480742931366] The room was small and dark and old.
[0.56746506690979] The marble tile floors in the rooms make for easy management of the pet-friendly policy, so I don't mark this hotel down for that as some other reviewers have mentioned.
[0.5664550065994263] we have a superior room but the view and location can't be beat.
[0.5664550065994263] 3 balconies.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5646503567695618] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[0.5648515224456787] We enjoyed a good lunch.
[0.5648515224456787] And then we wandered around the shops of Granville Island.
[0.565058708190918] Informed then at the desk on my return.
[0.5655757188796997] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.

[0.5664550065994263] Big clean remodelled bathroom.
[0.5664550065994263] My 8 year old could throw a rock into the water from our room but might hit one of the dozens of boats bobbing outside our window.

[0.5641714930534363] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.
[0.5664550065994263] We enjoyed a quick, one-night visit to Vancouver, and stayed at the Granville Island Hotel.
[0.5664550065994263] To get there, we took the quick little ferry from downtown, and walked with our rolling suitcases to the hotel, conveniently located and yet away from any traffic.
[0.5664550065994263] It's a calm, well-designed "boutique" hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island.
[0.5664550065994263] Those small issues aside, this is a lovely hotel in a great area, close to the attractions of Vancouver yet far enough away to provide solace.

[0.5664550065994263] There were also not enough outlets and the desk staff were not very friendly.

[0.5664550065994263] However, the location of the hotel was praised.

[0.5687586665153503] Living in the 'burbs' of Vancouver, my wife and I enjoy staying at the Granville Island Hotel as our home away from home.
[0.5687586665153503] After studying tripadvisor for some time we decided to make the best of our single-night stay in Vancouver by booking the Granville Island Hotel and we were not let down.
[0.5687246918678284] Staying at the Grandville Island hotel always makes my stay in Vancouver a special experience.
[0.5684059262275696] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[0.5683280229568481] We had a superior room over looking the patio restaurant and False Creek.

----- Weakening -----

[0.562936544418335] The staff were very apologetic about the fire that had temporarily closed the restaurant, but when we saw our room, we forgot all about food.
[0.5630761981010437] We had breakfast each morning at Granville Island which is always pleasant (earlier in the day the better when its not busy.)
[0.5631701946258545] However the hotel is very nice, and the staff very helpful.
[0.5632978081703186] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
[0.5633679032325745] I've stayed in all types, all ratings of hotels around the world and I rank Granville Island Hotel as one of my top picks due to the location and relaxed environment... especially for an adult getaway.

**********

[0.5664550065994263] The rooms at the hotel are average or small in size, and some guests felt that the furniture in the rooms was too sparse or dated.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5684549808502197] Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc.
[0.567480742931366] They need to update the place, but since it is the only hotel on Granville Island I think they are in no rush!
[0.567480742931366] The rooms are small and sparsely furnished.
[0.567480742931366] Those small issues aside, this is a lovely hotel in a great area, close to the attractions of Vancouver yet far enough away to provide solace.
[0.56746506690979] As I said the rooms are too small for all that furniture.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5639642477035522] We had wished the room had a fridge that could be used rather than one stocked with liquor.
[0.5639642477035522] Its a bit old and some of the furnishings and fabrics in the room showed their age, but its clean and quiet and the mattress was comfortable.
[0.5648515224456787] I love the lounge and the micro brew beer!
[0.5648515224456787] I also recommend the huevos rancheros for breakfast.
[0.5648515224456787] It was OK for this purpose.

[0.5664550065994263] There were also some complaints about the quality of the fittings in the rooms, such as the shower fixtures.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5642427206039429] Like the wonky shower head.
[0.5643305778503418] The shower fixture although very smart looking are hard to use and are very sharp due to the sharp and clean lines of design.

[0.5684388279914856] Informed then at the desk on my return.
[0.5684388279914856] First, I need to mention how helpful the folks at the front desk were.
[0.5684388279914856] They put new fresh flowers in the room every few days.
[0.5682205557823181] And what kind of hotel charges for local calls?!
[0.5681761503219604] Thank you so much...I can't wait to go back!

----- Weakening -----

[0.5625231266021729] And the hotel is a $10 cab ride from downtown or you can take a water taxi to the edge of the downtown area.
[0.5634939074516296] I accepted 211 but should have negotiated for a different room.
[0.5636139512062073] And then we wandered around the shops of Granville Island.
[0.5640000700950623] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!
[0.5643813610076904] However, we really wanted a room on the 2nd floor with a view over False creek, so changed on night 2.

**********

[0.5664550065994263] The rooms are clean and comfortable, with good views.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5685844421386719] Our room was on the ground floor, and I was initially worried it might be noisy as it had a view of the waiter's water station for the outside patio, but in fact it was very quiet, and we could glimpse the water through the shrubs which preserved our privacy, as well as people-watching.
[0.568117082118988] The hotel was well appointed, our room comfortable and decorated in a traditional style.
[0.5679854154586792] I wish that there were a way to turn off the outside lights, however, so that I could leave the curtains open at night to catch the lights from the buildings across False Creek.
[0.5679354071617126] I had a room with a partial view and it was very nice.
[0.5679341554641724] I recommend room 326… vaulted ceiling with cedar beams, king bed, wet bar and a fantastic water view… at a standard room price.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5627351999282837] Secondly, the room was well equipped, the decor tasteful and the bed was extremely comfortable.
[0.5627394318580627] Very peacful at night and sitting by the fire in the bar prior to dinner was so relaxing.
[0.5627480149269104] It had views of the harbour and the rooms were absolutely beautiful -- nice marble floors too.
[0.5632569193840027] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.

[0.567480742931366] My 8 year old could throw a rock into the water from our room but might hit one of the dozens of boats bobbing outside our window.
[0.567480742931366] We also stayed at the Slyvia Hotel in the West end, next door to Stanley Park, and that was much better value, both in regard to location, and space.
[0.567480742931366] The room was the smallest we stayed in during our tour of western Canada, and it was a struggle to fit in a rollaway bed for my son.
[0.567480742931366] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.

[0.5631439089775085] We arrived from the UK tired and, hungry, and dirty, and found to our delight that we had been upgraded to a penthouse suite.
[0.5637378096580505] The end room is great because even though it's small, 2 walls are window-sliders to balconies overlooking ritzy boats and water traffic.
[0.5645416378974915] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
