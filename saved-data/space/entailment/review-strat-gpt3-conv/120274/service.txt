[0.5664550065994263] The reviews said that the service was poor, with the staff being unhelpful and rude.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5676043629646301] The hotel refused to match multiple lower rates I had found elsewhere, so I decided to cancel due to unhelpful reservation services and reserve a hotel I KNOW has superior customer service.
[0.567480742931366] After the sherrif arrived nobody even made it to our room to check on us or offer a different room.
[0.567480742931366] Landscaping was terrible,elevators were dirty and anywhere outside of the room was not well maintained.
[0.567480742931366] The front desk refused to let us see her stating that the shuttle is not the manager's responsibility.
[0.567480742931366] First, the shuttle service they offered took us to the wrong theme park 40 minutes late without any explanation.

[0.5664550065994263] Also, they hit you up with some kind of $1.86 a night fee tacked onto your bill...surprise!

[0.5664550065994263] The reviews for this hotel were mostly negative, with guests citing issues with hidden fees, poor communication from staff, and an inconvenient shuttle schedule.

----- Supporting -----

[0.567480742931366] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
