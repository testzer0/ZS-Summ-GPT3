[0.5664550065994263] Give it a miss though if you are a hygiene freak, or if you expect to spend time at poolside or hanging out in the hotel!
[0.5664550065994263] To sum up, ok accomodation if you only want somewhere reasonably clean to sleep (and the free breakfast is a good cost saver).
[0.5664550065994263] However if the slightest sign of dirt or grime gives you cause to reach for the phone and call reception, I would pass on this hotel for 2 reasons.
[0.5664550065994263] We were too scared to go on the hulk ride, please don't share the same regrets.
