----- Supporting -----

[0.5688941478729248] First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.

**********

[0.5664550065994263] Many reviewers also noted an unpleasant odor in the rooms.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5676043629646301] We were booked at the hotel as part of a package deal so had no choice on where we were staying and from reading the previous reviews were quite worried but we certainly didn't encounter any issues with vermin in the rooms.
[0.5665867328643799] It was just kind of old/dated & grimy!
[0.5664550065994263] It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!
[0.5664550065994263] You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.
[0.5664550065994263] The less said about the pool though the better.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5621322989463806] Many other reviews suggest that rooms smell of damp, I did not experience this but it wouldn't surprise me as Florida has a sub tropical climate with very high levels of humidity.
[0.562936544418335] The rooms are VERY outdated, smell terribly and don't even consider a room on the ground floor.
[0.5639095306396484] However, it was all pretty lived-in and tired in truth (and yes, as others have mentioned, the room did smell damp).
[0.5645416378974915] Our toilet never flushed properly and the washrooms were dirty.

[0.5664550065994263] This hotel provides you with what you would expect for the price, and the cleanliness of our room gave us no real concerns.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5664550065994263] This was our 5th visit to Orlando and our first budget trip and i have to say that this little gem of a hotel is far superior to other more expensive ones in the area.

[0.5664550065994263] The pool was a good size, very clean and looked out onto the lake.
[0.5664550065994263] I would highly recommend a trip to the Rainforest Cafe in Downtown Disney, Hardrock Cafe in Universal, Bennigans on I drive and Johnny Rockets at the Pointe they are all brilliant!!
[0.5664550065994263] Without a doubt I'd return to this hotel, it's superb value for money.

**********

[0.5664550065994263] The rooms were clean, but basic and old.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5686838626861572] The room was good, but on checking in it was obvious that someone had used the room after it was cleaned - some cookiecrumbs and an empty sodabottle were left behind.
[0.5683526992797852] There was plently of parking and the first room they put us in was clean and tidy, however a bit dark.
[0.5677725076675415] Room very basic with some odor (I think due to rooms shut all day not getting aired) twin beds, tv, safe, coffe maker, ironing board/iron, hair dryer, table and chairs, small dressing area, bath with shower.
[0.5676729679107666] The bathroom was clean but again old - towels and other laundry were acceptable.
[0.5675420165061951] The room wasn't really that bad we were on the smoking floor (3rd floor) it was just very basic with a very small bathroom, there were always little ants around the sink area but no matter how many you washed away double the amount would come back.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5620285868644714] Pool area cleaned daily again basic could do with some new furniture have to cross small parking lot to access, towels available daily from reception minimal charge.

[0.5664550065994263] The continental breakfast was a joke, and the breakfast lines were out of sight.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5684388279914856] We left the next day after a nightmare night and overcrowded non eatable breakfast that you had to stay in line for half an hour.
[0.5675824880599976] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.
[0.567480742931366] Our ice machine was broken...beyond all that, though, we got a non-smoking room 2 miles from the Disney Main Gate for about $30 a night.
[0.567480742931366] No Danish, no fruit...nil, nada, nothing.
[0.5673651695251465] Complimentary breakfast was mediocre, I'd rather go to some nearby restaurant's breakfast buffets for $4++/person.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5624659657478333] The motels website states that fridges are in the room, but there was not one to be seen.
[0.5631439089775085] It was very crowded and they basically had toast and cereal.
[0.5643109679222107] I thought the included breakfast is indicative of poor American eating habits - just a bundh of donuts and not a piece of fruit in sight.
[0.5645416378974915] I was disappointed that there was no breakfast, eventhough it was just toast & cereal it was a bonus, but there are many places to eat nearby.
[0.5645416378974915] The "free continental breakfast " looked a joke.
