[0.5112545490264893] The reviews said that the cleanliness of the hotel was average.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5112545490264893] The only aspect of the hotel that could be improved, in my opinion, is the fitness center -- it's in the basement and has older equipment.
[0.5039321780204773] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
[0.5028046369552612] Great pricing compared to other hotels near by.
[0.46514302492141724] It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.
[0.45892709493637085] My companion and I stayed at this hotel because it was one of the most affordable on the day we went.

----- Supporting -----

[0.49038583040237427] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[0.47413936257362366] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
[0.43733707070350647] The only thing I didn't care for was the fitness center, which was sort of a dungeon in the basement.
[0.43394267559051514] I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.
[0.4090571105480194] The A/C, no matter how low it was set, didn't keep the room very cool.

[0.5585356950759888] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.5468782782554626] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.

[0.5107234716415405] I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.
[0.48998358845710754] Now, a few drawbacks - the hotel charges $9.95/day for wifi, does any other motel/hotel anywhere do that anymore?
