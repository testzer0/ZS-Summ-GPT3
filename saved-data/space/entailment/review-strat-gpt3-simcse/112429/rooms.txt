[0.6079373359680176] The rooms are suspect for making people ill.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6079373359680176] I cannot say for sure that it was due to the room but it is highly suspect.
[0.5800037980079651] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[0.5779846906661987] Other rooms might not have this problem.
[0.5697992444038391] The halls had a very odd smell, like a dental office.
[0.5658517479896545] The room is shabby, the shower made a horrible noise whenever the water was running.
