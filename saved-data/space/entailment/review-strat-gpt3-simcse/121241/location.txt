[0.4903082251548767] The reviewers found the Stone Castle to be unappealing and a poor value compared to other hotels in the area.

[0.4903082251548767] It was a very dissapointing place to stay ~ NEVER again
[0.47782227396965027] This was by far the worst place I have ever attempted to stay!
[0.4208493232727051] At 11pm I contacted the Holiday Inn Express on Green Mountian Drive and Josh gave me a great rate to help compensate the poor quality of the Stone Castle.
[0.40020620822906494] The entire place looked dark, dingy and medieval so they're keeping with the whole castle theme, very dungeon-like.
[0.3903234601020813] We did not enjoy this vacation at all, and it was a total waste of time and money to stay here.
