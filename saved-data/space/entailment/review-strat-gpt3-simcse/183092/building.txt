[0.6285503506660461] The reviewers thought that the building was in need of refurbishment.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6285503506660461] Think it's in real need of refurbishment.
[0.5608024597167969] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[0.5447803139686584] The lobby refurb looked great -- now they just need to tackle some of the older rooms.
[0.383014440536499] The lobby was modern with a beautiful fireplace and a good breafast/coffee/drinks bar too.

[0.03612731024622917] Under that mall is the subway station, so you can actually get on the subway without ever going outside.
[0.036348726600408554] Bonus, no need to go out with a coat since the Marriott has indoor access to the Eaton Center...Shoppers Heaven for sure!!!
[0.04246721416711807] Its a pretty cool thing to be able to walk right into torontos biggest mall in just two minutes.
[0.05420766770839691] Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.
[0.09007548540830612] The mall can be accessed through the hotel without going outside.

[0.030329084023833275] Kensington Market and the Brewery District were the longest shlepps and those walks might not be for all, but we really enjoyed them and had fun detouring through the nearby neighborhoods.

[0.7133866548538208] The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated, but there is only one elevator to the parking garage, which can cause long wait times.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7133866548538208] They also really need more than 1 elevator to the parking garage.

[0.6142672300338745] There have also been false fire alarms, which are disconcerting.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6142672300338745] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
[0.5275492668151855] Had some idiot pull fire alarm at 4 am on Sunday, but was resolved within 30 minutes and not having to evacuate.
[0.4987702965736389] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[0.46852901577949524] Only downside was at 2am someone decided to light a cigarette in a stairwell and set off the smoke alarm causing all of the hotel guests to be evacuated.
[0.44701868295669556] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!

[0.6755441427230835] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!
[0.6657695770263672] Everything was as expected, good check in, great location, nice room, good staff, etc....then about 11:00pm the fire alarms went off.
