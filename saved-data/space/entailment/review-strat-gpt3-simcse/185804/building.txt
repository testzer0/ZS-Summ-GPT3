[0.48199403285980225] The reviewers thought that the building was old and not well-maintained.

----- Supporting -----

[0.48199403285980225] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[0.47177138924598694] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[0.45173919200897217] Bad Points * half renovated the common areas are nice, the bathrooms have no bath tubs but new bathrooms.
[0.40410733222961426] The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.
[0.33625930547714233] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
