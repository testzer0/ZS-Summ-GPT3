[0.7618199586868286] My experience at this hotel was the worst I've ever experience within the service industry.
[0.7617083787918091] It is obvious that Customer Service is not a priority for this hotel.
[0.6780451536178589] Don't stay at this hotel unless you like slow (and possibly unsafe) elevators, flaky wireless Internet, and poor customer service.
[0.6130191087722778] The staff were rude and quite useless, they just seemed annoyed and unwilling to help no matter how polite we were.
[0.5958243608474731] One front desk was outright rude and unhelpful for several requests which had to be handled by a morning person who was confused why the evening staff wouldn't help me until I told her the staff name and she rolled her eyes and suggested I speak with management.

[0.5759541988372803] When I complained about the elevators and wireless he just stood there with no apology or good explanation other than it would be too expensive to fix the elevators and it was all the guests' fault anyway for the elevator getting stuck since there were 8 people in the elevator (it's rated for 12 people).

[0.4186728596687317] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
