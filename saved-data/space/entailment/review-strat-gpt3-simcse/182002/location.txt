[0.7060900926589966] According to the reviews, the hotel is located in a decent area, but the parking situation is not ideal.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7060900926589966] The hotel itself is in a good location.
[0.6565064191818237] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.6340783834457397] It is handy to shopping and night life â€“ but so are many other hotels from which to choose.
[0.6137664318084717] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.6116971969604492] If you are staying here be warned about the parking though.

[0.5070732831954956] If you are staying here be warned about the parking though.
[0.470283567905426] I couldn't believe they were trying to stick me for a charge when I hadn't been able to park in the garage, the spot was supposed to be free, the spot was recommended by the hotel staff, AND my car was broken into while parked there.
[0.43567323684692383] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
[0.43231144547462463] The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.
[0.4265027642250061] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.

[0.004878707230091095] We mentioned on check in that it was our anniversary and were immediately upgraded from our room with 1 double to a king room on the highest floor with a wonderful view of the city.
[0.014553776010870934] The best thing about the room was its view.
[0.020015068352222443] I didn't eat at the restaurant, so can't comment on that.
[0.023686477914452553] The restaurant was also a great deal since our kids ate free from the buffet since they are younger.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8174517154693604] The underground parking is horribly laid out.
[0.6516910791397095] Its really tight down there, but there is also a public lot outside which you can use.
