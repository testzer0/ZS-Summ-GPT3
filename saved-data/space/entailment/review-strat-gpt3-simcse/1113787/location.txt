[0.6130290627479553] The reviewers said that the location was not good because there was no view and the ice machines did not work.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6130290627479553] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.5193443298339844] The only downside was that I was there in January, and the Poule was not open.
[0.474051833152771] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
[0.44457221031188965] This hotel does not have ice machines you have to call for ice well we called so we could have our own drink in room well lets say it NEVER CAME!!!!
[0.4402087330818176] Trip to this hotel started off VERY poorly with a bungled reservation.

[0.4167529344558716] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[0.3895323574542999] At first, I did not want to eat at the restaurant.

[0.5858116149902344] The location of the hotel was not ideal, as it was located near a loading dock where trucks came and went.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5858116149902344] It is clear this hotel has no loading dock or alley because while I was eating dinner at the award winning restaurant downstairs (Charlie Palmer's) I had big trucks pulling up within 10 ft of my table loading and unloading big crates of towels (I learned they outsource their linens) and other large pieces of equipment.
