[0.6648558378219604] The reviews said that the rooms were adequate but overpriced, and that the view from the room was not great.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6648558378219604] All in all, this hotel was nothing special with a high price tag.
[0.6473625302314758] This hotel would have been adequate if the room price was much less.
[0.6178661584854126] Although the room we were in was a bit small, they had really nice decor and details that you would not see a Marriott or a Hilton, IMHO.
[0.5885487794876099] The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars (if I could it would be 4.75) on "Service" is b/c they weren't so timely on pre-arranged room service...we asked for it by a certain time and it arrived about a half hour later.
[0.5873382687568665] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.

[0.002512271050363779] We had an amazing time celebrating our daughter's 13TH birthday at the Joule in Dallas....from the time we were greeted until the time we checked out, we were made to feel special and welcomed.

[0.8256168365478516] They also said that the gym was in need of an upgrade.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8256168365478516] The gym is in desperate need of an upgrade.
[0.47311925888061523] The gym is okay, but somewhat small.
[0.39684605598449707] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.3873775899410248] I was pleased to find out it is actually a better hotel overall and sad I didn't discover this sooner.
[0.3695048987865448] Brand new hotel which is nice since so many hotels do not update once they are a little older.

[0.6780575513839722] The rooms at the Joule are tiny and lack customer service.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6780575513839722] 2 - We stayed in the Demi-Joule room and it was very small.
[0.6232388615608215] The Joule is not luxurious in comparison and not sure why Starwood has it branded as such.
[0.6230716705322266] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.

[-0.014296507462859154] They have a special lunch that includes a soup, salad and half sandwich that's quick and inexpensive.

[0.7495388388633728] However, the bathrooms lacked privacy.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7495388388633728] The rooms are awesome except for the lack of privacy in the toilets that others have mentioned.
[0.6753972768783569] I wasn't crazy about the way the bathroom is a bit open to the room.
[0.5639562606811523] other than that the bathroom is not very private so if you want to preserve the "romance" factor you'll need to make a trip to the lobby because the ballroom level restroom is kept locked.
[0.5484799146652222] The bath and toilet were divided into two separate rooms, and the sink area was separate.
[0.5299882888793945] Having said at, the bathroom was big, and really nice.

[-0.022196486592292786] My only real negative was that I'm an avid swimmer and the pool was closed for a private party from approx 6 pm until 10 the evening of our stay.
[-0.018780505284667015] It is one of a kind and nothing else can compare in Dallas or wherever you may be....
