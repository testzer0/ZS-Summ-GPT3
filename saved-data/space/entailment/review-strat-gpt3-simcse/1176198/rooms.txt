[0.6180007457733154] The guests felt that the rooms were dirty and noisy, and that the hotel did not do a good job of accommodating their requests.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6180007457733154] Pros: room very clean and well-lit; staff extremely helpful; extra comfortable beds (probably one of the best hotel beds I've slept in) Cons: room internet was very slow except for very basic email checks; breakfast room was understaffed so that two frantic staff-members were running around looking very flustered and struggling to deal with all the guests
[0.5868178009986877] The room was great, the only issues we had was with Valet parking and having a room at the front of the hotel.
[0.5823059678077698] overall the people were nice but because of the uncomfortable bed we would not stay here again.
[0.5735298991203308] My only complaint is that I booked 5 rooms but when I checked in they had spread all the rooms across one floor and we all wanted the rooms side by side with some adjoining.
[0.5643053650856018] My boyfriend and I stayed here this past weekend january 21-23 and the people were nice not that we were in the hotel to much other than to sleep but the bed was absolutely awful it was like sleeping on a board.

[0.6815133094787598] Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.

[0.6496348977088928] Room was very comfortable, good location for sightseeing in Toronto, breakfasts cooked to order, and all went well until the third night when the nightclub next door went into action.
