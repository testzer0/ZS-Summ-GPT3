[0.7268837094306946] The first review said that the location was not as close as the rental agency said it would be, and that the reviewer's back got worse as a result.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7268837094306946] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[0.5001890063285828] There was a slight mix up with our booking but no fuss was made although I did find the reception staff a little disinterested but nothing to spoil my stay.
[0.4894453287124634] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended
[0.4441957175731659] The palaver with the change in the restaurant was the only niggle and although it was a little comical, I can imagine it would become very irritating if it happened more than once.
[0.43610674142837524] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.

[-0.05526573210954666] Smack in the middle of Toronto entertainment district with the Rogers Dome and CN Tower just down the street!
[-0.04889707267284393] It's right in the middle of the entertainment district which means you are near everything.
[-0.045010484755039215] You can pretty much walk everywhere in downtown.
[-0.040047794580459595] The 15-minute walk to Union Station is very easy and convenient.
[-0.03171062096953392] Great location for CN Tower/Blue Jays with plenty of local bars and restaurants, and easy access to tramcars.

[0.637413501739502] The reviewers said that the location was not that great because it was hard to find a parking spot and the staff was not very helpful.

[0.5711292624473572] I would avoid the restaurant in the hotel as the service is slow and inconsistent.
[0.5503858327865601] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.

[0.8192352652549744] The location is good for some attractions, but it is not the nicest area of town and it is next to a noisy nightclub.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8192352652549744] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.
[0.7590166330337524] Other Comments: the location is not too far from some great downtown clubs.
[0.694880485534668] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.6575467586517334] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.

[0.7405316233634949] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.
[0.7162505388259888] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.
