[0.585196852684021] the hotel is in a good area and is very close to eaton centre and many other attractions.

----- Supporting -----

[0.585196852684021] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[0.5502423644065857] There were lots of restaurants around, and found the area and city in general to be very family friendly.
[0.5258558988571167] Nice lobby.
[0.48045480251312256] Tim Hortons right in the lobby which was very convenient.
[0.44072479009628296] It appears this hotel also serves as a university residence, but there was no noise issue with that.

[-0.0741010457277298] Only small issue was when I went to iron my pants the iron was broken.
[-0.06620673835277557] It wasn't obvious and I only noticed it because I was accessing a wall plug behind the bedside table.
[-0.03319614380598068] We waited 25 minutes for a car to move and had to find management to clear it so we could proceed!
[-0.022805284708738327] It was quickley rectified and someone brought me a new iron within minuets.
[-0.021819153800606728] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.

[0.5315593481063843] the room was very comfortable and the staff were very helpful and helpful.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5315593481063843] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!
[0.5194846391677856] The beds were comfortable and the sheets good quality but the furniture is pretty dated and the bathroom very tired looking.
[0.49589067697525024] They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting.
[0.4858834743499756] I saw some work being done in the lobby and wonder if they also did the rooms as our furniture looked to be new and had no damage or wear you normally see.
[0.4668232202529907] Nice lobby.

[-0.04908742010593414] Several churches of different denominations are dotted around Allan Park that is across the street.
[0.008465793915092945] (Coming off the street, the turns were tight and narrow.)
[0.011971969157457352] We were lost in a city we HAD never been in for 10 mintues during the night.
[0.022585220634937286] the subway is just up the street .
[0.030518684536218643] You have to drive very slow and carefully to make sure you don't damage your car.
