[0.689765214920044] You don't generally go wrong with a Hilton.
[0.6772488355636597] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.
