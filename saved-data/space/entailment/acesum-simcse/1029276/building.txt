[0.40139663219451904] Beautiful lobby!
[0.34047752618789673] Hotel could do with a refurbishment.
[0.33699125051498413] Ä±t has an interesting entrance you take a lift to 3 floor above to enter the lobby from the valet service but still not tiring.
[0.33607685565948486] When we finally got to the lobby (because it's a little bit tricky) it was full of people checking in, but everything ran just perfect thanks to the professionalism and friendly attitude of the front desk agents.

[0.29705023765563965] We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier.
[0.28819483518600464] Ended up riding up and back down to get to the lobby.

[0.09822408854961395] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.11894147098064423] And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor.

[0.15785610675811768] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
