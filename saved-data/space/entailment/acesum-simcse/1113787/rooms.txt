[-0.06357619911432266] (Not Four Seasons, Not Zaza, Not The Crescent) Get my point?
[-0.01793263480067253] It might be where the young people of Texas go to spend their money on dinner and drinks in the bar but its not the place to stay overnight.

[-0.16652095317840576] They finally were ok with the outside food once they realized we were NOT moving it and were still quite unhappy about the pool situation.
[-0.03131549805402756] AND the pool was closed for a "photo shoot" that took up the whole pool for a majority of the afternoon.
[-0.008156952448189259] The pool was too chilly for the kids to spend much time in it, but that isn't surprising for this time of year.
[0.010940426960587502] Well the fact that 3 days later I was wishing I was there again should answer the question.
[0.015115930698812008] The management opened the pool later (10-midnight) so we decided to try it then.

[0.3345533013343811] All in all, this hotel was nothing special with a high price tag.
[0.307528555393219] Charlie Palmer cooks the room service menu but it is different menu than restaurant and didn't look as good (no foie gras).
[0.27575981616973877] Maybe I just had a bad experience but I was throughly disappointed in this hotel.
[0.2586701512336731] Dinner at Charlie Palmer's was simply superb!
[0.25812917947769165] (Apparently we weren't the only guests to have their evening botched by this hotel).
