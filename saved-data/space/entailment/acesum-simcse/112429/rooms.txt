[-0.017415214329957962] All in all I would probably stay somewhere else next time, but wouldn't discourage anyone from selecting this place either.
[0.011712513864040375] Overall, I would suggest this to anyone going to Seattle needing to be near all the action!

[0.5811432600021362] My room was nice enough, but faced the Hyatt and so was a little dark with little natural light.
[0.42179763317108154] Definitely needed the curtains open by day.
[0.41365107893943787] The hallway to our room smelled of cleaning or toiletry products (we couldn't tell which).
[0.3962405025959015] I was put in a room that just didn't have the feeling be being fresh and clean.
[0.39388740062713623] Beds comfortable but the windows seemed to have drafty gaps and the air conditioning unit on it let in outside air and sound as if it was an open window.

[-0.1619184911251068] I will be very happy to stay at this hotel each time I return to Seattle, especially if I can get the great rate I paid by calling the hotel directly to book in advance.
[-0.11855410039424896] Everything from the staff to the amenities everything.
[-0.11732183396816254] I would definitely choose this hotel again, especially if they are offering the parking promotion again.
[-0.10358065366744995] The Dragonfish Cafe in the hotel is simply awesome.
[-0.10082297027111053] we've stayed all over seattle, and this newer hotel is a great buy, request corner room for bigger one, and join the hotels' guest program, coast hotels to get free upgrades
