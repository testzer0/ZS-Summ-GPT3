[0.442782461643219] The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the decor in good taste (lots of texture, neutral tone, and rich burgandy to soothe the spirit).
[0.4296581447124481] The decor was cool and modern.
[0.4150044620037079] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.
[0.38478463888168335] I notified the front desk to make sure it was cleaned at some point.
[0.37073901295661926] My room was warm and I discovered the fan was on, but the A/C was not.

[-0.04776850715279579] Pikes Market was 4 blocks away.
[-0.0451415590941906] Wi-fi, however, was spotty in strength, and I frequently had difficulty maintaining a connection.
[-0.01954096183180809] Now, a few drawbacks - the hotel charges $9.95/day for wifi, does any other motel/hotel anywhere do that anymore?
[0.013748404569923878] The night before I needed to leave there was a big snowstorm in town, and I was worried the rail system would not be running the next morning.
[0.01447407528758049] Free wi-fi.

[0.43828245997428894] the staff was friendly and helpful.

[0.43828245997428894] The concierge was more than polite as he parked our car which was included in our package.
[0.38511574268341064] I notified the front desk to make sure it was cleaned at some point.
[0.37578439712524414] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
[0.341614693403244] We asked for more towels and they arrived within minutes.
[0.3381918668746948] The valet man was excellent.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.07240208983421326] There is a coffee maker and an empty refrigerator.
[-0.07183653116226196] Not counting the missing kettle!
[-0.021591048687696457] There is no complimentary anything.
[-0.0187608040869236] I don't like the shampoo and conditioner dispenser attached to the wall in the shower though.
[-0.009537206962704659] Monorail super close.
