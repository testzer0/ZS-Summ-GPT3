[-0.07533856481313705] Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative.
[-0.05748749524354935] There are also a lot of gift shops, miniature golfs etc, so there's plenty to keep everyone amused.
[-0.054519981145858765] You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.
[-0.04140818119049072] There are numerous restaurants around including a Dunkin Donuts.
[-0.03988751769065857] There are dolphins swimming only few yards from the people but be careful because there are also sharks.

[0.4982452094554901] have stayed here many times now, an never have we complained once about anything because the rooms were great this year we even had a 4 ring hob, microwave, fridge, the room was kept so clean , clean sheets when ever we wanted towels clean every day the supervisor spoke to us every day asked if we needed anything had a smile every day we were there, how can you moan about this hotel its perfect, close to all the food outlets walgreens opposite you can walk to all the shops, what is there to moan about, if you want 5 star then go and stay in 5 star pay 5 star money bet you will moan then?
[0.4973723888397217] I am an early riser(6.30 to 7am) and so I had the breakfast area to myself but did get much busy later on.I found all staff to be very helpfull There are a few restaurants and fast food places within walking distance and a Walgreens not far away There is a shuttle bus to Epcot (you need to use Disney Transport to get to other parks) it leaves at 8.45am and about 1pm.

[0.632341742515564] I'm pretty sure they gave us this hotel so we can compare the 5 star accomadation to this dirty location.
[0.5691591501235962] I would highly suggest spending more money to stay at a Disney property or a more expensive hotel.
[0.5593996644020081] This is a 2 STAR MOTEL Some Guests Expect All The Extras of a 4 STAR HOTEL If so Then do not STAY HERE This is perfect for the HARD DAY At the PARKS.WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT.
[0.5093773007392883] All in all, most of the hotels/motels are much the same unless you are staying on Disney property, but then again you are paying for the name.
[0.4887637794017792] This was a nice place to stay for the money.

[-0.027651257812976837] Free breakfast - granted area was small but then there is a 3 hour window i.e.
