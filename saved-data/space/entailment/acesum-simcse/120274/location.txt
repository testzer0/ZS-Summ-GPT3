[-0.04660230875015259] Firstly, reception won't really care as we found them quite surely and unhelpful, and secondly the rooms are not gleaming and smelling of rose petals!
[-0.04575921967625618] We booked through First Choice and they really should not be selling this place to customers.
[0.012104973196983337] It wasn't a problem though, and I didn't even report it to reception.
[0.01254897378385067] Please note, although I booked online directly through the companyâ€™s website, I have been informed that it was a third party transaction and they WILL NOT cancel my reservation without the confirmation number which i do not have, yet they can see my reservation in front of them.
