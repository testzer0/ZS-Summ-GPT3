[0.61402428150177] The Hotel does provide free shuttle buses to Sea world, Universal/Islands of Adventure & to the Epcot Centre (transfer by Monorail at Epcot for the other Disney parks).
[0.49570244550704956] however this is not the hotels fault but Disney as they put on the transport.
[0.48858657479286194] Hotel does supply free shuttle buses to all theme parks which go every day and you don't have to bye your tickets from the guest services at the front of the hotel happy holidays.
[0.4739534556865692] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....

[-0.1241554245352745] Instead of listening to what we had to say, she continually interuppted us mid-sentence and told us we were wrong.
[-0.11453637480735779] We gave them a second chance.
[-0.10098613798618317] She told us she didn't believe us because we were the only people who have complained about this situation.
