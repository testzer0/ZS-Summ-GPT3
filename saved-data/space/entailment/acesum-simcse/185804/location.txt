[-0.10692201554775238] The temperature control ( an old round dial type of thermostat) didnt work so we couldnt adjust the temperature, other then by opening a window.
[-0.08788934350013733] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[-0.07182104885578156] The service in the restaurant was a bit snobbish and I didn't get the condiments I requested the second morning, however this is minor in my opinion.
[-0.06394992768764496] I didn't eat at the restaurant since I only stayed overnight & was meeting friends elsewhere, so can't comment on that.

[-0.07523016631603241] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.04518101364374161] The only other comment is about the huge trees that are planted directly in front of the million dollar view.
