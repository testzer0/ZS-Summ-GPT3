[-0.13641357421875] There also is not a commuter train stop on Granville Island, so you have to pay for a taxi or water taxi if you don't have a rental car.
[0.011286459863185883] You really are forced to use the ferry boats to get across the creek.
[0.01515089813619852] This is an enjoyable way to reach the city, but gets expensive if there is a group of you as it costs $2.50 each way.

[-0.10018293559551239] However, if problems arise, as they did on our night, do not expect the manage to be of any help.
