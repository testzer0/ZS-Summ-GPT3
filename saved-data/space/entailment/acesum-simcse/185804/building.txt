[0.502555787563324] It was a fun, informative, and flexible way to view the entire city.
[0.3833976089954376] The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.
[0.33364635705947876] You do have a art institute across the road.
[0.32236140966415405] The hotel's lobby was undergoing renovations at the time but it never created any issues with our stay.
[0.2997834086418152] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).

[-0.006157910916954279] We arrived a little late on Xmas day after a troublesome time with the car rental company (Budget did not have a car for me despite having a valid reservation).
[0.040284790098667145] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[0.040604908019304276] I'd have given it 5 stars if only the desk chair hadn't had arms and been a royal pain to move around.
[0.05073249340057373] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
