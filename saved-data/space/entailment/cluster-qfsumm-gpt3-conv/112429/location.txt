[0.5161648988723755] Our aim was to get away for a few days, do some shopping and have a few good meals.
[0.5161648988723755] The hotel was very well positioned to do that being central to all the major downtown stores and Pike Pklace Market.
[0.5161648988723755] The hotel restaurant was no great shakes but it is walking distance to some great eateries.
[0.5161648988723755] The restaurant was always convenient for a quick happy hour and even allowed me to take a drink or a dessert upstairs; the concierge went out to the store to deliver me a Sunday NY Times newspaper.
[0.5161648988723755] Don't take a room on the inside unless you want to be awakened by the garbage trucks at 5am.
