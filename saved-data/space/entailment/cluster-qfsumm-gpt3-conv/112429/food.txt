[0.5164624452590942] The hotel has gone through some renovations which make it look nice, Dragonfish changed their menu a bit but their food is still good.
[0.5161648988723755] I was apprehensive because the price was lower then other hotels in the area but there was no reason to.
[0.5161648988723755] And don't pay more than $129/night for a room, there are better deals out there in the higher price range.
[0.5161648988723755] There was an online special of $129/night, which included valet parking.
[0.5161648988723755] I didn't try it, but it doesn't look appetizing.
