[0.5161648988723755] The building is older but well-maintained, and it is undergoing exterior renovations.

[0.5161648988723755] The man who was working at the front desk looked very gruff and mean, when I would ask something he made me feel like I was putting him out.
[0.5161648988723755] Pine Street is much easier to walk down to the Market than some of the other downtown streets (less incline.)
[0.5161648988723755] The lobby has a nice little living room style waiting area but only takes 10 seconds to get through to the elevators.
[0.5161648988723755] You donâ€™t walk in to a fancy lobby, but you also donâ€™t have to pay for it.
[0.5161648988723755] There is BTW always only one person at front desk, so you can find yourself lining up to get even the simplest things done, like getting a demagnetized card reprogrammed.

[0.4511447548866272] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.
[0.46103277802467346] The hotel was under exterior renovations, but that worked out for me as I was out of my room for most of the day.
[0.49244263768196106] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[0.49244263768196106] Tons of construction in the neighborhood which starts at 6:30 am.
[0.49244263768196106] the lobby is sort of lackluster but the rooms were tasfully updated and very clean.

[0.5161648988723755] There have been some issues with the furniture and elevator, but the lobby is beautiful and the location is great.

[0.5161648988723755] There is a great coffee shop across the street and the stunning Paramount Theater down the block.
[0.5161648988723755] My desk chair was broken and I asked for it to be replaced or fixed.
[0.5161648988723755] Designwise, it could be any hotel in any city.
