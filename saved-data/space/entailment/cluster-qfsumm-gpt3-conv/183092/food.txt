[0.5165376663208008] The meal itself was extremely good, it is well worth your money to have a meal there, you won't be disappointed.
[0.5161648988723755] I wasn't in any particular hurry, but just am not used to waiting for hot water these days.
[0.5161648988723755] And for this we paid fancy hotel restaurant prices - ugh!
[0.5161648988723755] I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.
[0.5161648988723755] Food presentation was fancy, but the food didn't taste very good.

[0.5161648988723755] When my husband's Cesar salad was served with chicken instead of salmon, he had to hunt down the waiter to point out the problem, and the waiter barely seemed to care.
[0.5161648988723755] We are NOT demanding restaurant a patrons, but both the food and the service was poor.

[0.47618648409843445] We had breakfast and lunch at the Parkside restaurant in the hotel, the food was of a very high standard, and children less than three eat free ( it costs $7.95 for children over three for the breakfast buffet).
[0.4779811203479767] Unlike many other hotel breakfasts, this one actually has good food!
[0.4854888916015625] I wasn't in any particular hurry, but just am not used to waiting for hot water these days.

[0.5161648988723755] There are 3 and 4 star hotels just down the street from this one, and half the price.
[0.5161648988723755] It think it may also be the most expensive of all of the Toronto Marriott hotels.
[0.5161648988723755] Concierge lounge nibbles in the evening were a little disappointing, but the staff were friendly (I think this area used to be the old steak house).
[0.5161648988723755] If the price was right, I would go back.
[0.5161648988723755] The prices are way to high for what you get... a room.
