[0.5161648988723755] The valets recommended cheap indoor parking in the office building next door.
[0.5161648988723755] The hop on/hop off bus stop was very close to the hotel and so was the drop off spot for the airport shuttle which was great.
[0.5161648988723755] Lots of stores and restaurants in the area.
[0.5161648988723755] The location couldn't have been better.
[0.5161648988723755] The hotel staff may act like they don't know where it is... but it's on Queen St. For some reason, when we asked about it, they acted like they never heard of it - but it was packed, and they have awesome food!

[0.422743022441864] The location, right next to the Eaton Centre, is ideal and makes it easy to take in all of the traditional tourist sights and access the subway.
[0.4363251030445099] The location of this hotel is excellent â€“ very central and close to public transport, shopping, restaurants, etc.
[0.4539395868778229] The location is perfect, near everything one might need on a business trip and for doing some shopping.
[0.4592624604701996] The location was an excellent one for us because our event was just across the street, but we also walked to dinner on Queen Street, had many shopping choices (itâ€™s connected to the Eaton Centre, or you can meander along funky Queen West) and itâ€™s close to the subway.
[0.4668346345424652] The hotel is wonderfully located to all metro hospitals and when some very important down time is needed the Eaton Center mall is attached so you do not have to worry about the weather or putting on a coat.

[0.5161648988723755] The location canâ€™t be beat, youâ€™re right in the heart of the city, right next to the Eaton Centre and steps away from the hive of Dundas Square.

[0.49244263768196106] Parking expensive but what isn't in Toronto?
[0.5161648988723755] It is adjacent to the Eaton Centre mall, and across the street from the Toronto city hall.
[0.5161648988723755] This makes it an ideal location for vacationers, but a bit far if you have meetings in the main business district in the downtown core (although it's not too bad for that).
[0.5161648988723755] Stayed for three nights over (US) President's Day weekend-Friday to Monday.
[0.5161648988723755] The front desk arranged for a private transfer to the airport on my last morning at 4:15 AM and that w ent without a hitch.
