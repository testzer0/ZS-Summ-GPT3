[0.5161648988723755] Okay, enough on that rant.
[0.5161648988723755] No free business center to print boarding passes, etc...pc's in business center charged almost $2 per minute!!
[0.5161648988723755] One is my usual complaint of charging the exhorbitant fees for internet access in the guest rooms...this drives me crazy that I can go to a Holiday Inn Express and get free wireless internet in my room but the higher end hotels charge for it.

[0.47184109687805176] Internet connection in room rather pricey.
[0.4777953624725342] My only quibble would be that the business centre charged $3 for 5 minutes of computer time, but if you brought your own laptop, you could use it for free in the lobby.

[0.5025193095207214] And what is it with hotels charging more than $300 a night and still nickle and diming you with a daily internet charge?
