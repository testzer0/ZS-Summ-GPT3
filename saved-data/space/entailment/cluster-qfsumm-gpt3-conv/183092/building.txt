[0.5164624452590942] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[0.46804267168045044] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!
