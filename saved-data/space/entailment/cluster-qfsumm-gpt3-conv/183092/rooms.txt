[0.5161648988723755] Nice and clean gym on the top, typical hotel breakfast available downstairs.
[0.5161648988723755] We usually check out the amenities of every hotel we stay at but on this stay we had a long full day and just had time to settle in for a good nightâ€™s rest.
[0.5161648988723755] The room we had was a decent size and had a nice view.
[0.5161648988723755] The king bed was super comfortable â€“ you literally just sink right in, it feels so delicious just lying down.
[0.5161648988723755] The only negative for the guestroom was that the shower seemed to take an inordinately long time to achieve warm/hot water...literally 2-3 minutes.

[0.49462366104125977] Also a lot of the rooms face an office building, so theres not much privacy, because the curtains are very easily seen through, but overall if your willing to pay over 250 a night, your really only paying for the location and the walkway to the mall.
[0.5021414160728455] The shower however was very touchy and the water was either scalding hot or very cold.
[0.5161648988723755] I thought that was OK, so I accepted the room and settled in.
[0.5161648988723755] A few minutes later this person came to my room and handed me a key to another room that happened to have its line fixed already for that night.
[0.5161648988723755] The room itself was up to Marriott's usual standards - well done, not over-the-top luxurious, but very nice.
