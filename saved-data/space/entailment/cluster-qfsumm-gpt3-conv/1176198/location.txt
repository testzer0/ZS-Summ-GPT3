[0.43779686093330383] It was a quick walk to the shops and restaurants on Queen Street....try Fressen if you are vegetarian/vegan....its delish!
[0.44000187516212463] Surrounded by lots of restaurants and two less than two blocks from great shopping.
[0.4438459873199463] We could walk to the CN Tower and Skydome as well as many restaurants, and the customers we were calling on were close by, so the location in Toronto was great for us.
[0.4442885220050812] The hotel location is ideal for a visitor to the city, within easy walking distance of the entertainment district, the business district, and great shopping and dining.
[0.4487277567386627] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!

[0.5161648988723755] They also said that parking was an issue and that the nightclub next door could be loud.

[0.5194393396377563] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).

[0.49244263768196106] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.
[0.49244263768196106] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.
[0.4932754933834076] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.
[0.5161648988723755] It is not that hard to match up numbers on tickets to find a vehicle.
