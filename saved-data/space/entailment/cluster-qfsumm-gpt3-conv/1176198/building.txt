[0.49244263768196106] The building has a nice lobby with fresh cookies in the evening, an impressive pool and whirlpool area, and is within walking distance of Kensington Market.

[0.5161648988723755] The place is brand new so everything works just fine.
[0.5161648988723755] As we arrived, I was wondering why the front desk girl was all rushed while we were the only ones checking in.
[0.5161648988723755] The lobby is also small.
[0.5161648988723755] The hall was a bit noisy the first night because there were a lot of young adults staying there that night, but they finally quieted down.
[0.5161648988723755] I did hear them but maybe I just expect that city hum, having grown up in NY.

[0.47925785183906555] The lobby has delicious cookies every afternoon.
[0.49244263768196106] How easy could it have been for someone else to leave with our truck if they could bring us the wrong car?
[0.5161648988723755] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[0.5161648988723755] (once we figured out how to work all the shower heads) The walls were very thin though-we could really hear our neighbours mini party at 2AM in the morning.
[0.5161648988723755] Definately recommend the property.
