[0.5176506042480469] Eggs are cooked to order and are really good.
[0.5161648988723755] I found this hotel to have a better rate then others in downtown Toronto (which is not the same as saying it's cheap).
[0.5161648988723755] So you can pack a couple of apples or muffins for later in the day and save yourself some more money on food!
[0.5161648988723755] It would be great to see more cream in the room in future.
[0.5161648988723755] My only complaint was that there were only two tiny creamers but enough coffee to make 4 cups.
