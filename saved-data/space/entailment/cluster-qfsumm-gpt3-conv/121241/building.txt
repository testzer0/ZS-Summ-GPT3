[0.43022480607032776] There were dead bugs floating in the water, a hole in the wall under the window, a piece of wood holding a slide glass door open, chains on other doors that said "this entrance is in need of repairs, sorry for any inconvenience" or something to that affect.
[0.49244263768196106] We would never go back to this property again, because of the condition of the property, and the bad oders.
[0.5161648988723755] However, when we went into the building....the musty odor was horrible, the lobby area was humid as if the air conditioning wasn't on, the elevator smelled musty.
[0.5161648988723755] Planning on staying again in July, September and possibly December.
[0.5161648988723755] All 3 bldgs are old and need to be updated.. not with paint either...i mean gutted & refinished completely.

[0.5161648988723755] There are 3 different buildings in which one can stay, I found it confusing and the building we were in was the a long walk to the Front desk and where breakfast was.
