[0.5164624452590942] All in all, a great place to go for some fun times in Toronto!
[0.5164624452590942] First impression, it was in a decent area, not too far from the central part of downtown with all the restaurants and I thought ok, not too bad.
[0.5161648988723755] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.5161648988723755] We were there for a Chicago concert at Massey Hall and it was about a ten minute walk.
[0.5161648988723755] We did not use the restaurant in the hotel but did enjoy the Tim Hortons coffee shop beside the check in area.

[0.4768177270889282] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.

[0.49244263768196106] The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot!
