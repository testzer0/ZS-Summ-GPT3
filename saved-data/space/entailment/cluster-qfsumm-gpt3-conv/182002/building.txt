[0.5161648988723755] We also experienced the subway and found it was very easy to get around.
[0.5161648988723755] There aren't many facilities and the internet in my room cut out once in a while.
[0.5161648988723755] There were lots of restaurants around, and found the area and city in general to be very family friendly.
[0.5161648988723755] They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting.
[0.5161648988723755] Our car was broken into.

[0.5021414160728455] You have to drive very slow and carefully to make sure you don't damage your car.
[0.5082024335861206] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[0.5161648988723755] I instead parked a block away because the garage was full upon my checking in.
[0.5161648988723755] We were lost in a city we HAD never been in for 10 mintues during the night.
[0.5161648988723755] You might also get stuck in the elevator, though the manager said that it happens all the time.

[0.5161648988723755] However, some guests noted that there are no fire sprinklers in the guest areas, and that the elevator alarm button is often broken.
