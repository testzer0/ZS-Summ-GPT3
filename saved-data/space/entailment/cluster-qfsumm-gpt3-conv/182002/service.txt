[0.5161648988723755] The reviews were mostly negative, citing poor customer service, unreliable elevators and wireless internet, and a general feeling that the staff were only interested in money.

[0.4635000228881836] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.47184109687805176] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.
[0.49244263768196106] All they want is money.
[0.49244263768196106] Don't stay at this hotel unless you like slow (and possibly unsafe) elevators, flaky wireless Internet, and poor customer service.
[0.49244263768196106] The front desk person was very abrupt and had a serious attitude problem.

----- Weakening -----

[0.4282588064670563] the girl who checked us in was very nice but there was a cranky woman on the next day.
[0.49244263768196106] Staff was friendly, but not all that sure of area attractions.
[0.5006762146949768] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!
[0.5021414160728455] Although the front desk staff can be curt, the management are very helpful and accommodating.
[0.5161648988723755] The staff were friendly, helpful and the view of the Toronto skyline I had from my room was great.
