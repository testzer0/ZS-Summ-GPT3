[0.5161648988723755] The hotel was generally clean, although some reviewers noted that the carpets could have been better vacuumed and that the towels and pillowcases could have been fresher.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5161648988723755] Came into Toronto to meet up with some friends for a concert, booked a room on Hotwire looking for a good deal.
[0.5161648988723755] I will come back to Primrose.
[0.5161648988723755] We had made our travel arrangements through Orbitz and didn't know how to cancel part-way through the stay, which is the only reason we didn't check out early.
[0.5161648988723755] Check-in was fast and friendly.
[0.5161648988723755] Don't know how some of the vans got down there!

----- Weakening -----

[0.5161648988723755] For my next visit to Toronto I would hope to be able to stay at the Primrose again.
[0.5161648988723755] Drop off point for luggage check in is pretty small so if anyone is in front of you good luck accessing the hotel front door.
[0.5161648988723755] The laundry left something to be desired.
[0.5161648988723755] A pillow case had a blood stain on it(I think!
[0.5161648988723755] ), and the the bath towels had yellow stains and smelled "funky"!
