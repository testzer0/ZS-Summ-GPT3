[0.5161648988723755] The reviews were mixed, but generally speaking, people found the rooms to be clean and comfortable, though some found issue with the size of the elevators and the continental breakfast.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5161648988723755] We ended up with 12 rooms in total and no one in our group had any problems or complaints.
[0.5161648988723755] They were also able to give us rooms all on the same floor which made things much easier to get ready on the morning of the wedding.
[0.5161648988723755] I was very pleased with the arrangements made, and since we werenâ€™t exactly sure how many rooms we needed, the hotel allowed us to reserve 15 rooms, and provided we told them a few weeks in advance, didnâ€™t charge us for the rooms which we didnâ€™t need.
[0.5161648988723755] Over all our hotel was clean and we had a newly renovated room.
[0.5161648988723755] We had a good time in the city and would use the Primrose Hotel again.

----- Weakening -----

[0.4929588735103607] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
[0.5161648988723755] The Primrose is a good hotel for people who plan on staying just a few dates in Toronto and plan on only sleeping there.
[0.5161648988723755] The room are clean.
[0.5161648988723755] The bathroom needed a little work but it was good enough for my needs.
[0.5161648988723755] The non-free continental breakfast is a joke.
