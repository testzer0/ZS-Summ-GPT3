[0.5176506042480469] check in was fast & friendly,location is close to shopping,10 min from disney,15 min from universal & seaworld,1 hr from daytona & cape kennedy.
[0.5164624452590942] this hotel is ideally located for disney as there is a road out of the back of the hotel which is a short cut to disney world , turn right out of rear of hotel , left at t junction 2 mins later you are on disney , right by animal kingdom .
[0.5164624452590942] Superb location for Disney with a back road out of the hotel that cuts out all the queues on the 192.
[0.5164624452590942] Located 2 miles from Interstate 4 and one mile from Disney entrances, the hotel is ideal for those going to Disney.
[0.5164624452590942] The hotel is actually in a good position on the 192 highway, really near to disney & close to lots of good places to eat - red lobster was the best it was just across the road.

[0.46870243549346924] The parking lot was clean, the location of the hotel was GREAT (right next to many restaraunts, souvenier shops, and within 5 minutes to the Disnet World Parks).
[0.491728276014328] We would stay here again, if you want more luxury it is not for you, if you want a clean safe place and conveniently located for parks then its perfect!
[0.49557673931121826] However the best bit of this hotel is by far the location, just 2 mile from Disney and surrounded by quality restaurants and shops, you can not go wrong.
[0.5006762146949768] The location to Disney is ideal & for the amount of time spent in your room I find this hotel ideal, at a bargain price.
[0.5006762146949768] I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.

[0.5161648988723755] However, some reviewers mention that the hotel is difficult to get to without a car.

[0.5161648988723755] Firstly, reception won't really care as we found them quite surely and unhelpful, and secondly the rooms are not gleaming and smelling of rose petals!
[0.5161648988723755] Location was good - on the 192, 5mins from Interstate 4 - 40mins sea world and universal, 1hr to Busch Gardens, 1hr 15 to Kennedy Space Center.
[0.5161648988723755] Hire car and drive from Sanford - ok, but be aware this hotel has changed name and the directions given by First Choice still refer to the old name.
[0.5161648988723755] Booked last minute through first choice websie as a lads holiday - Â£303pp B&B for 7 nights, flights from Manchester and Hire Car incl.
[0.5161648988723755] We had a fantastic time in florida.

[0.4848579168319702] Although this is by no means a luxurious residence, it is a perfect place to stay if you are intending to visit the theme parks, although a car is essential.
[0.4927403926849365] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.5006762146949768] I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.
[0.5006762146949768] Located on a loud busy road frequantly used by the local fire departmentand large lorries, Constant pestering from the ticket stand to sell you a timeshare and tickets.
[0.5006762146949768] BUT personally i always stay clear of international drive as i find it quite run down and too busy............if you enjoy the 192 area of kissimee then this hotel is fine!
