[0.5164624452590942] We were not being overly fussy, the chinese eat as much as you can next door is highly recommended.
[0.5164624452590942] There are countless places to eat around the hotel & there's an all you can eat chinese buffet next door that's good.
[0.5161648988723755] Sick of fatty junk food after the second day, and despite our quest to eat in a half respectable fashion, no luck was had.
[0.5161648988723755] There are loads of places to eat locally, although you will have trouble if you want 5% healthy food 5% of the time.
[0.5161648988723755] I didn't try it myself.

[0.4587460160255432] I guess as the saying goes you get what you pay for as we didn't pay much for the 4 of us we were pleased and surprised.
[0.461546391248703] We were on a budget so this place was perfect for the price.
[0.4810456931591034] For the price we paid, what more could you ask for?
[0.4846378564834595] Area around isn't bad we had a different restaurant every night of our 14night stay, try the corral more than you can eat for $6.99 and I mean more than you can eat food was really nice, red lobster was good so was the minning company.
