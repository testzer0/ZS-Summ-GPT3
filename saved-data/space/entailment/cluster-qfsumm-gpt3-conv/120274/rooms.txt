[0.5164624452590942] When I received my room key and I entered the room I thought WOW.
[0.5161648988723755] It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!
[0.5161648988723755] You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.
[0.5161648988723755] This is really only a basic hotel that doesn't provide many extras.

[0.5161648988723755] The less said about the pool though the better.
[0.5161648988723755] This hotel provides you with what you would expect for the price, and the cleanliness of our room gave us no real concerns.
[0.5161648988723755] We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.

[0.5161648988723755] This was our 5th visit to Orlando and our first budget trip and i have to say that this little gem of a hotel is far superior to other more expensive ones in the area.
[0.5161648988723755] The pool was a good size, very clean and looked out onto the lake.
[0.5161648988723755] I would highly recommend a trip to the Rainforest Cafe in Downtown Disney, Hardrock Cafe in Universal, Bennigans on I drive and Johnny Rockets at the Pointe they are all brilliant!!
