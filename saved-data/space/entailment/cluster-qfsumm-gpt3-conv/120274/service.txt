[0.5161648988723755] I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!
[0.5161648988723755] CAR NEEDED, although there is a free shuttle to some parks.

[0.4698827266693115] From previous experience from other hotels they usually only have limited pick ups for the parks.
[0.4858441650867462] First, the shuttle service they offered took us to the wrong theme park 40 minutes late without any explanation.
[0.49244263768196106] Maintenace came and sprayed floor and when we woke the next morning there were ants on nightstand, dresser, bathroom walls and shower.

[0.4932754933834076] Don't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney!

[0.5161648988723755] There was also mention of an additional fee that was added to guests' bills.

[0.45329758524894714] Also, they hit you up with some kind of $1.86 a night fee tacked onto your bill...surprise!
[0.4932754933834076] The evening clerk was a little weak in communicating in English so I really didn't get an adequate explanation of the charge.
[0.5006762146949768] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
[0.5050140023231506] over $12.00 was added to our room bill due to the "free local calls".
[0.5161648988723755] All the staff were extremely helpful, friendly and approachable.

Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
