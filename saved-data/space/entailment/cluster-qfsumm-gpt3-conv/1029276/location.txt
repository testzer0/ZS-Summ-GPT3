[0.5161648988723755] We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton.
[0.5161648988723755] Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.
[0.5161648988723755] Would never stay here again and maybe not at another Hilton either.
[0.5161648988723755] Great view was the only good thing at this hotel.
[0.5161648988723755] Great value for the money we spent and not that far from airport.

[0.4203823506832123] Bayside Plaza is a short taxi ride away which is a lot of fun especially on Super Bowl week end and the Metromover is just a block away which gives access to Metrorail.
[0.45015600323677063] The Downtown Miami Hilton is on the fringe of the downtown area but very close to the light rail and a short drive to S. Beach and Little Havana.
[0.47842636704444885] Location is decent- fairly close to real downtown, very close to bus and train terminal for south beach etc.

[0.45218709111213684] As we had a car ,the location was not a problem.South Beach is just a short drive across the bridge and we took a taxi to Bayside.We ordered room service for breakfast and it was excellent.
[0.4588536322116852] The location was good, very close to the Bayside area and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach.
[0.46803075075149536] The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun.
[0.47039303183555603] South beach is a 15 minutes drive.
[0.48206090927124023] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.

[0.5164624452590942] Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs.
[0.5164624452590942] I also did not care for the $28/ day parking fee.
[0.5164624452590942] I did not like the area the hotel was in i would of prefered south beach area.

[0.4212968051433563] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.44905099272727966] Give it 4 out of 5 for location, but 2 out of 5 for service.
[0.46494847536087036] The hotel restaurant was adequate; however, the staff here also strived to please.
[0.46804267168045044] Things looked not so nice a few blocks further away, so we did not walked around the area.
[0.47626805305480957] Not a terrible place, but I have to say that I've stayed in nicer places that are less expensive.
