[0.5161648988723755] We called the front desk and they sent someone up to check.
[0.5161648988723755] Spent 6 days here for a conference and workshop.
[0.5161648988723755] The central fire station is located a few blocks down from this hotel.
[0.5161648988723755] We finally got to the lobby and due to the many marathon guests, it was busy.
[0.5161648988723755] But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking.

[0.4380100667476654] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
[0.4448891580104828] Also lots of construction on the streets make sure you plan to leave a bit early especially on the weekend.
[0.4640374481678009] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.46939727663993835] The renovations were the least of our worries.
[0.4769640564918518] Hotel could do with a refurbishment.

[0.4777953624725342] The downtown is a ghost town except for a couple of hotels and Bayside.
