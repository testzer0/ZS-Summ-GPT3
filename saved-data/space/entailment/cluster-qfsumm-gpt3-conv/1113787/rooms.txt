[0.5164624452590942] Charlie Palmer cooks the room service menu but it is different menu than restaurant and didn't look as good (no foie gras).
[0.5161648988723755] Let's not forget the pool, great relaxing spot.
[0.5161648988723755] This was a enjoyable place to spend the weekend .
[0.5161648988723755] Dallas was one of the most friendly places I've visited and this hotel is right up there with making you feel at home.
[0.5161648988723755] I stayed at the Joule in Feb for a quick little training session I was sent to.

[0.4345661997795105] Our tweens loved the salt water heated infinity pool, the Charlie Palmer bar, awesome room service and gorgeous room......we live in Carrollton, but felt we had traveled to another luxurious country!
[0.44278791546821594] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[0.44622746109962463] The rooms are awesome except for the lack of privacy in the toilets that others have mentioned.
[0.4541575312614441] They finally were ok with the outside food once they realized we were NOT moving it and were still quite unhappy about the pool situation.
[0.4603884816169739] There was a mix-up with an upgrade for our room, but that was the only disappointment with our stay.

[0.5161648988723755] The rooms are astonishing, my favorite detail in the entire room was the lights that are built into the headboard.

[0.483467698097229] Stay here - it's expensive, but absolutely worth it - we plan on returning next anniversary!
[0.49244263768196106] This hotel would have been adequate if the room price was much less.
[0.49244263768196106] I would say for us, it was beyond luxury!
[0.5006762146949768] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".
[0.5021414160728455] Loved that the desk was behind the headboard - clever use of space!
