[0.44160428643226624] Charlie Palmer (the Joule's in house restaurant) is whole other raving review waiting to happen.
[0.4505247473716736] the hotel has an excellent in house restaurant with plenty on the menu and delectable choices.

[0.45348960161209106] We were disappointed about the hours of the Charlie Palmer and the bar downstairs but found an outstanding place to get a drink directly across the street.
[0.45409953594207764] I stopped into Charlie Palmer for dinner, had a fantastic time there, Tommy the bartender took great care of me and the food was out of this world.

[0.5161648988723755] However, it is also in a somewhat cramped area with a loading dock at the front of the building.

[0.5161648988723755] parking was $10/day.

[0.46530991792678833] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.49244263768196106] There is a Neiman Marcus and a decent Mexican restaurant next door, but there's also a boarded up building.
[0.49244263768196106] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[0.49244263768196106] The staff at the hotel and the parking company (ACE parking) are working hard to rectify the situation, but at $27/night for parking one would hope that her car was more secure than it apparently was.
