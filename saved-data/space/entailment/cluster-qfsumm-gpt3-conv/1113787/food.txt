[0.5161648988723755] I only ordered a pot of coffee for 7am.
[0.5161648988723755] Plus my husband doesn't drink and I'm 6 mths pregnant, so pretty sure we didn't access any alcohol at the mini bar.
[0.5161648988723755] Once I arrived, Danielle took great care to check me in and point me in the direction of my room, which I didn't leave much unless it was to have a meeting downstairs in the restaurant.
[0.5161648988723755] I'd definetely recommend 3 things if you are staying at The Joule: 1) Eat at Charlie Palmer - This is the restaurant right in the hotel.
[0.5161648988723755] As an order of french toast was around $20 I decided to walk down the street (out the front, down one block to left, take a left and Seven Eleven was on the right) and get a donut and some milk.
