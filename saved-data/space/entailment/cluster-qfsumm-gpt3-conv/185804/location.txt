[0.5221541523933411] They have a restaurant, and while we didn't eat there, it was packed and looked really good.
[0.5176506042480469] The restuarant in the hotel is quite nice and despite its "brewery" designation is much more of a full menu than you might expect.
[0.5176506042480469] Granville Island is a great location to base a trip from if you are staying in Vancouver.
[0.5164624452590942] The location is an ideal jumping off point to some of the more interesting sites in Vancouver: Kitsilano, Jericho Beach, The Endowment Lands and Robson Street.
[0.5164624452590942] via AquaBus, and that's only if you have time to do any of that after checking out all the great places on the Island.

[0.4146277606487274] The top reason we continue to choose this hotel is its location.
[0.42155465483665466] This location is amazing- I mean you don't have to drive anywhere to get food, drink, entertainment and culture.
[0.422447144985199] Did check out the restaurant during regular business hours several times and the food, service and beer brewed on premisise was an all around thumbs up!
[0.42410311102867126] The location, although not downtown, was still great.
[0.43154090642929077] An enjoyable place to stay.

[0.5161648988723755] It is right on the water with a view of Vancouver, there is lots to do and see in the area, and it is easy to get to from the ferry.

[0.5161648988723755] it is a getaway in the middle of the city.
[0.5161648988723755] on location - it is not downtown but across the water.
[0.5161648988723755] Thirdly, the restaurant was excellent.
[0.5161648988723755] So apart from location, what else commended it to me?
[0.5161648988723755] Overlooking a marina and with fine views over Vancouver it really is ideally situated.

[0.44591450691223145] This hotel is located close enough to downtown to walk to in 1/2 hour( using the aquabus to cross the channel) but also very close to local interesting sites on granville island and is a 15 min walk to Broadway St and 4th Ave where there are numerous placed to eat.
[0.4569042921066284] The wonderful public market and numerous restaurants and shops are just a quick walk away, as are the ferries that take you to other parts of Vancouver.
[0.4777953624725342] We would eat breakfast in the Market take one of the super cute little ferries over to Vancouver, explore the city and then take a cab back for a peaceful dinner in one of the many very nice restaurants on the island.
[0.4777953624725342] Also an easy walk to 4th Ave. which is great up towards Arbutus, Kits beach, and you can step right out the hotel door onto the SeaWall for a run around False Creek.
[0.4805809259414673] Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes.

[0.5161648988723755] Some reviewers mention that the trees in front of the hotel block the view, but others say that the view is still good.

[0.5161648988723755] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[0.5161648988723755] Being a only a few minutes walk to Granville Island Market and a variety of nice, small shops was a bonus.

[0.5021414160728455] Thirdly, the restaurant was excellent.
[0.5161648988723755] Even though we had requested the basic "non-view" category, our little balcony had a view of the water across to downtown, and a bonus was the fireworks over Science World (after all, it was Halloween).
[0.5161648988723755] The area is amazing with lots of shopping, great food and beautiful views!
[0.5161648988723755] Thanks again for a great Vacouver visit!
[0.5161648988723755] At the hotel’s restaurant where I ate often, the service was attentive and friendly; they even went out of their way tonight to make a strawberry compote for the cheesecake because I didn’t want the cherry compote!
