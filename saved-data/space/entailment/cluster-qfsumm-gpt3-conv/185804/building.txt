[0.5021414160728455] We arrived a little late on Xmas day after a troublesome time with the car rental company (Budget did not have a car for me despite having a valid reservation).
[0.5117378234863281] Bad Points * half renovated the common areas are nice, the bathrooms have no bath tubs but new bathrooms.
[0.5161648988723755] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.5161648988723755] While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!

[0.49244263768196106] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[0.49244263768196106] The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.
[0.4932754933834076] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
