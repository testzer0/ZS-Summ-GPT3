[-0.9148139953613281] Hotel rooms and restaurant = great "Valet" = brutal and ruined the whole stay.
[-0.9038810729980469] I truly disliked the bed.
[-0.8998203277587891] That was a bit of a pain, but understandable, because it was getting extremely rowdy and it was clear people were bringing in about 10 people into one room.
[-0.8882617950439453] This night was a bit of a mess; we would walk out to the hallway and smell weed, hear loud music blasting, etc.

[0.94195556640625] There was a little noise in the adjacent rooms, walls are paper-thin as in most hotels.
[0.03128814697265625] In the bathroom you feel like you are in a space capsule and these are a little cramped but lets face it how much time do you spend in a bathroom...in and out right!
[0.028564453125] we were so tired and sore from bad sleep we went home early on monday without shopping or anything the room was kind of plain we had the room with a jacuzzi and fireplace but both nights when we were in bed sleeping the jacuzzi mysteriously turned on and woke us both up and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off.

[0.9362821578979492] Parking rates are high as you will find in all major cities around the world.
[0.9063491821289062] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.
[0.8559036254882812] It was worth the cost of the parking just to have their assistance.
[0.8418617248535156] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.

[-0.8164825439453125] For a price of $10 we had a choice of hot and cold items, both ready made, and made to order.

[-0.7451171875] I truly disliked the bed.

[0.0054931640625] Clearly they need more than two valet guys working on a Sunday morning when everyone is checking out for the weekend There was a party going on at 1-2AM beside one of our rooms.
