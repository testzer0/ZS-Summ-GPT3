[-0.8622121810913086] It is very worn and in a terrible area of town.
[-0.6292524337768555] I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump.
[-0.6091861724853516] We didnâ€™t realize that the Primrose Best Western hotel was in the middle of a large prostitution area, until we left and noticed the building was surrounded by dozens of prostitutes.

[0.32109832763671875] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).

[0.9291877746582031] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.8915882110595703] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.8575210571289062] The parking garage was a little tight to drive around in, but other than that, I would definately go back for another weekend with the guys.
[0.8566646575927734] The underground parking is horribly laid out.
[0.8481712341308594] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.

[0.06639862060546875] A tip to all travelers â€“ doesnâ€™t matter where you go or where you stay, there are people out there who are thieves..any traveling we will do now will ensure that our valuables are left in the hotel safe and we wear a money belt.
[0.023223876953125] Drop off point for luggage check in is pretty small so if anyone is in front of you good luck accessing the hotel front door.
[0.022182464599609375] The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out.
[0.01769256591796875] Weâ€™ve travelled to some very poor countries in our lives, but weâ€™ve never seen such dirty conditions!
[0.015071868896484375] But we didnt realise they were as bad as they were, on the 3rd time of using them we got stuck!!
