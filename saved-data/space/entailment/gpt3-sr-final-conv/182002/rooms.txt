----- Weakening -----

[-0.9780540466308594] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.

[-0.9442558288574219] I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump.

[0.11639404296875] The only issue I did not like was that the fan in the bathroom automatically turns on when you turn on the light, and usually my wife likes to sleep with the bathroom light on, but we didnâ€™t as the fan would be running.
[0.0427703857421875] Loved the Tim Hortons in the Lobby the next morning.
[0.02587890625] The rooms are old, the bathroom smelled, we had a view of air conditioners and the gym was a joke.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7852554321289062] My only complaint would have been that they have a lovely grand piano in the lobby and while I was trying to enjoy my breakfast there was a child playing around on it.
[-0.77569580078125] Also which was bothersome was the wifi.
[-0.75506591796875] Had daily continental or hot breakfast for an unreasonable cost for the 'menu' - try the local restaurants or delivery) Overall, reasonable cost for duration; comfortable, quiet, clean rooms; and you receive Best Western Club points or Airmiles for your stay.

[0.9212827682495117] There were 'ladies of the night' out front of the hotel, but they were harmless and didn't hassle us at all.
[0.8863239288330078] We had a small issue on check out as a long distance call which we did not place (we didnâ€™t know anyone in Seattle) got accidently added to our bill, but they reversed the charge so it wasnâ€™t a major issue.
[0.8822612762451172] A few very minor complaints - the bathroom was very small and a bit cold, since the only heat was from a small baseboard heater.

[0.726776123046875] An annoyance rather than trouble really.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8194503784179688] The two main things I did apprieciate was, the free wireless internet, and the fact there was a Tim hortons right in the lobby.
[-0.8151988983154297] This is especially important now that they are installing kitchenettes in some of the rooms.
[-0.680694580078125] But we didnt realise they were as bad as they were, on the 3rd time of using them we got stuck!!
[-0.6562652587890625] The biggest disappointments were: -Elevators (being "updated", bumpy ride, not reliable-ended up on a floor we didn't know we could access!)
