[0.45169925689697266] Charlie Palmers is connected to the hotel and it is excellent.
[0.2988777160644531] You can walk next door to iron cactus for bfast and lunch, then eat dinner at the ultra swanky Charlie Palmer.
[0.06039237976074219] There are a lot of pluses - the feel, the location, the pool, Charlie Palmer, the service, the workout facilities.
[0.046688079833984375] I'd definetely recommend 3 things if you are staying at The Joule: 1) Eat at Charlie Palmer - This is the restaurant right in the hotel.
[0.03289794921875] Our tweens loved the salt water heated infinity pool, the Charlie Palmer bar, awesome room service and gorgeous room......we live in Carrollton, but felt we had traveled to another luxurious country!

[-0.73883056640625] Also, it was very nice to be next door to Neiman Marcus.
[-0.6278343200683594] I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.
[-0.6116123199462891] It needs to be removed ASAP.
[-0.5226383209228516] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[-0.5037765502929688] Maybe I just had a bad experience but I was throughly disappointed in this hotel.

[0.7143087387084961] The pool is great, it has great night life, and the rooms and beds are great!
[0.6087417602539062] The accomodations were wonderful, the canti-levered pool was gorgeous and the lobby ultra chiq...but the best attribute by far was the care and attention to detail given by Henry and the valet staff!
[0.5892696380615234] This is an excellent hotel with an amazing rooftop pool and lounge area.
[0.5276851654052734] absolutely beautiful property, rooms are spacious and modern, roof-top pool area is excellent, and restaurant is 5-star.

[0.5919532775878906] We wish the weather had been warmer so we could have tried out the pool.
[0.5138397216796875] Well it started off BAD within 10 mins we had went to the pool where we find about 5 young ladies workin and just stood there looking like we where not even there, so I was like excuse me can I get a drink.
[0.29468536376953125] The pool was too chilly for the kids to spend much time in it, but that isn't surprising for this time of year.
[0.22249889373779297] Wish the weather had been nice enough to use the pool.
[0.06975936889648438] The only downside was that I was there in January, and the Poule was not open.

[-0.9377284049987793] Fun pool atmosphere!
[-0.923095703125] We were staying only one night and were most looking forward to lounging leisurely next to the beautiful pool on Sunday afternoon.

[-0.86749267578125] Swam at the pool on the roof one day and had breakfast in the restaurant.
