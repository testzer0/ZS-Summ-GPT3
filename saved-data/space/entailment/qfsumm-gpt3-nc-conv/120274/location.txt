[0.5010779500007629] The location of the hotel is a little out of the way for Universal, Prime Outlets (formerly Beltz), IDrive etc but it's only 5 minutes from Disney, you can see the top of Expedition Everest from the car park at the back!

[0.49906739592552185] Firstly, reception won't really care as we found them quite surely and unhelpful, and secondly the rooms are not gleaming and smelling of rose petals!
[0.49906739592552185] Location was good - on the 192, 5mins from Interstate 4 - 40mins sea world and universal, 1hr to Busch Gardens, 1hr 15 to Kennedy Space Center.
[0.49906739592552185] Hire car and drive from Sanford - ok, but be aware this hotel has changed name and the directions given by First Choice still refer to the old name.
[0.49906739592552185] Booked last minute through first choice websie as a lads holiday - Â£303pp B&B for 7 nights, flights from Manchester and Hire Car incl.

----- Weakening -----

[0.49906739592552185] The location to Disney is ideal & for the amount of time spent in your room I find this hotel ideal, at a bargain price.
[0.49906739592552185] I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.
[0.49906739592552185] The good...the place was close to the main entrance to Disney and lots of food choices nearby to eat.
[0.49906739592552185] I stayed at a nice resort the week before and thought I remembered this one but it turns out...it was the hotel next door I should have reserved.
[0.49906739592552185] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
