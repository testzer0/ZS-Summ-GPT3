[0.5028122663497925] just got back from 2 weeks at Qi, we just used it as a base to plan our disney wedding, we have stayed at the other 2 Qi's on I drive and this was by far the best, it had everthing you need around i.e dennys, walgreens etc, we could see animal kingdom from hotel so that give you idea of how close to disney, room was clean and cleaned daily, no problem with anyhting apart from what previous guests have said about limited seating for breakfast but no prob as we took it back to room!!
