----- Supporting -----

[0.5212505459785461] Never in my life have I spent so much in one place and been treated so poorly.
[0.5127663612365723] staff was lovely except the lady who checked me in , wasnt a happy person , she didnt check me in until she make sure that i m a hilton employee , which i m not very happy about .
[0.5124024748802185] Hotel did not offer taxi that day so I had to walk and pulled my back out.
[0.5124024748802185] The front desk was very curtious and all the staff always said hello.
[0.5093427896499634] All in all, the hotel never bent backwards to compensate for our time involved making calls, getting key made, needing time off work,and driving back.

[0.47845178842544556] Also, the staff for some reason couldn't seem to do the sums right!
[0.48032647371292114] I would NOT recommend giving this hotel your business.
[0.48131152987480164] They told us in a very rude tone and with attitude that our credit card had been declined over the last few days and that they had tried it several time so we would have to provide a cash deposit.
[0.48241546750068665] We complained the next morning and they said we should have complained the night of ... but other people we talked to said that they did complain and nothing happened.
[0.49128198623657227] It was a pretty good deal but this experience left me feeling like they took advantage of me when they were supposed to be helpful.

**********

[0.49906739592552185] Complaints included no housekeeping/maid service, having to track down a maid to request towels, being given the wrong car when asking for the valet, and being told that their guest could only visit for 10 minutes.

[0.5124024748802185] We went down 20 minutes later ready to go and the guy said it would be another 20 minutes!
[0.5124024748802185] and that after 10 minutes they were going to come up into our room to check if our guest was still there??!!
[0.49906739592552185] Horrible !
[0.49906739592552185] it doesnt matter if im hilton employee or not , check me in first, make me feel welcome and then when i leave the front desk , call to check the level of my honesty , and if im not hilton employee , all you have to do is switch rate and give me call to let me know !!!
[0.49906739592552185] staff was lovely except the lady who checked me in , wasnt a happy person , she didnt check me in until she make sure that i m a hilton employee , which i m not very happy about .

[0.49906739592552185] But then it was all down hill from there.
[0.49906739592552185] First, there was absolutely no housecleaning/maid service!
[0.49906739592552185] Second, after 11pm you have to use your room card to get into the building.
[0.49906739592552185] After swiping your card then you are questioned by someone about which room you are going to.
[0.49906739592552185] The staff on the front desk were very polite and helpful.
