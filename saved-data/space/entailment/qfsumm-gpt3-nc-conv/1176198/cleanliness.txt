[0.5274121165275574] Hotel rooms and restaurant = great "Valet" = brutal and ruined the whole stay.
[0.5173357725143433] Valet lost the key to our Mercedes Benz!
[0.5119321346282959] Also, wifi/internet is free.
[0.5119321346282959] My only complaint about the room was the Wi-Fi...terrible signal from it and half the time (at least) I couldn't even get on the internet.
[0.5119321346282959] The valet ticket says to call down 30 minutes before you want to leave.

[0.4921990633010864] However the carpet in the room had 2 stains.
[0.4923340082168579] We were there for 4 days/3 nights and every day we had to track down a maid to request clean towels.

[0.49906739592552185] The whirpool was great - it is located in the bedroom rather than the bathroom and was big enough for two!
[0.49906739592552185] Also very convenient was the free in-room wifi which I really appreciated as so many hotels still do not offer the in-room wifi option.
