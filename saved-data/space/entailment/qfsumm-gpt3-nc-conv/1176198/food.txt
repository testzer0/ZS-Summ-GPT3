----- Supporting -----

[0.49906739592552185] I found this hotel to have a better rate then others in downtown Toronto (which is not the same as saying it's cheap).
[0.49906739592552185] There's good coffee nearby (I'm fairly sure that they didn't offer breakfast).
[0.49906739592552185] Price was good, too.
[0.49906739592552185] Has a large variety of food and was very good.
[0.49906739592552185] The food at dinner was very good and the breakfast that was included with the room package was excellent.

----- Weakening -----

[0.49906739592552185] I really don't have anything bad to say about this hotel, the price is a little steep per night but it is definitely worth it.
[0.49906739592552185] The price is very reasonabe and the quality of the food was great.
[0.49906739592552185] The dining option was reasonable and the food (dinner & breakfast) was ok. Actually, dinner was of better quality than I was expecting since this wasn't a full service Hilton.
[0.49906739592552185] There was even a decent wine selction and a waiter that offered reliable advice.
[0.49906739592552185] Tons of little restaurants, small shops (not big retail stores), kind of an artsy feel.
