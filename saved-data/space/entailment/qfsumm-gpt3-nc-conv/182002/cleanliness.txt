[0.49906739592552185] Came into Toronto to meet up with some friends for a concert, booked a room on Hotwire looking for a good deal.
[0.49906739592552185] I will come back to Primrose.
[0.49906739592552185] We had made our travel arrangements through Orbitz and didn't know how to cancel part-way through the stay, which is the only reason we didn't check out early.
[0.49906739592552185] Check-in was fast and friendly.
[0.49906739592552185] Don't know how some of the vans got down there!

[0.49906739592552185] Drop off point for luggage check in is pretty small so if anyone is in front of you good luck accessing the hotel front door.
