[0.5124024748802185] My second room also had a window that would not close, there were beer caps scattered throughout the room, there was hair in the tub and on the toilet seat, and the room smelt like an ashtray.
[0.5124024748802185] A few very minor complaints - the bathroom was very small and a bit cold, since the only heat was from a small baseboard heater.
[0.5124024748802185] Almost decided to move to another hotel, but didn't because didn't want to go in hassle of moving the luggage with kids, etc.
[0.5124024748802185] My suggestion for the hotel though is try to get a room away from the elevator.
[0.5124024748802185] The shower was disgusting and there were marks all over the walls and carpet.

[0.49906739592552185] The Primrose is a good hotel for people who plan on staying just a few dates in Toronto and plan on only sleeping there.
