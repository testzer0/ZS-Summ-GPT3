[0.49906739592552185] The location was praised for being close to a subway station, as well as being in walking distance to a large mall and what is described as Toronto's equivalent of Times Square.

[0.5124024748802185] Close to CN tower too!
[0.5078831315040588] The place was in a good location and I was able to walk to a huge mall and what I guess is Torontoâ€™s equivalent of Times Square.
[0.5006835460662842] There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.
[0.49906739592552185] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.49906739592552185] We were there for a Chicago concert at Massey Hall and it was about a ten minute walk.
