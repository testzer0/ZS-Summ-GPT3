[0.5124024748802185] Only small issue was when I went to iron my pants the iron was broken.
[0.5094516277313232] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!
[0.49906739592552185] We also experienced the subway and found it was very easy to get around.
[0.49906739592552185] There aren't many facilities and the internet in my room cut out once in a while.
[0.49906739592552185] There were lots of restaurants around, and found the area and city in general to be very family friendly.

----- Weakening -----

[0.49906739592552185] I instead parked a block away because the garage was full upon my checking in.
[0.49906739592552185] We were lost in a city we HAD never been in for 10 mintues during the night.
[0.49906739592552185] You might also get stuck in the elevator, though the manager said that it happens all the time.
[0.49906739592552185] And if you're lucky the alarm button in the elevator will have been fixed by then.
[0.49906739592552185] You should also be aware that there are no fire sprinklers in the guest areas of the hotel.

[0.49906739592552185] They have done some renovations to the lobby area which is now a nice granite counter and some darker woods which look very warm and inviting.
