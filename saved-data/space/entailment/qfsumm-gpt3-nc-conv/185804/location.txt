[0.49906739592552185] The reviews said that the location was great with lovely views, close to attractions but far enough away to provide peace, and with lots of shopping and great food options.

[0.517362654209137] There is great restaurants close by, downtown is easily accessible, you have an amazing view of the city and the mountains, and you can have a quite night of sleep!
[0.5147485136985779] The biggest obivious attraction of this hotel is its location - smack dab in the middle of Granville Island, and therefore close to the restaurants, markets, shops, and galleries that are all nearby.
[0.5147485136985779] As they say there "No worries", because you could duck in and out of the little shops and galleries without getting too wet, and when a real downpour came as we were dressed up and heading into the city, we were offered a huge umbrella by the staff, which we kept until check out.
[0.5147485136985779] We would eat breakfast in the Market take one of the super cute little ferries over to Vancouver, explore the city and then take a cab back for a peaceful dinner in one of the many very nice restaurants on the island.
[0.5147485136985779] This location is amazing- I mean you don't have to drive anywhere to get food, drink, entertainment and culture.

[0.49611514806747437] The staff, rooms and food are outstanding and the there's the location.
[0.49611514806747437] The highlight was the restaurant, which had the best food on the island and quite possibly in all of Vancouver's westside.

----- Supporting -----

[0.49906739592552185] it is a getaway in the middle of the city.
[0.49906739592552185] on location - it is not downtown but across the water.
[0.49906739592552185] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[0.49906739592552185] Being a only a few minutes walk to Granville Island Market and a variety of nice, small shops was a bonus.
[0.49906739592552185] Thirdly, the restaurant was excellent.

[0.49906739592552185] Even though we had requested the basic "non-view" category, our little balcony had a view of the water across to downtown, and a bonus was the fireworks over Science World (after all, it was Halloween).
[0.49906739592552185] The area is amazing with lots of shopping, great food and beautiful views!
[0.49906739592552185] Thanks again for a great Vacouver visit!
[0.49906739592552185] At the hotel’s restaurant where I ate often, the service was attentive and friendly; they even went out of their way tonight to make a strawberry compote for the cheesecake because I didn’t want the cherry compote!
[0.49906739592552185] If you’re looking for a walk-able and relaxing spot then this couldn’t be better!
