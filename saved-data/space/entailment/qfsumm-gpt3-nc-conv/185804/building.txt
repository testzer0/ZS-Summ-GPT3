[0.49906739592552185] The reviews were generally positive, praising the design of the hotel and its convenient location.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5032962560653687] The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.
[0.49906739592552185] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
[0.49906739592552185] Nothing a little renovation couldn't quickly take care of.
[0.49906739592552185] We went to the Pacific Culinary Institute and that was amazing!
[0.49906739592552185] I'd have given it 5 stars if only the desk chair hadn't had arms and been a royal pain to move around.

----- Weakening -----

[0.49611514806747437] It was a fun, informative, and flexible way to view the entire city.
[0.49906739592552185] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.49906739592552185] While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
[0.49906739592552185] He was very impressed and requested a tour of the brewery, which the brew-master provided for him.
[0.49906739592552185] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.

[0.49906739592552185] However, some guests noted that the art in the public spaces could be improved, and that the hair dryers in the rooms were not very good.

[0.49906739592552185] The hotel's lobby was undergoing renovations at the time but it never created any issues with our stay.
