[0.49906739592552185] We called the front desk and they sent someone up to check.
[0.49906739592552185] Spent 6 days here for a conference and workshop.
[0.49906739592552185] The central fire station is located a few blocks down from this hotel.
[0.49906739592552185] We finally got to the lobby and due to the many marathon guests, it was busy.
[0.49906739592552185] But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking.

----- Weakening -----

[0.49906739592552185] Hotel could do with a refurbishment.
[0.49906739592552185] We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier.
[0.49906739592552185] The renovations were the least of our worries.
[0.49906739592552185] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.49906739592552185] Last night i took it back from Bayside and the car was filled with drunk teens that were looking for a fight.

[0.48292961716651917] When we finally got to the lobby (because it's a little bit tricky) it was full of people checking in, but everything ran just perfect thanks to the professionalism and friendly attitude of the front desk agents.
[0.4987044334411621] Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards.
