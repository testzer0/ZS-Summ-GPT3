[0.5124024748802185] Location was great 200 yds from Omni station for free Metro Mover + local bus station ($2 one way anywhere on route).
[0.5124024748802185] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.5119321346282959] $28 for valet parking, really????
[0.5119321346282959] The restaurant on the main level was excellent, had a variety of food and drinks.
[0.5119321346282959] Good restaurant.

[0.48241546750068665] The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun.
[0.4861566722393036] Nearby Bin 18 is a wonderful restaurant, and was recommended by the concierge (David, who was also very helpful and nice).
[0.4885527491569519] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!
[0.49049896001815796] Our stay at the Hilton Downtown Miami was nothing short of perfect.
[0.49611514806747437] The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet!

[0.49906739592552185] We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton.
[0.49906739592552185] Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.
[0.49906739592552185] Would never stay here again and maybe not at another Hilton either.
[0.49906739592552185] Great view was the only good thing at this hotel.
[0.49906739592552185] Great value for the money we spent and not that far from airport.

[0.4893356263637543] Not a terrible place, but I have to say that I've stayed in nicer places that are less expensive.
[0.49611514806747437] The only complaint I have is the required $28 per day for parking, but this is Miami and any decent place will charge you for parking.
[0.49611514806747437] Valet parking was very pricy ($ 28) but very efficient.
[0.4962030351161957] This was an expensive option, but it was convenient since neither of us in the party was familiar with Miami.
[0.4962030351161957] When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore.
