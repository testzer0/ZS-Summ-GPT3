[0.5124024748802185] Pool sucked Cooling system was messed up (we could not control it) We stayed there 5 days and really got tired of it!
[0.5124024748802185] Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business.
[0.5124024748802185] I would call this a four star hotel that's slightly rough around the edges.

[0.4928530156612396] the hilton hotel downtown miami has the most amazing roof top pool and terrace.with stunning views over the port and miami.staff really helpful,and the rooms spacious clean and beds you just sink into.food and drink what you would expect to pay in city.pricey on overnight parking 28 dollars.but what a view of fireworks on new year.aesy to find and ideal if going on a cruise from miami port,only 5 mins drive.would recomend.
[0.4962030351161957] However the Hotel has an old feel to it and the surrounding areas outside the hotel was a bit rundown and had a grimy feel.
[0.4962030351161957] Internet connection free in the lobby, pricy in the rooms, breakfast not included.
[0.4962030351161957] The hotel needs to seriously upgrade its rooms to be in par with other establishments.
[0.4962030351161957] Excellent services clean and spacious rooms with great view of downtown Miami.Bar off lobby is a great hotel bar.We were given a bottle of champagne for our anniversary.The staff was very accommodating always smiling and engaging in conversation.

[0.49906739592552185] Housekeeping is attentive, but there can be a lot of people in the room at one time.

[0.5172679424285889] This is a very large hotel and very busy with many international guest (we overheard many languages spoken) and eventhough the staff was VERY busy they all had a great attitude and friendly demeanor.
[0.5149688124656677] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace
[0.5147485136985779] I have seen them taking pictures of and with several females no wonder prostitues hang around there.
[0.5147485136985779] I will stay at this very busy hotel again.
[0.5147485136985779] My first room was a bit noisy as it was across the hall from the vending machine, so they moved me, gladly, to the 18th floor.

[0.48241546750068665] Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards.
[0.49325111508369446] Other than the noise and kids, it was a good hotel.
[0.49325111508369446] They only give 2 free continental breakfast coupons no matter how many people you book in the room.
[0.49611514806747437] The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet!
