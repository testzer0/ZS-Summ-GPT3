[0.49906739592552185] The reviews said that the food was fine if you were a business traveler, but that it was very pricey if you were staying there for holidays.

[0.49906739592552185] The manager called and said the water was safe and we explained we did not feel comfortable bathing and brushing our teeth in green water.
[0.49906739592552185] Had a great internet deal we found on hilton.com for the website, so we were able to stay there for under $65 a night.
[0.49906739592552185] $28 in this economy??
[0.49906739592552185] Also a salad place and sandwich shop just past 19th St (hotel is on 16th).
[0.49906739592552185] Too many hobos and drug addicts!!!

[0.49611514806747437] Again conference food just ok though, damn those $16 DOJ muffins Rooms a are good, big tvs, comfy beds, nice setup.
[0.49906739592552185] Though I found the hotel very pricey (for us) I'm sure you could get a much better rate on line.
[0.49906739592552185] Since we paid $210 for the night I thought we'd get free parking - we used the valet service for $28 (plus tips) which we found pricey also.
[0.49906739592552185] We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff.
[0.49906739592552185] The food at the restaurant was excellent and the service was great.
