[0.5124024748802185] Other than the thin wall between rooms, it was an excellent stay and we'd definitely stay there again.
[0.49906739592552185] The man who was working at the front desk looked very gruff and mean, when I would ask something he made me feel like I was putting him out.

[0.49906739592552185] The lobby has a nice little living room style waiting area but only takes 10 seconds to get through to the elevators.
[0.49906739592552185] You donâ€™t walk in to a fancy lobby, but you also donâ€™t have to pay for it.
