[0.4962030351161957] Beds comfortable but the windows seemed to have drafty gaps and the air conditioning unit on it let in outside air and sound as if it was an open window.
[0.4962030351161957] I'm normally not a fan of having the bathroom sink outside of the bathroom, and not beyond a closed door, but the way they configured the room, you got the best of both worlds.
