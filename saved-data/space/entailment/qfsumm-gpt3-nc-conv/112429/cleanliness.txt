[0.49906739592552185] Staid here during Sakura-Con with a group of teens.
[0.49906739592552185] My room was warm and I discovered the fan was on, but the A/C was not.
[0.49906739592552185] The thermostat was worn so you could not tell which setting was A/C and which was heat.
[0.49906739592552185] They use energy saving compact flourescent bulbs so the room was not very bright for reading.
[0.49906739592552185] Great pricing compared to other hotels near by.
