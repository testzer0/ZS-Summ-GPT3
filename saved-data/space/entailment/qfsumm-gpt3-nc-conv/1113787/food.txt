[0.49906739592552185] The food at the hotel was not good, and one of the reviewers had to walk across the street to order food from a different restaurant.

[0.49906739592552185] Plus my husband doesn't drink and I'm 6 mths pregnant, so pretty sure we didn't access any alcohol at the mini bar.

----- Weakening -----

[0.4951927363872528] As an order of french toast was around $20 I decided to walk down the street (out the front, down one block to left, take a left and Seven Eleven was on the right) and get a donut and some milk.
[0.4958898723125458] Since the squid and quail eggs on their menu did not sound good, one of our group walked across the street to order some Food and bring it over.
[0.49611514806747437] While we will still never return to this hotel, the chef did make that evening a bit better.
[0.49906739592552185] Later that night we returned to the hotel patio and wanted a simple meal.
[0.49906739592552185] On a side note, the executive chef of the restaurant did come out to see us and was the only pleasant person we spoke to.
