[0.5174932479858398] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[0.49906739592552185] I stopped into Charlie Palmer for dinner, had a fantastic time there, Tommy the bartender took great care of me and the food was out of this world.
[0.49906739592552185] Wish the weather had been nice enough to use the pool.
[0.49906739592552185] Back to the Penthouse...what a view of Dallas, both at night with all the lights and then again in the morning when we met for breakfast.
[0.49906739592552185] our names, what we liked, everyone congratulated us on our anniversary!

[0.49906739592552185] There is a Neiman Marcus and a decent Mexican restaurant next door, but there's also a boarded up building.
[0.49906739592552185] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.
[0.49906739592552185] My stay at the Magnolia around the corner for the preceding two nights was far more pleasant for $150 less a night.

[0.49906739592552185] There are a lot of office buildings around, but the place really seems to die down after 5 PM.
