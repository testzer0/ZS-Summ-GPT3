----- Supporting -----

[0.530825138092041] It was a nice hotel, but I would recommend staying closer to the center of activities.
[0.5287833213806152] The location couldn't have been better.
[0.5262777209281921] What a great location for a visit to Toronto!

[0.5253459811210632] The location couldn't be better.

----- Weakening -----

[0.4795551896095276] This makes it an ideal location for vacationers, but a bit far if you have meetings in the main business district in the downtown core (although it's not too bad for that).
[0.48222747445106506] The location was an excellent one for us because our event was just across the street, but we also walked to dinner on Queen Street, had many shopping choices (itâ€™s connected to the Eaton Centre, or you can meander along funky Queen West) and itâ€™s close to the subway.
[0.48241546750068665] One restaurant that you must visit - if you are interested in Italian food - is Terroni.
[0.48500627279281616] Had drinks and apps in restaurant/lounge...nice atmosphere overlooking courtyard.
[0.4864966869354248] I did not have an opportunity to use the recreation facilities but the location of the hotel is ideal.

[0.5124024748802185] My only negative comment about the room was the view - it looked straight into an adjacent office building.
[0.49906739592552185] The valets recommended cheap indoor parking in the office building next door.
[0.49906739592552185] The location canâ€™t be beat, youâ€™re right in the heart of the city, right next to the Eaton Centre and steps away from the hive of Dundas Square.
[0.49906739592552185] The hop on/hop off bus stop was very close to the hotel and so was the drop off spot for the airport shuttle which was great.
[0.49906739592552185] Lots of stores and restaurants in the area.

[0.49906739592552185] It enters sears, and on your way through this hallway there is a giftshop and a cafe down the stairs.
