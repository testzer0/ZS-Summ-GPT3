[0.49906739592552185] I wasn't in any particular hurry, but just am not used to waiting for hot water these days.
[0.49906739592552185] And for this we paid fancy hotel restaurant prices - ugh!
[0.49906739592552185] I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.

[0.49906739592552185] There are 3 and 4 star hotels just down the street from this one, and half the price.
[0.49906739592552185] It think it may also be the most expensive of all of the Toronto Marriott hotels.
[0.49906739592552185] Concierge lounge nibbles in the evening were a little disappointing, but the staff were friendly (I think this area used to be the old steak house).
[0.49906739592552185] If the price was right, I would go back.
[0.49906739592552185] The prices are way to high for what you get... a room.
