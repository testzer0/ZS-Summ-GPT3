[0.49906739592552185] The rooms at this hotel are well-done and up to Marriott's usual standards, but they are not luxurious.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5276996493339539] Clean modern rooms, reasonably good service, excellent concierge, good restaurant.
[0.5246475338935852] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.
[0.5223049521446228] Decent, but small 18th floor pool and gym overlooking the City.
[0.5223049521446228] Room was clean but small- could say the same about the pool!

----- Weakening -----

[0.47732821106910706] The rooms are spacious and beds very comfortable, unfortunately there was no bottled water in the room which was disappointing given the hotel standard but this is my only downside of the stay.
[0.47863951325416565] This is a renovated Marriott with an above average lobby and room.
[0.47863951325416565] Overrall, my room was a comfortable place to spend some time (I liked the large flat panel tv), while the rest of the hotel was unexciting.
[0.48131152987480164] The room was typically Marriott - very nice, great view of the Church and gardens in between the Eaton Centre.
[0.4814993441104889] Had all standard amenities including coffee maker and fridge and robes .

[0.49906739592552185] There were some issues with the phone system not working in some of the rooms.

[0.5288293361663818] A few minutes later this person came to my room and handed me a key to another room that happened to have its line fixed already for that night.
[0.5173357725143433] Plenty of options for dinner around Dundas square.
[0.5119321346282959] Itâ€™s probably a 20-minute walk (rough guess and depends how fast you walk) to the Harbour Front with loads of restaurants (I ate at the Watermark Irish Pub).
[0.510872483253479] There are tons of excellent restaurants close by for pretty much every taste and budget.
[0.5040923357009888] Our in-room safe wasn't working properly, but that was corrected while we went out for an afternoon exploration of Toronto.

----- Weakening -----

[0.4962030351161957] I was happy to get this hotel for $159/night - though internet was slow and added $16 dollars per day (though it included all calls - or so i thought until i got my bill and they had charged me $40 worth of long distance calls - they were promptly removed).
[0.4981500506401062] It means breakfast on the last day is either cash of charge card.
[0.4981500506401062] The shower however was very touchy and the water was either scalding hot or very cold.
[0.49906739592552185] I thought that was OK, so I accepted the room and settled in.
[0.49906739592552185] The room itself was up to Marriott's usual standards - well done, not over-the-top luxurious, but very nice.
