[0.3459663391113281] Large room, with really nice and comfy duvets, and overall much nicer than I've seen from most hotels in Toronto in this price range.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9972789287567139] The room was so filthy, we decided to leave, and find another hotel.
[-0.9971163272857666] The rooms are tired with many defects (both my rooms had faults including bulbs out, loose headboard and loose bathroom fittings.
[-0.9959731101989746] The hotel was dirty.
[-0.9956977367401123] Exhausted, we walked into our room, and experienced the most overwhelming foul smells, I canâ€™t even describe!
[-0.9956579208374023] Nothing in the room felt clean and I agree with one reviewer that the bed "crunched".

**********

[0.59136962890625] The views from the rooms are great, and the hotel has all the amenities that guests need.

----- Supporting -----

[0.59136962890625] The rooms were spacious with queen sized beds, nice bathrooms, the view was decent out of our 5th floor rooms, and we had no real issues at all as far as the hotel went.
[0.4480743408203125] Staff was extra friendly, room was large and clean, had a great view of the city and we were walking distance to just about everything.
[0.426666259765625] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
[0.18209075927734375] This is a decent hotel, but factor in the low prices, great location and little perks like free wi-fi, and I'd say that it's one of the best I've stayed in.
[0.18106460571289062] The staff was very polite, rooms were clean, and the hotel has a great location.

[-0.9888982772827148] None of the 'perks' of the hotel were available-pool, steam room, gym, and the TV was old and hardly worked.
[-0.9885039329528809] The room was so filthy, we decided to leave, and find another hotel.
[-0.9850747585296631] We are heartbroken and will never recommend this hotel to anyone.
[-0.9800765514373779] I've stayed in many places around the world but this was the worst.
[-0.9775865077972412] The Primrose is a dated property offering only basic levels of service.

**********

[0.20843505859375] The only complaint is that there is no room service.

----- Supporting -----

[0.20843505859375] There was a 'restaurant' that never did open the three days, two nights we stayed and no room service.
[-0.0017576217651367188] Other than that, we were most pleased with the hotel and hope to return again on our 40th.
[-0.0030748844146728516] Nice Hotel.
[-0.0031652450561523438] The Primrose is a good hotel for people who plan on staying just a few dates in Toronto and plan on only sleeping there.
[-0.003305673599243164] My friends and I decided to stay at this hotel for two nights because the price was so good.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9870762825012207] Room serviced daily.
[-0.9847421646118164] The biggest disappointments were: -Elevators (being "updated", bumpy ride, not reliable-ended up on a floor we didn't know we could access!)
[-0.9753570556640625] The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage.
[-0.9629302024841309] 2) Our favorite bottle of wine is waiting for us in the room 3) Reservations are made at our favorite restauraunt 4) Staff know us by our first names 5) My wife gets a birthday email on her birthday 6) The staff truly feels like family TRY THIS hOTEL you wont be disapointed!
[-0.9615478515625] A few very minor complaints - the bathroom was very small and a bit cold, since the only heat was from a small baseboard heater.
