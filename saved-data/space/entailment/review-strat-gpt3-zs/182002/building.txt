[-0.003875732421875] The hotel is located in a city that is unknown to many people.

----- Supporting -----

[-0.003875732421875] We were lost in a city we HAD never been in for 10 mintues during the night.
[-0.032382965087890625] The beds were comfortable and the sheets good quality but the furniture is pretty dated and the bathroom very tired looking.
[-0.04643058776855469] There aren't many facilities and the internet in my room cut out once in a while.
[-0.07794380187988281] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!
