[0.0264434814453125] According to the reviews, the hotel is located in a decent area, but the parking situation is not ideal.

----- Supporting -----

[0.0264434814453125] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.020597457885742188] I would stay here again but I would park elsewhere.
[0.0083770751953125] The underground parking is horribly laid out.
[0.00716400146484375] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.0067577362060546875] If you have a van or larger vehicle forget parking here.

[0.711517333984375] There have been reports of cars being broken into when parked in the recommended spot.

----- Supporting -----

[0.711517333984375] I couldn't believe they were trying to stick me for a charge when I hadn't been able to park in the garage, the spot was supposed to be free, the spot was recommended by the hotel staff, AND my car was broken into while parked there.
[0.0028228759765625] The next day when we moved into the garage the attendant said we should never have parked in the previous location because everyone should know that your car would be a target there.
[-0.0020699501037597656] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.

[0.20619964599609375] The window looking at a fantastic view north was so grimy it was hard to see through (finger and nose prints all over it) We just kept the net curtains closed so we couldn't see them and enjoyed the night lights instead.
[0.16539764404296875] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).

[0.0987548828125] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.08910369873046875] Its really tight down there, but there is also a public lot outside which you can use.
[0.07018280029296875] To get to the parking lot from the guest floors you will need to use an access card in the elevators; if you are not quick enough, or your card doesn't work properly, you will find that you are called to another floor.
[0.03172922134399414] The underground parking is horribly laid out.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7864761352539062] Location is very central.
[-0.27420997619628906] The subway station is only a few blocks away and the street car passes right in front of the hotel.

[0.6323394775390625] Before checking in, they rudely told us that the parking space we had requested had been given to someone else and that we were to go down the street to public parking lot.
[0.08538818359375] We then checked in and were told that the parking garage was full and that I could park on the street.
[0.048248291015625] It was full when I got there and had to get a "pass" to park in the employees parking lot in the back alley!
[0.00379180908203125] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
