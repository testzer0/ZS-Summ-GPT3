----- Supporting -----

[0.9907193183898926] It was about fifteen minutes away from town and very close to the airport.
[0.0046596527099609375] Airport pickup runs every 15 minutes.
[0.0046138763427734375] It is an easy drive into downtown Seattle from here and worked great for my late-arriving flight before meetings in Seattle the following morning.
[0.0030422210693359375] It has a convenient location and a shuttle service that runs every 15 minutes for 24 hours.
[0.002208709716796875] Very conveinient for early morning flights.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7814273834228516] This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking.
[-0.34613609313964844] I can see paying parking for a downtown hotel - but for a hotel at Sea-Tac it seemed absurd to have to pay parking.
[-0.3425140380859375] It is on a busy street and I didn't see a restaurant within walking distance so I ate in the lobby.
[-0.33093738555908203] Our room was connected to the main lobby by a skyway; we were in building 5 -- it wasn't very close.
[-0.3186607360839844] We stayed in the village part of the hotel, which were found to be old and dark.

[0.945404052734375] There is a parking fee, as well as a parking tax.

----- Supporting -----

[0.945404052734375] We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee.
[0.9440937042236328] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[0.9379692077636719] :) The only complaint is - parking for overnight cost $16, and on top of that, we had $1.40 of tax!!!
[0.9239215850830078] Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax.
[0.25981903076171875] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8316001892089844] Free shuttle to the airport got us to the terminal in about 3 minutes!
[-0.5871639251708984] Free shuttle to and from airport helps.

[-0.4077129364013672] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
[-0.3752899169921875] We were tired and against Trip Advisor's advice we went to the restaurant at the hotel for a late night snack.

[0.05133628845214844] The location is convenient for those flying in or out of Sea-Tac airport, but the views from the rooms are unimpressive.

----- Supporting -----

[0.05133628845214844] --Rooms have a small deck, but the view is of the airport - nothing spectacular.
[0.0007171630859375] Saw shuttle pass us along the way ;-( Still, LIKE the location and the cookies ;-)

[-0.6573009490966797] We were told we had a great view of the "lake" from our room.
[-0.421478271484375] Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed watching airplanes takeoff and land, and this hotel provides an eagle's eye view of the airport (unless you're on the east side of the tower, in which case you're stuck looking at the snowcapped Cascades and/or Mt Rainier).

**********

[0.9747381210327148] My only complaint about this hotel was the charge for parking.
[0.9687461853027344] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.574554443359375] Valet parking was very quick and hassle free.
[-0.54583740234375] On the downside, I just recently tried to make a reservation for another night with my husband, and they want to charge $10 for the second person.
[-0.5345458984375] We get the stay and jet package so we park for a week for only $30.00.
