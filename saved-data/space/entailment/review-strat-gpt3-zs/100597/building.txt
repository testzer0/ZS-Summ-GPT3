[0.010304450988769531] The building's exterior is uninviting, and the front desk staff is unprofessional and unhelpful.

[-0.09252548217773438] This is a large property with (I believe) five buildings.
[-0.09383392333984375] The exterior of the buildings in these wings looks like some outdated Polynesian tiki architecture.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9947645664215088] I went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and I had what I needed - nice touch.
[-0.9854516983032227] There is an abundance of gardens in between the different buildings and all were very well maintained and tended.
[-0.9818501472473145] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
[-0.9644339084625244] It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.
[-0.9633402824401855] The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms.
