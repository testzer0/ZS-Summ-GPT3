[-0.9600830078125] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9402456283569336] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.5464248657226562] I had two problems with this place, first when I arrived home the day of our last stay I reviewed the invoice which had been emailed to me and was charged $202.00 for a dinner at Charlie Palmers, but we never dined at Charlie Palmers.
[-0.4572601318359375] The doorman refused to allow us entry and we ended up waiting for almost an hour in the Texas heat while other folks would simply walk off the street and were immediately allowed in!
[-0.3486747741699219] Well let me start by stating, Tripadvisor isn't such a friendly review system.
