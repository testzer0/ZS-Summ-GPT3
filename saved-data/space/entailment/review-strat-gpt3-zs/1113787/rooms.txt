[0.05322265625] The rooms were clean, but some guests felt they were overpriced.

----- Supporting -----

[0.05322265625] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
[0.0513458251953125] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".
[0.04280853271484375] Our tweens loved the salt water heated infinity pool, the Charlie Palmer bar, awesome room service and gorgeous room......we live in Carrollton, but felt we had traveled to another luxurious country!
[0.03973388671875] I would say for us, it was beyond luxury!
[0.03679656982421875] The hotel is gorgeous and our room was clean, modern, and just as I expected a Luxury Starwood Hotel should be.

[-0.10304832458496094] They have a special lunch that includes a soup, salad and half sandwich that's quick and inexpensive.
[-0.09421539306640625] AND the pool was closed for a "photo shoot" that took up the whole pool for a majority of the afternoon.
[-0.057590484619140625] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.05445098876953125] I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.

[0.9383125305175781] other than that the bathroom is not very private so if you want to preserve the "romance" factor you'll need to make a trip to the lobby because the ballroom level restroom is kept locked.
