[0.8215370178222656] We are NOT demanding restaurant a patrons, but both the food and the service was poor.
[0.5388259887695312] Concierge lounge nibbles in the evening were a little disappointing, but the staff were friendly (I think this area used to be the old steak house).
[0.49533843994140625] I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.
[0.203277587890625] Food presentation was fancy, but the food didn't taste very good.
[0.08489990234375] When my husband's Cesar salad was served with chicken instead of salmon, he had to hunt down the waiter to point out the problem, and the waiter barely seemed to care.

[0.4505615234375] Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.

[-0.5470199584960938] I got a discounted rate because I am a Marriott rewards member which made it worth it.
[-0.253173828125] There are 3 and 4 star hotels just down the street from this one, and half the price.
[-0.11083984375] On each occasion I paid about $175 Canadian/night for the room (wouldn't pay a lot more for it).If shopping is not a top priority, there are probably more convenient locations for tourists to stay, but if you want to do some serious shopping, this is the place to stay.
