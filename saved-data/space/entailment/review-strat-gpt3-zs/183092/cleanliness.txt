[-0.0075130462646484375] A previous time, we had booked thru travelocity or some website, but accidentally booked two rooms instead of one, because of apparent excess clicking.
[-0.007542610168457031] Stayed from August 3rd to 5th with two friends for Caribana Weekend; booked on Expedia at the last minute so I was a bit worried, but the price was fair, so I figured I'd take what I got.
