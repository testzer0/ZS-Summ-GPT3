[0.8754959106445312] The reviewers thought that the building was in need of refurbishment.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8754959106445312] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[0.1005706787109375] The lobby refurb looked great -- now they just need to tackle some of the older rooms.
[0.03438568115234375] Think it's in real need of refurbishment.
[-7.62939453125e-06] They also really need more than 1 elevator to the parking garage.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.6762332916259766] The lobby was modern with a beautiful fireplace and a good breafast/coffee/drinks bar too.
[-0.4715137481689453] We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.
[-0.42302989959716797] In addition to being spacious, the lobby was decorated in a modern fashion with booth-like check-in desk, complete with a very professional and courteous staff who checked us in promptly.
[-0.3957328796386719] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!
[-0.3568706512451172] Modern facility, quiet.

[-0.0107574462890625] My only advice is to ask for a room opposite the construction side...
[-0.01311492919921875] and said that I really needed to do some work on my computer and I asked whether they could not speed up the repair on the line.

[-0.9895060062408447] It has a lovely, light lobby filled with professionals who are friendly and helpful!

[0.025248050689697266] The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated, but there is only one elevator to the parking garage, which can cause long wait times.

----- Supporting -----

[0.025248050689697266] The wait for an elevator to the parking garage was quite long.

[-0.0007038116455078125] Great lobby to hang out in.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8289546966552734] One small window that didn't open.
[-0.29152870178222656] Its a pretty cool thing to be able to walk right into torontos biggest mall in just two minutes.
[-0.22167205810546875] Only downside was at 2am someone decided to light a cigarette in a stairwell and set off the smoke alarm causing all of the hotel guests to be evacuated.
[-0.10274505615234375] Under that mall is the subway station, so you can actually get on the subway without ever going outside.
[-0.07079696655273438] Bonus, no need to go out with a coat since the Marriott has indoor access to the Eaton Center...Shoppers Heaven for sure!!!

[0.9871401786804199] There have also been false fire alarms, which are disconcerting.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9871401786804199] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
[0.001247406005859375] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!
[0.0011310577392578125] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[-0.00110626220703125] Had some idiot pull fire alarm at 4 am on Sunday, but was resolved within 30 minutes and not having to evacuate.

----- Supporting -----

[0.34395790100097656] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!
