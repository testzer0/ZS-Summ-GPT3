[0.663330078125] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[0.15237045288085938] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[-0.0030975341796875] *The art in the rooms are old and are of Delta, why not GI?
[-0.012241840362548828] You do have a art institute across the road.

[-0.019967079162597656] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
