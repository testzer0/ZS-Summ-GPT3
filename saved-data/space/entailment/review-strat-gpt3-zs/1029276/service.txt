[0.09465408325195312] Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all.
[0.0703887939453125] I enjoyed staying here but I don't understand why there isn't free internet like in all other hotels I stayed in during my 3-week vacation.
