----- Supporting -----

[0.05304718017578125] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!
[0.0239410400390625] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.0034494400024414062] The location was good, very close to the Bayside area and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach.
[0.0027141571044921875] Relaxing versus the 24 hour party going on at South Beach (though that was great as well).
[0.0025491714477539062] But other than that, not a bad place to stay.
