[0.024394989013671875] The reviews said that the cleanliness of the hotel was average.

----- Supporting -----

[0.024394989013671875] It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.
[-0.008489608764648438] My companion and I stayed at this hotel because it was one of the most affordable on the day we went.
[-0.00931549072265625] I ended up with a very early morning arrival flight, and hoped that the hotel would hold my bags until check in since I had a meeting at 11am... they let me check into my room at 9:30am!
[-0.015489578247070312] Now, a few drawbacks - the hotel charges $9.95/day for wifi, does any other motel/hotel anywhere do that anymore?
[-0.01578521728515625] The Dragonfish Sushi is right in the hotel downstairs.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9624872207641602] The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the decor in good taste (lots of texture, neutral tone, and rich burgandy to soothe the spirit).
[-0.9616155624389648] The decor was cool and modern.
[-0.8917856216430664] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[-0.8650722503662109] It's Asian inspired and they have some incredible little dishes of sushi and japanese type dishes.
[-0.8423538208007812] I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.

[0.014410018920898438] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[-0.00360107421875] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
[-0.00435638427734375] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.523284912109375] - The housekeeper walked in on me without knocking at 9 a.m. in the morning when I was getting ready to go in the shower.
[-0.4816570281982422] It's Asian inspired and they have some incredible little dishes of sushi and japanese type dishes.
[-0.39031219482421875] The best thing is they have an empty fridge so you can put all your goodies that you buy from pike place inside

[-0.474212646484375] I had Sake for $1.
[-0.42490386962890625] Don't know the concierges name, it would be the older man in the morning but he had great recommendations for restaurants, each one excellent and was so knowledgeable about the city and when was the best times to go to events.

[0.14410400390625] Overall, it seems that the cleanliness of the hotel is somewhat hit or miss.

----- Supporting -----

[0.14410400390625] It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.
[0.1015625] The thermostat was worn so you could not tell which setting was A/C and which was heat.

[0.0565643310546875] Wi-fi, however, was spotty in strength, and I frequently had difficulty maintaining a connection.

[0.0083770751953125] Great pricing compared to other hotels near by.
[0.00827789306640625] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).

[0.7027530670166016] The only complaint about cleanliness was that the fitness center was in the basement and felt a little dungeon-like.

[0.7027530670166016] The only thing I didn't care for was the fitness center, which was sort of a dungeon in the basement.
[0.021511077880859375] The only aspect of the hotel that could be improved, in my opinion, is the fitness center -- it's in the basement and has older equipment.

[-0.6021003723144531] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[-0.5896453857421875] The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.
[-0.5654659271240234] They use energy saving compact flourescent bulbs so the room was not very bright for reading.
