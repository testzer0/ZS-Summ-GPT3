[0.15952301025390625] The rooms are suspect for making people ill.

----- Supporting -----

[0.15952301025390625] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[0.1034698486328125] The biggest issue is that upon going to bed the first night, I noticed an overpowering smell of urine in my bed.
[0.03926849365234375] I stayed for 5 nights and by the 5th night I was dreadfully ill.
[0.0330657958984375] The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.
[0.024139404296875] The room is shabby, the shower made a horrible noise whenever the water was running.
