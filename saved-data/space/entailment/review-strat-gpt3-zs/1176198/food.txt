[-0.5632686614990234] The only thing i would not recommend is eating at the hotel; with as many restaurants nearby, go out.
[-0.01467132568359375] I really don't have anything bad to say about this hotel, the price is a little steep per night but it is definitely worth it.
[-0.004241943359375] Tons of little restaurants, small shops (not big retail stores), kind of an artsy feel.
[-0.0040283203125] There's good coffee nearby (I'm fairly sure that they didn't offer breakfast).
[-0.001129150390625] It would be great to see more cream in the room in future.
