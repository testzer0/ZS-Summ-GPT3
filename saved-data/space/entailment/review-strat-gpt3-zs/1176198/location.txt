[0.10844802856445312] The first review said that the location was not as close as the rental agency said it would be, and that the reviewer's back got worse as a result.

[-0.007843017578125] Will stay at the real Hilton the next time!
[-0.008134841918945312] So it would have been much safer and cheaper to park the car at the hotel.
[-0.009357452392578125] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.
[-0.009840011596679688] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.

[-0.07742500305175781] Another thing is try to avoid the public parking across the hotel.
[-0.074127197265625] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[-0.06482887268066406] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!
[-0.03666496276855469] If you have a car, consider the cost of parking.
[-0.028995513916015625] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.

[0.1869182586669922] The reviewers said that the location was not that great because it was hard to find a parking spot and the staff was not very helpful.

[0.1869182586669922] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!
[0.1095428466796875] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended
[0.008380889892578125] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[0.0081787109375] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
[0.005680084228515625] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.

[0.4776611328125] The location is good for some attractions, but it is not the nicest area of town and it is next to a noisy nightclub.

----- Supporting -----

[0.4776611328125] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!

[0.15203857421875] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.06432342529296875] BUT ..... there is a new night club beside the hotel called "Tryst" .... needless to say it is techno music and it is all you can hear until about 3:00 in the morning ... especially in the summer when they have their patio open and are projecting video's on the side of the building.
[0.0135498046875] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.

[-0.8999738693237305] There was an event on at the nightclub one night and I never heard anything.
[-0.8246688842773438] Fantastic location (OK they are renewing the old fashion district in the downtown core) but this hotel is quite wonderful !
[-0.6879978179931641] Surrounded by lots of restaurants and two less than two blocks from great shopping.
[-0.6680564880371094] The hotel is close enough to the big attractions to be convenient but still is not in an overly busy/loud part of town which was nice.
[-0.5627555847167969] It's right in the middle of the entertainment district which means you are near everything.

[0.8252930641174316] The hotel is centrally located and easy to walk to many attractions.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8252930641174316] The hotel is in a good location, central and easy to walk from - the Art Gallery of Ontario is well worth a visit.
[0.8092079162597656] This hotel is in walking distance to most of the downtown attractions such as the CN Tower, Queen St, Front St, even Wayne Gretzky's restaurant is right down the street.
[0.588470458984375] The hotel location is ideal for a visitor to the city, within easy walking distance of the entertainment district, the business district, and great shopping and dining.
[0.5410385131835938] The hotel is very conveniently located to the nearby entertainment district, and 20 min walk to the island ferries, and is convenient to the Queen and King Streetcar lines if you wish to go further.
[0.4401082992553711] We were visiting our children in Toronto and found the Garden Inn Downtown centrally located for every place we needed to be.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8777523040771484] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[-0.7308845520019531] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[-0.6328239440917969] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.
[-0.6035385131835938] Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.
[-0.5811080932617188] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.
