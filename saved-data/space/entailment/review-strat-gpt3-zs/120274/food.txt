[-4.100799560546875e-05] Often all the tables would be full and the bread was often finished before the breakfast session finished.
[-7.724761962890625e-05] They offered Frosted Flakes, and Wheat Bread (with a toaster) as our choices.
[-0.00037670135498046875] There are a zillion places to eat along the 192, Ponderosa is great for it's huge buffet breakfast and filling up before a day at the parks.
