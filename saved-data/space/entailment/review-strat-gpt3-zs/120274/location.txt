----- Supporting -----

[0.0513153076171875] Upon arriving at the motel I was asked to pay the resort fee which I knew about and indeed most of the motels charge this or charge you for the safe in your room which amounts to around the same thing.
[0.007274627685546875] Upon arrival, we had to pay an additional "resort fee" of 97c per room per day, which covered the safe and pool usage etc, but having paid only £19 per room per night, we didn't really complain at that.
