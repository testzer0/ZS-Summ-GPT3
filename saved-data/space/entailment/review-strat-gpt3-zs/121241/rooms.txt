[0.056705474853515625] Some guests were disappointed with the pool, finding it cold.

----- Supporting -----

[0.056705474853515625] We went to the first pool room the hot tub was not hot at all it was very cold and it was blowing out cold water, the pool was alittle bit cold.
[0.01045989990234375] Pool was VERY cold, though, so he couldn't stay in for very long periods of time.
[0.008800506591796875] We headed to the pool.....yuck!
[0.0085906982421875] Also, neither of the pools were working while we were there.
[0.00220489501953125] We then went to the 2nd pool room the hot tub was hot and the pool was still kinda cold.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.910487174987793] The pool room is very warm and it appeared we would be in there all by ourselves.
[-0.8756246566772461] One room was very warm.
[-0.81085205078125] At first when I saw this big, magnificent hoteI that looked like a castle I thought that it would be way too much to stay there.
[-0.7763309478759766] Since it was so hot during our stay, in the 100's, the indoor pool was very inviting.
[-0.7607860565185547] My teenage boy and girl were with us and really enjoyed the pools and the hot tubs.
