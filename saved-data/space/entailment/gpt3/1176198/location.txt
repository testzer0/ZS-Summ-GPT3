[0.5502564311027527] We parked our car and never looked back because everything was within walking distance.
[0.5454317331314087] You can self-park but being right downtown I figured it wasn't worth the hassle to save a few bucks.
[0.5454317331314087] From the airport got a car that seated 5 people and luggage and cost $65 which we didn't think was too bad - took about 25 minutes.
[0.5454317331314087] It is not that hard to match up numbers on tickets to find a vehicle.
[0.5447041392326355] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.

[0.5313035249710083] When we asked where the nearest self park ramp was, no one had a clue!
[0.5313035249710083] They don't keep change in the restaurant!!!
[0.533881664276123] The hotel has Valet parking only which is fine since you can walk to everything.
