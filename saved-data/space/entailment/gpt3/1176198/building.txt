[0.5378588438034058] The building is new and has a lovely lobby.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5488782525062561] The place is brand new so everything works just fine.
[0.5378588438034058] As we arrived, I was wondering why the front desk girl was all rushed while we were the only ones checking in.
[0.5378588438034058] The lobby is also small.
[0.5378588438034058] The hall was a bit noisy the first night because there were a lot of young adults staying there that night, but they finally quieted down.
[0.5378588438034058] I did hear them but maybe I just expect that city hum, having grown up in NY.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5313035249710083] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[0.5313035249710083] Nice lobby with fresh cookies in the evening.
[0.5361506938934326] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[0.5378588438034058] How easy could it have been for someone else to leave with our truck if they could bring us the wrong car?
[0.5378588438034058] (once we figured out how to work all the shower heads) The walls were very thin though-we could really hear our neighbours mini party at 2AM in the morning.

[0.5426965951919556] We had to rent a car and travel back to US to have key made.
[0.5397157669067383] The only bad things that i can mention are that during my stay another guest decided to set the fire alarm of at 04:30, not a wake up call I want to repeat.

[0.5316861271858215] There were weird grease marks on the wall as well.
