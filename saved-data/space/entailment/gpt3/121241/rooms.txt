[0.5313035249710083] Between shows, we enjoyed an indoor pool and the hot tub.
[0.5313035249710083] The pool had a enough towels available so you did not have to use your ones from your room.
[0.5313035249710083] The pool room is very warm and it appeared we would be in there all by ourselves.

[0.5426965951919556] The rooms were clean, bathroom is extremely small and crowded, barely enough room to turn around.
[0.5413144826889038] The first thing I noticed is the hallways were very dark even in daytime.
[0.5388916730880737] We enjoyed our stay here very much - did not like the wooden floors because early in the mornings, we could hear creaks as the people above us moved around.

[0.5314888954162598] When you opened the door it came within one inch or so of the toilet, but again, that was not a problem for us, just something to be aware of.
[0.5378588438034058] The Settle Inn was very kid friendly.

[0.5313035249710083] While the mom shops till she drops, the little girls and I always enjoy the huge indoor pool and hot tub no matter what the seasons brings outside.
[0.5313035249710083] My Son was very young at the time and wanted to stay there as he liked knights and horses and they have statues of them at the entrance and inside the building, We decided to humor ourselves and stop by and see how much a room would be and we found that it was quite affordable and had many extras to offer.
[0.5313035249710083] We were so plesed with the outside look of the hotel and just as plesed with our rooms.
