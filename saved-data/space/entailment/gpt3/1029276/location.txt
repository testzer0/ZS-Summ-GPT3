[0.5378588438034058] The location was praised by some for its proximity to the ocean, Bayside Plaza, and the Metromover.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5502564311027527] Aside from the convenient location to the MetroMover, which was all we needed to get to the bayside station.
[0.5475785136222839] Bayside Plaza is a short taxi ride away which is a lot of fun especially on Super Bowl week end and the Metromover is just a block away which gives access to Metrorail.
[0.5466598272323608] The location was good, very close to the Bayside area and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach.
[0.5454317331314087] The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun.
[0.5454317331314087] Hotel was convenient to and from Miami airport via SuperShuttle ($16 to and from here) and to cruise ship at nearby port.

[0.5340682864189148] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!
[0.5378588438034058] The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet!
[0.5378588438034058] And it is a very lovely place.
[0.5378588438034058] Excursions booked via hotel consierge could only be paid for with cash.

[0.5378588438034058] However, others found the location to be inconvenient and lacking in local amenities.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5413144826889038] Unless you have a rental car, you're at the mercy of taxis to find an interesting neighborhood since this one is so bland.
[0.5413144826889038] The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace.
[0.5410817861557007] On-site restaurant was simply okay, surrounding neighborhood was very blah, and the staff was ambivalent.
[0.5378588438034058] We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton.
[0.5378588438034058] Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5313035249710083] When were assigned a new room the keys didn't work so we had to go back to have them activated.
[0.5313035249710083] The only drawback is that near by the hotel you do not have any life, and the park option is expensive 28 usd.
[0.5314888954162598] The location is not that good for the regular tourist with no car but a Metromover station is nearby.
[0.534305214881897] Being downtown the hotel is a bit lacking in local amenities.
[0.534305214881897] No bar fridge in the room if you want to keep something cold.

[0.5378588438034058] The location was not ideal for some, while others found it convenient.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5475785136222839] We did not make the breakfast because of the race timing, but the welcome reception was very nice.
[0.5475272536277771] Only the view from the hotel room made it worthwhile for me.
[0.5466598272323608] I accepted since the only reason I stayed at this Hilton was for a good nights sleep while starting a family vacation.
[0.5461652278900146] When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore.
[0.5454317331314087] We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton.

[0.5313035249710083] The Hotel is good - the location is not.
[0.5313035249710083] Location is walkable to the Arsht Center, American Airlines Arena, and Bayside, but you would need a taxi/car for anything else.
[0.5318782925605774] This was an expensive option, but it was convenient since neither of us in the party was familiar with Miami.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5426965951919556] Location is a little awkward to enter due to road construction.
[0.5426965951919556] One other note..the restaurant in the hotel is nice but the waiters are drenched in cologne so that is all you smell and taste.
[0.5413144826889038] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.
[0.5378588438034058] We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton.

[0.5366135835647583] Fantastic view from 19th floor.

[0.5486461520195007] Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.
[0.5475272536277771] Although - taking a tip from a previous poster - dine at the Bistro - 1/2 price on some of the appetizers and reasonably priced sandwiches.
[0.5470333695411682] There is a Checkers and a Burger king across the street.
[0.5454317331314087] I also had great meals in the restuarant with good quality and service delivered by the staff.
[0.5430249571800232] We also wanted to go out for dinner(the snacks in the lounge weren't enough for the kids)so he recommended a very good restaurant near the bay area and he even called there and made us a reservation so we didn't have to wait for the line.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5405172109603882] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.5388916730880737] Relaxing versus the 24 hour party going on at South Beach (though that was great as well).

[0.5362030863761902] nearby the Bayside arena and a short drive to Miami Beach (art Deco).

[0.5423060655593872] Valet parking was over $25.
[0.5399306416511536] One more note parking is 28 per day, and internet 10 bucks for 24 hrs - again something expected in a downtown major city ..no real place to park otherwise, so this may be the only option, or cab it..

[0.5266469120979309] High parking rates unless you get park & stay AAA rate (I did).

[0.5253061056137085] One of the downsides to this motel is the location.
[0.5314888954162598] As we had a car ,the location was not a problem.South Beach is just a short drive across the bridge and we took a taxi to Bayside.We ordered room service for breakfast and it was excellent.
[0.5314888954162598] The location is not that good for the regular tourist with no car but a Metromover station is nearby.
[0.5316861271858215] I'd suggest Hilton put a few dollars into a rehab.
[0.5326252579689026] The only downfall is that the hotel could have been in a better area.
