----- Supporting -----

[0.5502564311027527] The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
[0.5429357886314392] HOUSEKEEPING: Never understood that there were 4 people in the room (room can hold 5) and choose to only put towels for 3 each day we were day (4 days) despite many calls to the front desk.
[0.5426965951919556] not a good way to start New Years eve having to share towels.
[0.5426965951919556] The A/C, as mentioned elsewhere here, is very loud.
[0.5426965951919556] The valet was efficient and always had our car available when we exited the elevator.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5313035249710083] Some fun decor and some oldish.
[0.5353567600250244] The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it.
[0.5361506938934326] One or two issues during our stay included :- Housekeeping - at least 2 days out of the 5 our room was not made up and we had to chase housekeeping.
[0.5366135835647583] Just based on prior experience I thought that the next morning we would be scrambling for cabs so I got downstairs a little early.
[0.5366135835647583] Wifi struggles at times, nerd heavy conferences will be rough.

[0.5426996946334839] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.
[0.5378588438034058] They gave us continental vouchers.
[0.5378588438034058] We woke up to no vouchers under our door and had to call and explain a couple more times the situation.
[0.5378588438034058] When we arrived the valet guys seemed like they had nothing better to do than harass us.
[0.5378588438034058] WIFI is not free either.

[0.5378588438034058] I would hope that there would be a cerfew and expectations of adult supervision in the future as I got little sleep as a result of the noise.
[0.5378588438034058] My only reccomendation would be providing free WiFi connection up in the rooms.not only at the lobby.
