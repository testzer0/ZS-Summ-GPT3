[0.5378588438034058] The hotel could do with a refurbishment, and there is construction happening on the exterior and in the lobby.

[0.5433233380317688] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.
[0.5427488684654236] And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor.

[0.5313035249710083] Also lots of construction on the streets make sure you plan to leave a bit early especially on the weekend.
[0.5363357663154602] VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.

[0.5378588438034058] We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier.
[0.5378588438034058] The renovations were the least of our worries.

[0.5378588438034058] The central fire station is located a few blocks down from this hotel.
[0.5378588438034058] We finally got to the lobby and due to the many marathon guests, it was busy.
[0.5378588438034058] But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking.
