[0.5549203753471375] I think the smell people are saying is probably the same you get in your car when you switch it off for a bit.
[0.5523480176925659] In fact they still have the same bedcovers and carpets going by the photos that have been submitted.
[0.5514822602272034] They looked like the towels my mechanic uses at his shop.
[0.5502564311027527] Especially the (only little) lizards.
[0.5466598272323608] Also, look inside pillow cases and pull sheets up quickly and look for anything running.

[0.530422031879425] To sum up, ok accomodation if you only want somewhere reasonably clean to sleep (and the free breakfast is a good cost saver).
[0.5313035249710083] Remember the sypup is quite fattening but look out for the basket which has low fat/sugar syrups.
[0.5313035249710083] We would leave a tip for housekeeping because hey... someone else is cleaning up after my family so for this I am quite grateful!
[0.5316861271858215] Now for the negatives again keeping in mind we were able secure a great price for our stay so negatives are very few in our minds Wi-fi does not go much further than the lobby we already knew this from prior reviews and it really didn't matter.
