[0.5413144826889038] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
[0.5413144826889038] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!
[0.5378588438034058] Of course, when you arrive at the mall, you're in the ladies lingerie dept.

[0.5314888954162598] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!
[0.5314888954162598] Only downside was at 2am someone decided to light a cigarette in a stairwell and set off the smoke alarm causing all of the hotel guests to be evacuated.

[0.5313035249710083] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[0.5313035249710083] Bonus, no need to go out with a coat since the Marriott has indoor access to the Eaton Center...Shoppers Heaven for sure!!!
