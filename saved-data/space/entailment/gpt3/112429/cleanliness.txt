[0.5378588438034058] The room was not clean when the reviewer arrived, and housekeeping did not come by until later in the day.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5454317331314087] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
[0.5426965951919556] I had Sake for $1.
[0.5426965951919556] Monorail super close.
[0.5426965951919556] The bellman made up for it, who gave us the idea of taking Light Rail to the airport, saving us about $35!
[0.5382035374641418] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5313035249710083] It was put away in the glove box and we noticed immediately that it was gone when the Valet brought our car to us.
[0.5314888954162598] I called down to the front desk to find out what time housekeeping would be coming by as I wanted to have a nap before I went to the game.
[0.5341476202011108] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.5353249907493591] It was rush hour, so the concierge had to stand out there quite a while to catch one that was empty.
[0.5378588438034058] Staid here during Sakura-Con with a group of teens.

[0.5378588438034058] Staid here during Sakura-Con with a group of teens.
[0.5378588438034058] My room was warm and I discovered the fan was on, but the A/C was not.
[0.5378588438034058] The thermostat was worn so you could not tell which setting was A/C and which was heat.

[0.534305214881897] I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.
[0.5366135835647583] Pretty basic information for a concierge to screw up on!
