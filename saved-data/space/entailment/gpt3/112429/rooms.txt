[0.55369633436203] The room was on the small side but was stylish, comfortable, and clean.
[0.5413144826889038] Rooms aren't big, just enough room for two people, bathroom had smallish tub but everything was clean and worked.
[0.5413144826889038] The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.
[0.5413144826889038] They did provide us with roll-away beds but then there was no room to move around in the room.
[0.5390766859054565] - Free coffee in the morning and apples in the afternoon - Beds are pretty comfy The cons: - The gym was a joke.
