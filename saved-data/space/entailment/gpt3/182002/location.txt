[0.5461465716362] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.

[0.5378588438034058] The only complaints about the location were about the parking garage, which was difficult to manoevre and had high charges.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5454915761947632] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
[0.5413144826889038] To get to the parking lot from the guest floors you will need to use an access card in the elevators; if you are not quick enough, or your card doesn't work properly, you will find that you are called to another floor.
[0.5413144826889038] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.5413144826889038] After circling the hotel trying to find a parking spot which I eventually did about 1/4 mile from the hotel (on the street), a bum waited in front of my car asking for money.
[0.539843738079071] It is worth noting that the parking garage has very little clearance, and some of the tightest turns I have ever had to negotiate.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5265807509422302] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.5313035249710083] The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot!
[0.5313035249710083] The parking garage was a little tight to drive around in, but other than that, I would definately go back for another weekend with the guys.
[0.5313035249710083] If you have a van or larger vehicle forget parking here.
[0.5314888954162598] It was full when I got there and had to get a "pass" to park in the employees parking lot in the back alley!

[0.537456750869751] There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.

[0.5378588438034058] However, parking can be difficult to find and the hotel charges for parking.

[0.5313035249710083] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[0.5313035249710083] I did not trust the underground parking facilities so made sure to bring all my bags and valuables up to my room.
[0.5313035249710083] The first night there was no parking garage spot available, so we parked were the hotel recommended.
[0.5333937406539917] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.534305214881897] To get to the parking lot from the guest floors you will need to use an access card in the elevators; if you are not quick enough, or your card doesn't work properly, you will find that you are called to another floor.

[0.5314888954162598] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.5378588438034058] It was in a good location on Carlton/College Ave.
[0.5378588438034058] It was only a few blocks east of Yonge St.
[0.5378588438034058] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.5378588438034058] Would stay there again as price was great and location perfect.

[0.5378588438034058] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
