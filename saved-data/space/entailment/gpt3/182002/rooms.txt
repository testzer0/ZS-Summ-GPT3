[0.5378588438034058] There was also some complaints about the lack of amenities at the hotel.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5454317331314087] The hotel however seems to be ageing with the air con unit making a loud grinding noise and shower water sometimes talking hours to drain from the bath tub due to a blockage.
[0.5454317331314087] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.5454317331314087] Nothing in the room felt clean and I agree with one reviewer that the bed "crunched".
[0.5454317331314087] It was gay pride week so very few rooms were available and I had to take a smoking room here at this God-awful place.
[0.5429041385650635] The only thing I did not like about this property is the lack of a indoor swimming pool or even a hot tub.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5293222069740295] My second room also had a window that would not close, there were beer caps scattered throughout the room, there was hair in the tub and on the toilet seat, and the room smelt like an ashtray.
[0.5313035249710083] We specficially asked for a king size bed with no kitchenette.
[0.5313035249710083] It's only a two and a half star hotel so you can't expect all the luxuries of a 4 or 5 star and as a result it was well priced.
[0.5313035249710083] There was brown stuff on the walls of the bathroom, and the room was very shabby.
[0.5313035249710083] the pool area is scarily dirty, full with pigeons, so you might want to skip this offering to stay well.

[0.5378588438034058] They were also able to give us rooms all on the same floor which made things much easier to get ready on the morning of the wedding.
[0.5378588438034058] I was very pleased with the arrangements made, and since we werenâ€™t exactly sure how many rooms we needed, the hotel allowed us to reserve 15 rooms, and provided we told them a few weeks in advance, didnâ€™t charge us for the rooms which we didnâ€™t need.

[0.5378588438034058] I was very pleased with the arrangements made, and since we werenâ€™t exactly sure how many rooms we needed, the hotel allowed us to reserve 15 rooms, and provided we told them a few weeks in advance, didnâ€™t charge us for the rooms which we didnâ€™t need.
[0.5378588438034058] Over all our hotel was clean and we had a newly renovated room.
[0.5378588438034058] We had a good time in the city and would use the Primrose Hotel again.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5378588438034058] The Primrose is a good hotel for people who plan on staying just a few dates in Toronto and plan on only sleeping there.
[0.5378588438034058] The room are clean.
[0.5378588438034058] The bathroom needed a little work but it was good enough for my needs.
[0.5378588438034058] The non-free continental breakfast is a joke.
[0.5378588438034058] I would just find breakfast somewhere else.

[0.5413144826889038] People stay in hotels and expect them to be newly decorated for them rooms have to be used and accommodating.

[0.5313035249710083] The elevators were very scary and one was constantly being repaired.
[0.5313035249710083] The hotel however seems to be ageing with the air con unit making a loud grinding noise and shower water sometimes talking hours to drain from the bath tub due to a blockage.
[0.5313035249710083] it's clearly aging, but on the plus side, this means large rooms that were impeccably clean on check-in and throughout my week-long stay.
[0.5313035249710083] The rooms are in need of a remodel.

[0.5467377305030823] The elevators are a little slow as some other reviews indicated.
[0.5460241436958313] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.5434681177139282] I do not recomemnd taking the elevators in the morning if you are only a few flights from the main floor because people are sardined in the elevator please take the stairs.
[0.5429438352584839] My second room also had a window that would not close, there were beer caps scattered throughout the room, there was hair in the tub and on the toilet seat, and the room smelt like an ashtray.

[0.5300560593605042] The elevators took forever!

[0.5313035249710083] This is especially important now that they are installing kitchenettes in some of the rooms.

[0.5313035249710083] The only issue I did not like was that the fan in the bathroom automatically turns on when you turn on the light, and usually my wife likes to sleep with the bathroom light on, but we didnâ€™t as the fan would be running.
