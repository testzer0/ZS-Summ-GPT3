[0.5378588438034058] I went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and I had what I needed - nice touch.
[0.5378588438034058] The tower elevators, which run on the exterior of the building, were quite cold.
