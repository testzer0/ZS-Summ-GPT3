[0.5378588438034058] I actually miss the beds!

[0.5426965951919556] No frig or microwaves in Doubletree hotels, too many pillows on the bed.
[0.5426965951919556] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.

[0.548638641834259] It's obviously clean, although the further you get into the maze of halls the more the funky smell of "old" permeates the air.
[0.5454317331314087] The rooms are comfortable and the cookies are great but getting smaller.
[0.5429357886314392] The room was quiet, very comfy beds and we enjoyed the view from the 10th floor; the room and hallways could use an update, but are perfectly adequate.
[0.5413144826889038] But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected.
[0.5401560068130493] The hotel interior itself is a bit outdated, but the room we stayed in (in the tower) was very pleasant, relaxing and modern.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5313035249710083] Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.
[0.5313035249710083] The hotel has seen its newer days: the carpets are threadbare in some spots and the cement balconies are noticeably empty of furniture.
[0.5313035249710083] Physically, this is a very tired property.
[0.5313035249710083] While renovations appear to be underway according to signs, the hotel infrastructure shows its age.

[0.5449661612510681] Granted it's a large hotel and I don't like hiking to a room in another zip code.
[0.5422699451446533] Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.
[0.5413144826889038] --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
[0.5401226282119751] This is a very large and confusingly laid out hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5313035249710083] Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room.
[0.5313035249710083] My room was clean and nice but seemed motel like away from the tower.
[0.5313035249710083] Parts of the hotel are laid-out such that it can be difficult to find your room.
[0.5313035249710083] The rooms in the wings are larger than those in the tower and if you get wings 2 or 3 closer than walking to the tower wing plus no elevator hassle.
[0.5313035249710083] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
