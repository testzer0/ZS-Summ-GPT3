[0.539843738079071] The building is nicely decorated, but the rooms are old and in need of renovation.

[0.541980504989624] Bad Points * half renovated the common areas are nice, the bathrooms have no bath tubs but new bathrooms.
[0.539843738079071] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.5378588438034058] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
[0.5378588438034058] Nothing a little renovation couldn't quickly take care of.
[0.5378588438034058] We went to the Pacific Culinary Institute and that was amazing!

----- Weakening -----

[0.5314888954162598] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[0.5378588438034058] While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
[0.5378588438034058] He was very impressed and requested a tour of the brewery, which the brew-master provided for him.
[0.5378588438034058] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[0.5378588438034058] It was a fun, informative, and flexible way to view the entire city.

[0.5378588438034058] The staff is friendly, but the elevator is scary and the pay-per-view movie didn't work.

[0.5378588438034058] I'd have given it 5 stars if only the desk chair hadn't had arms and been a royal pain to move around.
[0.5378588438034058] The hotel's lobby was undergoing renovations at the time but it never created any issues with our stay.

[0.5314888954162598] The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.
