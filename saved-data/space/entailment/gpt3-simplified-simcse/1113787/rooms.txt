[0.5910279750823975] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[0.5759522914886475] Didn't really bother us because it was laid out well but if we had been there a number of days and spent them in the room, it would have gotten cramped.
