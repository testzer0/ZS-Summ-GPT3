[0.4929245412349701] The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.
[0.3708823323249817] Bad Points * half renovated the common areas are nice, the bathrooms have no bath tubs but new bathrooms.
[0.35730013251304626] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.31023603677749634] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[0.30036914348602295] You do have a art institute across the road.

[-0.03847609460353851] We arrived a little late on Xmas day after a troublesome time with the car rental company (Budget did not have a car for me despite having a valid reservation).
[0.030029576271772385] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
[0.035039473325014114] granville island is a community in itself.
[0.07623304426670074] I'd have given it 5 stars if only the desk chair hadn't had arms and been a royal pain to move around.
