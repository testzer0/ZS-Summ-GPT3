[0.016513561829924583] One of the drawbacks of staying on Granville Island is the parking - almost impossible at the weekend, even after paying the hotel $7 for a pass that allows you to park beyond the normal 3 hour limit.

[-0.09605303406715393] One of the drawbacks of staying on Granville Island is the parking - almost impossible at the weekend, even after paying the hotel $7 for a pass that allows you to park beyond the normal 3 hour limit.
