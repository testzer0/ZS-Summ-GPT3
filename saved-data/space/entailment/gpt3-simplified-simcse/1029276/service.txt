[0.6580286026000977] The OMNI trainstation was only a block away.
[0.3719453811645508] For example, I was told by the front desk that I needed to go down to the transportation office in order to book the shuttle to the cruise terminal.
[0.3157562017440796] All you need to do is hop on the bus or metromover which is almost outside the door!
[0.3055034875869751] We arrived there after a very long flight from Ireland and we were delighted to have such a fast check in and such friendly service.
[0.29808250069618225] If you're visiting the med school, it's supposedly only 2.5 miles away - but it took me nearly half an hour to deal with the miami traffic - so either familiarize yourself the night before OR leave early enough to address the bumper to bumper traffic.

[-0.12039341032505035] Loved Angelina who served us every night in the lounge bar!
[-0.07243753969669342] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.
[-0.05859518423676491] Would honestly give 3.5 but 3 is a bit low.
[-0.044095784425735474] I even asked a random employee about towels poolside & he was more than happy to help even though it's not technically his job.
[-0.04105045273900032] There was a male bartender that in my opinion was very rude, unprofessional and obviously doesnâ€™t like his job, but that was my only negative encounter.
