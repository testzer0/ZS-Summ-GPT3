[0.6713180541992188] There is not much to do nearby .

----- Supporting -----

[0.6713180541992188] Unless you have a rental car, you're at the mercy of taxis to find an interesting neighborhood since this one is so bland.
[0.6005258560180664] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.5768635869026184] The location is not that good for the regular tourist with no car but a Metromover station is nearby.
[0.5492395162582397] But not much in walking range.
[0.5422909259796143] Being downtown the hotel is a bit lacking in local amenities.

[-0.19871649146080017] I also told the front desk manager Christopher that it was a special trip as both my daughters had birthdays.
[-0.10096556693315506] Even though we booked on a discount site, we felt like important guests.
[-0.09951350092887878] We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton.
[-0.09538190066814423] Hotel was ideally located for the purpose of my business trip.
[-0.07169260084629059] So even though there was a mix up with my bag which caused me some frustration and sleeplessness, the Hilton more than made up for it.

[0.7234048843383789] Parking is super expensive, but that's Miami for you, at $28 per day.
[0.6993228197097778] Parking is absurd.
[0.6952328681945801] Valet parking was over $25.

----- Supporting -----

[0.716076672077179] The Hotel is good - the location is not.
[0.6925256848335266] The only downfall is that the hotel could have been in a better area.
[0.5519872307777405] The hotel restaurant was adequate; however, the staff here also strived to please.
[0.5442768931388855] Being downtown the hotel is a bit lacking in local amenities.
[0.534105658531189] I did not like the area the hotel was in i would of prefered south beach area.

[-0.044878702610731125] Indoor Park a block and a half away just off 2nd Ave and 14th St. on your left.
[-0.044685062021017075] And yes, we were now near an ice machine.
[-0.004938479512929916] Aside from the convenient location to the MetroMover, which was all we needed to get to the bayside station.
[0.018387462943792343] Bayside Plaza is a short taxi ride away which is a lot of fun especially on Super Bowl week end and the Metromover is just a block away which gives access to Metrorail.
[0.033670857548713684] Close to all - short taxi ride away.

[0.4657340347766876] The only downside is that it is a bit of a hassle to get to the beach compared to staying in South Beach, but I already knew that going into the stay.
[0.44907546043395996] nearby the Bayside arena and a short drive to Miami Beach (art Deco).

[-0.04482021927833557] Would never stay here again and maybe not at another Hilton either.

[0.8030784726142883] It might not be suitable for families due to the drive inn restaurant across the street .

----- Supporting -----

[0.8030784726142883] Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.
