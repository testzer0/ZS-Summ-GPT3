[0.3960935175418854] Be warned, I needed the internet for my school work, you must go to the lobby it is not available in the rooms.

[0.7519792318344116] The shuttle bus to the theme parks was not always on time , and that it could be difficult to get a seat on the bus .

----- Supporting -----

[0.7519792318344116] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
[0.6882387399673462] There is also free shuttle buses to the parks but can get full as they pick up from several places.
[0.6494393348693848] We didn't have a car so it worked with the shuttle to the parks (although it took a really long time!)
[0.6478143930435181] Close to parks...free shuttle to attractions but buses get full fast, they pick up at other hotels along the way.
