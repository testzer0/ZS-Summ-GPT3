[-0.0749606192111969] We booked through First Choice and they really should not be selling this place to customers.
[-0.06123454496264458] P.s sanford airport hasnt got scales to weigh cases before you check in!!
[-0.03148806840181351] Please note, although I booked online directly through the company’s website, I have been informed that it was a third party transaction and they WILL NOT cancel my reservation without the confirmation number which i do not have, yet they can see my reservation in front of them.
[-0.006853451021015644] Firstly, reception won't really care as we found them quite surely and unhelpful, and secondly the rooms are not gleaming and smelling of rose petals!
