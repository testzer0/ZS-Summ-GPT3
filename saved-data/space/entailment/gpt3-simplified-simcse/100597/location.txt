[0.5928016901016235] The only drawback was that the restaurant was a little on the pricey side for breakfast, but there are many places nearby to eat.
[0.5767568945884705] The restaurant was quite good considering it's not "downtown".
[0.5449994802474976] The restaurant and bar restaurant are better than average and again great staff.

[0.5522632002830505] I can see paying parking for a downtown hotel - but for a hotel at Sea-Tac it seemed absurd to have to pay parking.
[0.5379770994186401] At my prompting he suggested the self-park behind the hotel but it was almost as expensive as the valet!
[0.5276743173599243] I understand charging when leaving the car consecutive days when not using the hotel, but there shouldn't be a charge at a suburban hotel for guests for one night.
