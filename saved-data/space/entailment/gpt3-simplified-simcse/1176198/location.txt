[0.7293791770935059] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.
[0.7208964824676514] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.6520189046859741] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.651416540145874] With regards to the nightclub next door.

[0.7193780541419983] Some reviewers found the location noisy due to the proximity to the entertainment district .

----- Supporting -----

[0.7193780541419983] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.683853268623352] as most reviewers said, the nightclub is loud.
[0.5894010066986084] Other Comments: the location is not too far from some great downtown clubs.
[0.5819560289382935] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.
[0.5664212703704834] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).

[0.7283868193626404] Parking was noted as being convenient , although valet-only .

----- Supporting -----

[0.7283868193626404] Parking is valet only (would prefer the option to self park).
[0.6436870098114014] I think the valet parking at the hotel is around the same amount and you can take your car in and out as needed.
[0.6240148544311523] There are lots of parking lots near by that look cheaper than the hotel valet system (one right across the road).
[0.6086182594299316] The hotel has Valet parking only which is fine since you can walk to everything.
[0.5978381037712097] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.
