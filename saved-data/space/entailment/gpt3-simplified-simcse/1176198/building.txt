[0.5248441696166992] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[0.4765400290489197] The lobby has delicious cookies every afternoon.
