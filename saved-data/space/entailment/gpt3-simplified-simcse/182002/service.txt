----- Supporting -----

[0.5526556968688965] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.
[0.4123537540435791] It was built using cheap consumer-grade access points instead of business grade ones that are more reliable and can be centrally managed.
[0.3758476674556732] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.3485463261604309] It is obvious that Customer Service is not a priority for this hotel.
