[-0.033750198781490326] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[-0.025052983313798904] You might also get stuck in the elevator, though the manager said that it happens all the time.
[-0.023889299482107162] You have to drive very slow and carefully to make sure you don't damage your car.

[0.347027450799942] We had many people coming for this conference that had scratched their cars or some that cracked their exhaust pipe.
[0.3296019434928894] We were beside the elevator and at one point someone in the elevator kept hitting the alarm button and we could hear it.
[0.304322749376297] It appears this hotel also serves as a university residence, but there was no noise issue with that.
[0.2649589776992798] Be prepared to wait at least five minutes, and the doors sensors do not work, which was very annoying.
[0.21106886863708496] We waited 25 minutes for a car to move and had to find management to clear it so we could proceed!
