[0.6870404481887817] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).
[0.5713680982589722] The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out.
[0.5130919814109802] I was surprised to find that the area itself was a bit seedy.
[0.507901668548584] The only gripe I had really, was that the bar shut very early & we couldn`t get a beer when we returned after our night on the town.

[0.537462592124939] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.

[-0.07598462700843811] Didn't try the restaurant....got there late!
[-0.07189662009477615] Shame they couldn't have arranged the weather!!
[-0.06529031693935394] I didn't eat at the restaurant, so can't comment on that.
[-0.037290990352630615] When at the restaurant, they gave me catchup that was so rancid it bubbled.
[-0.03522643819451332] There was a restraunt in the hotel but we never eat there.

[0.6398534774780273] It is also close to Massey Hall for concert-goers .

[0.6398534774780273] Great location, close to CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Yonge Street, Hockey Hall of Fame.
[0.5680495500564575] We were there for a Chicago concert at Massey Hall and it was about a ten minute walk.
[0.5145678520202637] There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.
[0.5056033730506897] The hotel is in a great location and we were close to the CN Tower, the museum and the Hockey Hall of Fame.

[0.6393191814422607] The only downside is the cost of parking .

----- Supporting -----

[0.6393191814422607] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.6342153549194336] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.616624116897583] If you are staying here be warned about the parking though.
[0.5815169811248779] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.5356040596961975] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.

[-0.06871920824050903] The restaurant buffet for breakfast was good, the wait staff was very pleasant.
[-0.055948443710803986] THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.
[-0.009009496308863163] We did not have a room reserved and were happy they were able to take us without a reservation.
[-0.006704618688672781] I did have breakfast in the morning in the restaurant beside the lobby area and was pleased with the level of service from the waiter and while he did make a small mistake on my order (he gave me potatoes when I asked for no potatoes), it was quickly rectified, and he continued to provide attentive service.
[-0.0051810164004564285] The best thing about the room was its view.

[0.643080472946167] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
[0.6321707367897034] The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot!
