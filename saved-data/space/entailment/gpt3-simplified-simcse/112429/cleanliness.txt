[0.4443015456199646] My room was warm and I discovered the fan was on, but the A/C was not.
[0.4411725103855133] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
[0.4049144685268402] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.

[0.33728617429733276] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).

[0.4461096525192261] I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.
[0.3747067451477051] Never ever seen this in any hotel I have ever stayed at.
[0.3544864058494568] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
