[0.04587397351861] You donâ€™t walk in to a fancy lobby, but you also donâ€™t have to pay for it.
[0.0571264922618866] I talked to the front desk and they painlessly arranged for a hotel town car to take me in so I could make my flight on time.
[0.07349356263875961] Portland is a great city to visit, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

[0.6058298349380493] The man who was working at the front desk looked very gruff and mean, when I would ask something he made me feel like I was putting him out.
[0.4150364398956299] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
