[-0.8609046936035156] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.

[-0.9192352294921875] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
