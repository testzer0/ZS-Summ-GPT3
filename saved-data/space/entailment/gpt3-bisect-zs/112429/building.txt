[0.9900379180908203] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.

[0.0087890625] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.

[-0.004700183868408203] The hotel was under exterior renovations, but that worked out for me as I was out of my room for most of the day.
[-0.0052547454833984375] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.
[-0.006037235260009766] Small lobby very intimate but best of all was location.

[-0.11233139038085938] The elevator was marked and scuffed.
[-0.11504364013671875] They could not find our car for about an hour!
