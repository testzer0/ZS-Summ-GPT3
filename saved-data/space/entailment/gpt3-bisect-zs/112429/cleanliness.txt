[0.000453948974609375] Getting my car from the valet took less than three minutes... My stay at the Paramount was a very pleasant and positive experience.

[-0.9283733367919922] They just seem unsanitary to me.
[-0.8774852752685547] The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.
[-0.838536262512207] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.
[-0.8039054870605469] I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.
[-0.5149612426757812] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.

[-0.005961418151855469] The Dragonfish Sushi is right in the hotel downstairs.
[-0.00638580322265625] Lolita was great as well.
[-0.010710716247558594] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
