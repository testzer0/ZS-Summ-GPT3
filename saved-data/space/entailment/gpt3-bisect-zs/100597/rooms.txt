----- Supporting -----

[0.6555099487304688] We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied.
[0.4525604248046875] We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased.
[0.4482421875] Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport.
[0.4462127685546875] We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9648170471191406] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.9611892700195312] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[-0.9320869445800781] To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.
[-0.9171905517578125] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).
[-0.8970203399658203] This hotel disappointed.

[0.6873397827148438] Love that the hotel provided a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, every 15-20mins.
[0.423004150390625] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.

[-0.7035980224609375] The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare.
[-0.5576057434082031] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[-0.5543289184570312] Room was highly run down.
[-0.542724609375] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9742527008056641] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.33864593505859375] This hotel is by a small lake and at dusk there are misquitos and misc.
[0.065399169921875] The hotel is big and busy, so it always feels like there is some commotion going on in the common areas.
[0.013946533203125] --The doors to the rooms have a huge gap at the bottom - allows a lot of light and sound in from the hallway.

[-0.07978439331054688] The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers).
[-0.034015655517578125] Would avoid this hotel in the future.
[-0.015588760375976562] This is a pretty rundown hotel.

[0.8915309906005859] My room was very easy to find, but I know others had some difficulties finding their rooms.
[0.38153076171875] This is a very large and confusingly laid out hotel.
[0.3159942626953125] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[0.25555419921875] Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.
[0.15155029296875] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.

[0.880889892578125] Some of them indicated that they were comfortable with the beds .

----- Supporting -----

[0.880889892578125] Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.
[0.6277923583984375] My wife really liked the Crabtree & Evelyn "Citron" toiletries; I liked the very comfortable bed and blackout curtains.
[0.5980644226074219] Clean rooms, comfortable bed.
[0.4993171691894531] The hotel was clean, beds were fine, hotel is located across the street from the air port, was within walking distance to a Denny's, Jack in the Box, and a steak place.
[0.464935302734375] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.

[0.9882068634033203] Breakfast is good .

----- Supporting -----

[0.9882068634033203] Breakfast was good and the staff were very helpful.
[0.9734077453613281] Excellent morning breakfasts and the airport shuttle runs every 15 minutes but we have made the 10 minute walk numerous times to the airport terminal.
[0.9487457275390625] Breakfast was delicious in the coffee shop, hot scones with jam and coffee.

[0.856048583984375] The rooms are relatively spacious, our kids love the pool, and the breakfast buffet isn't a bad deal for what you get.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.73431396484375] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
