[0.7925987243652344] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
[0.1826934814453125] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
[0.02496337890625] They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin.
[0.004154205322265625] It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.
