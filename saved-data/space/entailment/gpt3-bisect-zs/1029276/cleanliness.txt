[0.1107177734375] One or two issues during our stay included :- Housekeeping - at least 2 days out of the 5 our room was not made up and we had to chase housekeeping.
[0.089263916015625] The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
[0.0070953369140625] Some fun decor and some oldish.
[0.00067138671875] HOUSEKEEPING: Never understood that there were 4 people in the room (room can hold 5) and choose to only put towels for 3 each day we were day (4 days) despite many calls to the front desk.
