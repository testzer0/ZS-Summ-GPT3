[0.55828857421875] so I would like to say thx to all staff and especiall to fernando for this great service, that's one of the reason why we will come again soon... it was the first and definitely not the last time.
[0.5328102111816406] The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet!
[0.33197784423828125] Wish to point out the excellent service I and my guests have enjoyed in the dining room from the manager in charge Mr Avi Zarchi and his team.
[0.269195556640625] On the upside the manager bought us dinner and drinks at the restaurant for our inconvenience at check-in and he was very apologetic and nice.

[-0.7451648712158203] I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami.
[-0.54412841796875] When I got downstairs to the motor lobby there was no one at the transportation office.
[-0.5263957977294922] There was a male bartender that in my opinion was very rude, unprofessional and obviously doesnâ€™t like his job, but that was my only negative encounter.

[0.08624267578125] However, some guests felt that the staff lied about the Miami bus system .

----- Supporting -----

[0.08624267578125] Staff lied that the bus system of Miami was very difficult to use when in fact it was more inexpensive and a lot easier than getting around w/ a taxi.
[0.055328369140625] I complained to the "manager" and she told me that it was "their culture".
[0.047271728515625] He told me that no one was at the transportation office but he took my room number and told me he would have a shuttle for me at the time requested.
[0.0406341552734375] When we tried to get answers, he waved his hands in our face and dismissed us and told us to talk to someone else in the morning.
[0.00262451171875] For example, I was told by the front desk that I needed to go down to the transportation office in order to book the shuttle to the cruise terminal.

[-0.04360198974609375] Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls.
