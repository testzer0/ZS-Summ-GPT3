[0.8560028076171875] And there is not much to do nearby .

----- Supporting -----

[0.8560028076171875] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.79656982421875] There are hardly any shops nearby except for a fast-food outlet opposite the hotel.
[0.78643798828125] The only drawback is that near by the hotel you do not have any life, and the park option is expensive 28 usd.
[0.7668228149414062] But not much in walking range.
[0.51904296875] On-site restaurant was simply okay, surrounding neighborhood was very blah, and the staff was ambivalent.

[0.8440055847167969] Parking is super expensive, but that's Miami for you, at $28 per day.
[0.7263336181640625] Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs.
[0.6104888916015625] Valet parking was very pricy ($ 28) but very efficient.
[0.5598640441894531] I also did not care for the $28/ day parking fee.

[0.5102462768554688] We booked via web and got a fair price last fall.
[0.30975341796875] Valet parking was very pricy ($ 28) but very efficient.

[-0.1370849609375] When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore.
[-0.1363677978515625] The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace.

[0.115478515625] One other note..the restaurant in the hotel is nice but the waiters are drenched in cologne so that is all you smell and taste.
[0.0997161865234375] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
