[-0.16942596435546875] Also a lot of the rooms face an office building, so theres not much privacy, because the curtains are very easily seen through, but overall if your willing to pay over 250 a night, your really only paying for the location and the walkway to the mall.
[-0.13019561767578125] Itâ€™s probably a 20-minute walk (rough guess and depends how fast you walk) to the Harbour Front with loads of restaurants (I ate at the Watermark Irish Pub).
