[-0.2645263671875] I was there the morning of the false fire alarm and although it was annoying I would rather it be false than for real!
[-0.14599609375] How easy could it have been for someone else to leave with our truck if they could bring us the wrong car?
[-0.0972442626953125] We had to rent a car and travel back to US to have key made.
[-0.0449066162109375] The descriptions of the neighborhood other reviewers made in the past are correct: there are some questionable-looking people, but that is just one of the elements of any big city.
[-0.01673126220703125] My husband had to drive back following week to Toronto from US after having been on the road for work for four days, to get our car back, that had been sitting underground under the hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.6732177734375] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[-0.3229713439941406] There were weird grease marks on the wall as well.
