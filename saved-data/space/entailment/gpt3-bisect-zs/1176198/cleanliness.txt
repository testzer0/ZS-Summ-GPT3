[0.705352783203125] My only complaint about the room was the Wi-Fi...terrible signal from it and half the time (at least) I couldn't even get on the internet.
[0.657440185546875] The rooms are equal to anything Hilton offers, the fitness facility is first rate and the restaurant staff are friendly and attentive - to the right degree.
[0.388336181640625] Super clean..i mean there wasn't any dust...dirt, smudges...The (glass or plexiglass) partition for whirpool was so clean that it positively sparkled.

[-0.2288818359375] the Pool, while not large, was comfortable and clean, and the workout facilities were excellent.
[-0.22491455078125] Incidentally, the valet brought up the wrong car, notwithstanding that there were probably few cars with Virginia license plates in the garage.

[0.0235748291015625] Arrived early 10.15 and asked if I could leave my bags and check in later, the girl on the desk let me check in straight away, a real bonus when sometimes they make you wait until 3pm.
