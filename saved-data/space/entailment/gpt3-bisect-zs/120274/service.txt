----- Supporting -----

[0.394683837890625] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
[0.051055908203125] We didn't want to drive so we relied on these and they took ages and were in a very bed condition.
[0.046905517578125] If your phone charger does not work (like mine) go to the reception and say that you left your charger the last time you stayed any they will be more than happy to take you to a room full to the roof of 2 pin phone chargers, it may take you hrs.

[0.8191986083984375] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
[0.819000244140625] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
[0.8104171752929688] Everyone at the hotel was pleasant and helpful.
[0.76080322265625] Hotel does supply free shuttle buses to all theme parks which go every day and you don't have to bye your tickets from the guest services at the front of the hotel happy holidays.

[-0.80047607421875] One day, the bus was so overcrowded that i would say it was very dangerous (approx 40 people standing in the centre isle).
[-0.7881317138671875] We wanted to go to International drive to see all the shops but we ended up after taking four buses at a mall still it was a sight.
