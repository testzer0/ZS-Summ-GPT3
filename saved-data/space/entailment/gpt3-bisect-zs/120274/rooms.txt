[0.9535789489746094] Complimentary breakfast was mediocre, I'd rather go to some nearby restaurant's breakfast buffets for $4++/person.
[0.9463348388671875] 3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .
[0.8797073364257812] There is a light breakfast served every morning - cornflakes, toast and coffee - which is again ok but nothing special.
[0.8723621368408203] I would not recommend this hotel really - it is very basic, so is the breakfast

----- Supporting -----

[0.9851036071777344] Our only negatives points were the breakfast was very poor.
[0.9832363128662109] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[0.9781837463378906] Breakfast was terrible, cleaning was very average.
[0.9475364685058594] Worst "free" breakfast I have ever had.

[0.9500484466552734] Cons: - Breakfast was very basic and sometimes it was hard to get a seat.
[0.920318603515625] you do get a free breakfast every morning but get there early if you want a seat as space is limited , the hotel has got a free shuttle to parks , but we had a car as this is much easier in florida .
[0.8945159912109375] Breakfast is a free for all,only one toaster for all the guests, we had to take ours back to our room as never any where to sit.
[0.8381500244140625] The breakfast is served in the lobby area and there are limited tables but you could always eat it in your room or if you don't like what's on offer there are numerous buffet restaurants nearby serving food at prices to suit all pockets.

[-0.5655517578125] THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.

[-0.4583320617675781] It was just kind of old/dated & grimy!

[0.8939208984375] The pool is not clean .

----- Supporting -----

[0.8939208984375] The pool was not user friendly... the bugs carried you away.
[0.719512939453125] The hotel staff then decided to paint the pool surround area resulting in one side or another of the pool being closed on four different days while the paint dried.
[0.6481781005859375] We never used the pool as there were only a few sun parasols and it was just too hot to be in the full sun.
[0.5795364379882812] We had a ground floor room on the opposite side from the pool, it smelled of damp and there was mold on the toilet wall.
[0.5528182983398438] It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!
