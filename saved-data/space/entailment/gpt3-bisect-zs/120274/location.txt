[0.8350830078125] BUT personally i always stay clear of international drive as i find it quite run down and too busy............if you enjoy the 192 area of kissimee then this hotel is fine!
[0.762847900390625] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.758880615234375] The location is excellent - this end of the 192 is like a miniature (but busier) version of International Drive!!
[0.318389892578125] It is located on 192 which is close to everything which is nice but I would say to stay somewhere else, somewhere with basic amenities for the same budget price.
