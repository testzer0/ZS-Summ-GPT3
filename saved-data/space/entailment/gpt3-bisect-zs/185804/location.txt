[0.7739467620849609] Being a only a few minutes walk to Granville Island Market and a variety of nice, small shops was a bonus.
[0.1649169921875] This hotel is located close enough to downtown to walk to in 1/2 hour( using the aquabus to cross the channel) but also very close to local interesting sites on granville island and is a 15 min walk to Broadway St and 4th Ave where there are numerous placed to eat.
[0.122528076171875] Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market.
[0.021341323852539062] The location of the hotel also makes it easy to have a stroll around Granville Island, but you'll need a taxi to get to the clubs and shopping in the city proper.
[0.017778396606445312] Within a 2 minute walk there are fantastic spots for breakfast, lunch and dinner and fun shopping and access to the sea wall.

[-0.9069480895996094] We held our wedding reception at the Hotel's lounge and found that we were overall very disappointed.
[-0.8649463653564453] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[-0.7195863723754883] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.4975776672363281] There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.
[-0.46675872802734375] The only reason I did not give it 5 out of 5 stars is because of its location.

[0.059051513671875] Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes.
[0.032894134521484375] Location wise hard to beat, just a short ferry ride from town and an easy walk over bridge.
[0.009164810180664062] Hop on a nearby ferry to explore downtown, the West End, Yaletown or Chinatown.
[0.00801849365234375] The wonderful public market and numerous restaurants and shops are just a quick walk away, as are the ferries that take you to other parts of Vancouver.
