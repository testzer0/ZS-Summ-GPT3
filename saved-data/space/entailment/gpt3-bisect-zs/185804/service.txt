[0.31511688232421875] First, wonderful staff who were so attentive to my needs, treating and speaking with me with respect that is often hard to find in modern hotels.
[0.14698028564453125] We find the hotel rooms well appointed and comfortable; the staff friendly and accomodating.
[0.13729095458984375] The staff welcomed us with great warmth and throughout our stay were genuinely pleased to offer help and advice on topics such as buses (including whether it was better to walk or take the ferry).
[0.08409500122070312] Nothing was too much trouble for them.
[0.08174514770507812] But the main high-light for us, as we are sick of being in our cars in Los Angeles, was the public transportation.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.1457500457763672] Unfortunately they just don't have the level of service that would make them a great hotel.
[-0.019927978515625] The desk staff would not look up on Hotels.ca the discrepancies we sited when checking out but they were very cheery and smiling the whole time while denying our information which was infuriating!
[-0.013673782348632812] The staff just seemed disinterested, especially at the bar and the front desk.

[-0.010440826416015625] I didn't spend much time actually at the hotel so my interaction with staff was limited as well.
