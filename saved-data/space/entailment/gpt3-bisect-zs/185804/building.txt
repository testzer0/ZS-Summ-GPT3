----- Supporting -----

[0.890167236328125] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.07672119140625] *The art in the rooms are old and are of Delta, why not GI?
[0.00862884521484375] Nothing a little renovation couldn't quickly take care of.
[0.006470680236816406] We went to the Pacific Culinary Institute and that was amazing!
[0.0051116943359375] The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.

[-0.146728515625] It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
[-0.14323043823242188] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.09015655517578125] There is no easy chair.
[-0.07433319091796875] There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
