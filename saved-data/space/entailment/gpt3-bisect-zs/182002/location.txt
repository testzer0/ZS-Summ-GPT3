----- Supporting -----

[0.622467041015625] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.08471488952636719] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9822158813476562] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.968109130859375] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.9022216796875] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
[0.8035888671875] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.711395263671875] I couldn't believe they were trying to stick me for a charge when I hadn't been able to park in the garage, the spot was supposed to be free, the spot was recommended by the hotel staff, AND my car was broken into while parked there.

[-0.27587890625] Heed this warning stay away from this crappy place, you'll be glad you did.
[-0.08324432373046875] I would not reccomend this place to even my worst ennemies.
[-0.0634765625] THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.
[-0.05937957763671875] Shame they couldn't have arranged the weather!!
[-0.028076171875] I did ask if I just could use maybe a land line but no luck.

[0.4521942138671875] It is located near the Massey Hall for concert-goers .

----- Supporting -----

[0.4521942138671875] We were there for a Chicago concert at Massey Hall and it was about a ten minute walk.
[0.0017137527465820312] The location is great.
[0.0012722015380859375] Would stay there again as price was great and location perfect.

[-0.5595893859863281] the one across the street from the "Made in China" chinese restaurant, which was decent cheap eats on it's own!
[-0.44745635986328125] Only good thing was that it was a few blocks from the subway.
[-0.3664512634277344] The location was perfect as I walked to the Eaton Centre which was about 10 minutes away, and then the cab ride back only cost $8 including a tip.
[-0.30741405487060547] Close enough to walk to the Eaton Centre.
[-0.2881011962890625] A Cora's breakfast and Starbucks was two blocks away.

[0.9794273376464844] The only downside is the cost of parking .

----- Supporting -----

[0.9794273376464844] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.9494857788085938] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[0.842071533203125] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.724639892578125] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
[0.6782989501953125] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.6756963729858398] The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out.
[-0.667022705078125] The only gripe I had really, was that the bar shut very early & we couldn`t get a beer when we returned after our night on the town.
[-0.4066429138183594] Heed this warning stay away from this crappy place, you'll be glad you did.
[-0.34297943115234375] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).
[-0.33934783935546875] THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.

[0.6297607421875] It costs $23 a day, is expensive compared to other cities .

[0.02165985107421875] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[-0.0002689361572265625] They were also kind enough to recommend and make reservations at a lovely restaurant called Ruth Chris (pricey but well worth it if you are a steak lover).
[-0.0007848739624023438] This restaurant has a loyal group of customers.
[-0.0008745193481445312] The hotel itself is in a good location.

[-0.7803001403808594] From the map it looked like it was pretty much in the middle of the downtown area and the rate was cheaper than some of the other hotels.
[-0.7120513916015625] The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.

[-0.36267852783203125] Went on Bestwestern.com and booked the room online for $89.00 a night.
[-0.36035633087158203] It was close to the theatre we were going to and the price was affordable.
