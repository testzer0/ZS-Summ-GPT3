[0.6444006562232971] The building has unique architecture .

----- Supporting -----

[0.7153364419937134] They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin.
[0.7037752270698547] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
[0.7028297781944275] The exterior of the buildings in these wings looks like some outdated Polynesian tiki architecture.
[0.6958491802215576] It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings.
[0.6745994687080383] There is an abundance of gardens in between the different buildings and all were very well maintained and tended.

----- Weakening -----

[0.6014204025268555] The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport.
[0.6193592548370361] Stayed in the high-rise portion.
[0.6224998235702515] Access to the tower is by external glass elevators.
[0.6382110118865967] One wing building was closed for renovation.
[0.6382110118865967] I went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and I had what I needed - nice touch.
