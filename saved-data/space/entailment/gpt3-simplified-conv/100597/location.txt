[0.6827011108398438] They do have an airport shuttle.
[0.6780912280082703] This was right by the SeaTac Airport, whereby they had a shuttle that would come every 20 mins, and the valet would park the vehicle while we off traveling.
[0.6764351725578308] Free shuttle to the airport got us to the terminal in about 3 minutes!
[0.6737186312675476] When you need a hotel near the Sea Tac Airport, stay at the Doubletree and ride their shuttle.

[0.6351245641708374] The restaurant is expensive .

----- Supporting -----

[0.7207509279251099] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.
[0.7207509279251099] We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee.
[0.7194753885269165] I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car.
[0.717418909072876] Unfortunately there was no wifi and the parking was $16 per night - expensive for the area.
[0.7122413516044617] This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking.

----- Weakening -----

[0.6066044569015503] I reserved off Priceline and got a great rate.
[0.6289046406745911] We did book directly on the Hilton chain website and got a rate of about $89.
[0.6351245641708374] It had easy access to the light rail located at the airport (we took the DT shuttle over), and was next to an Enterprise car rental.
[0.6351245641708374] Valet parking was very quick and hassle free.

[0.6870306134223938] Initially, I had a view of the airport.

[0.6066044569015503] There were elevators, gift shop, restaurant and lots of other dining choices just across the street.
[0.6066044569015503] I didn't have a car so Airport, Light Rail and many restaurants are in walking distance.
[0.6066044569015503] Strange for such a large hotel not to have a restaurant or two.
[0.6066044569015503] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[0.6066044569015503] If you are coming late and/or leaving early at Sea-Tac, this is not a bad choice.

[0.7167860865592957] This hotel was within a stone's throw of Sea-Tac airport and right next to the off-site Thrifty car rental lot, so for location, it was great.
[0.6994709372520447] The parking situation was a bit weird - we had a rental we needed to return and we were given 20 free minutes to unload and get the car out, but the rental return was next door, whcih was nice.
[0.6889059543609619] Very conveinient for early morning flights.
[0.6871297955513] The restaurant and bar restaurant are better than average and again great staff.
[0.6871297955513] On the downside, I just recently tried to make a reservation for another night with my husband, and they want to charge $10 for the second person.

----- Weakening -----

[0.6066044569015503] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[0.6066044569015503] This place had a gigantic parking lot.

[0.6907438039779663] I understand charging when leaving the car consecutive days when not using the hotel, but there shouldn't be a charge at a suburban hotel for guests for one night.
[0.6871297955513] Strange for such a large hotel not to have a restaurant or two.
[0.6871297955513] At 1am the lobby bar was still very active with a jovial but well-behaved crowd, although the bartenders were understandably ready to head home to their families.

----- Weakening -----

[0.5917698740959167] Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax.
[0.5984439849853516] At my prompting he suggested the self-park behind the hotel but it was almost as expensive as the valet!
[0.6066044569015503] When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that.

[0.7045968770980835] But it is fine for what it is- a quick, convenient, comfortable stay by the airport.
[0.6930112242698669] Just too too big for a one night stay, but a lovely hotel after all.

[0.7250337600708008] We purchased the Park and Fly Package and were very happy to discover that this package included valet parking for our car directly out front of the hotel, not off in a back parking lot or at an off site location like many other hotels.
[0.7144802212715149] My only complaint about this hotel was the charge for parking.
[0.7121514081954956] Only one hiccup when we were collecting our car through their valet ,the valet asked pretty abruptly as we $5 tipped him if we had settled our parking fee.
