[0.6034159064292908] The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare.

[0.7272731065750122] But although the room was huge and lavish with two large queens, it was not a place I enjoyed.
[0.7259640693664551] Priceline should be ASHAMED of rating it up with the Hilton SEATAC, where I was placed on the first night.
[0.7067290544509888] This Doubletree is very tired, and more like a 2 star property than a 3 star.

[0.6034159064292908] Room was an "upgrade" but so far from the elevator.
[0.6034159064292908] Parts of the hotel are laid-out such that it can be difficult to find your room.
[0.6034159064292908] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.

[0.6289046406745911] The hotel is big and busy, so it always feels like there is some commotion going on in the common areas.

[0.7206580638885498] Bathroom floors seems dirty and needed to be regrouted.

----- Weakening -----

[0.6034159064292908] I asked for a different room and was given a much better view on the other side of the main section of the hotel.
[0.6066044569015503] My co-workers with wing rooms said they were 'okay' and they heard some noise from neighboring rooms.
[0.6066044569015503] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[0.6066044569015503] Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room.
[0.6066044569015503] Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor.

[0.6894992589950562] Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.

----- Weakening -----

[0.6024806499481201] Carpet was old as were the other furnishings.
[0.6034159064292908] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.6034159064292908] --Restaurant staff seemed to be overwhelmed during breakfast, so they fell behind a bit.
[0.6034159064292908] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[0.6042357683181763] The hotel has seen its newer days: the carpets are threadbare in some spots and the cement balconies are noticeably empty of furniture.

[0.6066044569015503] The bathroom was dirty and stained.
[0.6066044569015503] This Doubletree is very tired, and more like a 2 star property than a 3 star.
[0.6066044569015503] With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room.
