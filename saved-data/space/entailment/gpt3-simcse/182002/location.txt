[-0.14818231761455536] Shame they couldn't have arranged the weather!!
[-0.11339782178401947] I would not reccomend this place to even my worst ennemies.
[-0.10172775387763977] I didn't eat at the restaurant, so can't comment on that.
[-0.09683846682310104] When at the restaurant, they gave me catchup that was so rancid it bubbled.
[-0.08348514139652252] Didn't try the restaurant....got there late!

[0.7397395968437195] The only downside is the cost of parking, which at $23 a day, is expensive compared to other cities.

[0.7397395968437195] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.7318812608718872] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.6523827910423279] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
[0.618786633014679] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.6043161153793335] The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot!

[-0.04733056575059891] THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.
[-0.025524647906422615] Was a great start to our mini vacation and looking forward now to seeing the falls.
[-0.02220042049884796] We did not have a room reserved and were happy they were able to take us without a reservation.
[-0.021137168630957603] The restaurant buffet for breakfast was good, the wait staff was very pleasant.
[0.0008674114942550659] I did have breakfast in the morning in the restaurant beside the lobby area and was pleased with the level of service from the waiter and while he did make a small mistake on my order (he gave me potatoes when I asked for no potatoes), it was quickly rectified, and he continued to provide attentive service.
