[0.4997611939907074] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6107836961746216] Hotel was convenient to and from Miami airport via SuperShuttle ($16 to and from here) and to cruise ship at nearby port.
[0.5876050591468811] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.
[0.5724111795425415] The hotel is close to everything.
[0.5662246346473694] The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun.

[0.6273335814476013] I also had great meals in the restuarant with good quality and service delivered by the staff.
[0.6117331385612488] The restaurant on the main level was excellent, had a variety of food and drinks.
[0.6078729629516602] Although - taking a tip from a previous poster - dine at the Bistro - 1/2 price on some of the appetizers and reasonably priced sandwiches.

[0.5525583028793335] Some reviewers thought the location was convenient, while others found it to be uninteresting and away from the main tourist attractions.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5525583028793335] Give it 4 out of 5 for location, but 2 out of 5 for service.
[0.5433247685432434] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.5420711040496826] On-site restaurant was simply okay, surrounding neighborhood was very blah, and the staff was ambivalent.

[0.6488182544708252] Some tips: The parking is very expensive - $35 for valet and $25 for self-park.
[0.5758765935897827] I also did not care for the $28/ day parking fee.
[0.5739048719406128] High parking rates unless you get park & stay AAA rate (I did).
[0.5555646419525146] When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore.
[0.541901171207428] The only complaint I have is the required $28 per day for parking, but this is Miami and any decent place will charge you for parking.

[0.5985532999038696] Unless you have a rental car, you're at the mercy of taxis to find an interesting neighborhood since this one is so bland.
[0.5535911917686462] Hotel location is away from the main tourist attractions (Bayside Marketplace, Miami beaches).
[0.5520046353340149] The location is not that good for the regular tourist with no car but a Metromover station is nearby.
[0.5423135757446289] The only drawback is that near by the hotel you do not have any life, and the park option is expensive 28 usd.

[0.7193784713745117] Parking is absurd.
[0.6946227550506592] Valet parking was over $25.
[0.6912326216697693] Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs.
