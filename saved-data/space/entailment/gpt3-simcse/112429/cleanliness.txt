[0.7055848836898804] The room was not clean when the reviewer arrived, and housekeeping did not come by until later in the day.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7055848836898804] When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30.
[0.5449292659759521] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.4901902377605438] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
[0.48109936714172363] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
[0.4587227702140808] I notified the front desk to make sure it was cleaned at some point.

[0.5590649843215942] There were also some concerns about the sanitation of the shampoo and conditioner dispensers in the shower.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5590649843215942] I don't like the shampoo and conditioner dispenser attached to the wall in the shower though.
[0.44878917932510376] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.
[0.41938328742980957] They just seem unsanitary to me.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5071873664855957] I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.
[0.47566497325897217] The hotel even allowed us to check in early (1:00) which was nice because we had just arrived back in Seattle from our Alaskan cruise (the only negative which is why I'm giving Service 4 stars instead of 5 was the girl at the front desk who offered another couple more options about checking in early--which floor and view they wanted, which was not offered to us...whatever...).
[0.4392426908016205] My companion and I stayed at this hotel because it was one of the most affordable on the day we went.
[0.40991514921188354] The only aspect of the hotel that could be improved, in my opinion, is the fitness center -- it's in the basement and has older equipment.

[0.4656067192554474] The heater came off and on frequently and it made a jarring clicking noise each time...all night long.
[0.43476003408432007] The thermostat was worn so you could not tell which setting was A/C and which was heat.
