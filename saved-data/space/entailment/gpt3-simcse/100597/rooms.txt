[0.5849412679672241] Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.

[0.7554271221160889] Some reviewers noted that the hotel is near the airport, so it can be noisy at night.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7554271221160889] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.6298353672027588] This hotel is a nice size and is convenient to the airport and restaurants.
[0.586978554725647] It's an ok hotel by any other standards but nice compared to what's close by.

[0.6533341407775879] Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room.
[0.6502164602279663] Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.
