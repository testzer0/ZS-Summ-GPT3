[0.6362636685371399] There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.
[0.6196472644805908] The room was comfortable and well-equipped...except for a small fridge that I was unable to obtain during my stay.
[0.6171078681945801] The rooms are spacious and beds very comfortable, unfortunately there was no bottled water in the room which was disappointing given the hotel standard but this is my only downside of the stay.
