[0.7114126682281494] However, some reviewers said that the shuttle bus to the theme parks was not always on time, and that it could be difficult to get a seat on the bus.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7114126682281494] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
