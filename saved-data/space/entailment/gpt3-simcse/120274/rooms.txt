[0.7043033838272095] Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative.
[0.6935475468635559] Complimentary breakfast was mediocre, I'd rather go to some nearby restaurant's breakfast buffets for $4++/person.
