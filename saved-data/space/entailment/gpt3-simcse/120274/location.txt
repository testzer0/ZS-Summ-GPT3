----- Supporting -----

[0.6390729546546936] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.61166912317276] The only okay thing about the hotel was the location.
[0.6014056205749512] The hotel is not very hard to find.

[0.029297109693288803] P.s sanford airport hasnt got scales to weigh cases before you check in!!
[0.041218288242816925] I went down to get some ice and found I needed to return to the room to obtain a quarter... ice was not free.

[0.004223423078656197] Firstly, reception won't really care as we found them quite surely and unhelpful, and secondly the rooms are not gleaming and smelling of rose petals!
[0.012967648915946484] Not much, but you have to bring a quarter to fill your ice-bucket, annoying if you don't know this and have to walk back to your room to find change.
