[0.6918116807937622] The reviews said that the building was in poor condition, with a musty odor, and that it was confusing to navigate.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6918116807937622] However, when we went into the building....the musty odor was horrible, the lobby area was humid as if the air conditioning wasn't on, the elevator smelled musty.
[0.5640602707862854] There are 3 different buildings in which one can stay, I found it confusing and the building we were in was the a long walk to the Front desk and where breakfast was.
[0.5036218166351318] The exterior doors had problems locking.
[0.5030602216720581] There were dead bugs floating in the water, a hole in the wall under the window, a piece of wood holding a slide glass door open, chains on other doors that said "this entrance is in need of repairs, sorry for any inconvenience" or something to that affect.
[0.45746150612831116] I was told the place had been remodeled, I guess they meant new paint which is all dark colors and new carpet.
