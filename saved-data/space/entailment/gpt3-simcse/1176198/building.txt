[-0.03475221246480942] Never again will I waste money at this property.
[0.04422866553068161] There were weird grease marks on the wall as well.

[0.5309480428695679] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[0.3406047821044922] The descriptions of the neighborhood other reviewers made in the past are correct: there are some questionable-looking people, but that is just one of the elements of any big city.
[0.28885945677757263] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[0.28688040375709534] Lobby was a little small and at times quite crowded, but once you pass through that it was a non-issue.
[0.2850766181945801] The lobby is also small.

[0.5997130870819092] There have been some issues with the fire alarm going off.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5997130870819092] The only bad things that i can mention are that during my stay another guest decided to set the fire alarm of at 04:30, not a wake up call I want to repeat.

[0.3501099944114685] We had to call the front desk to figure out what exactly was going on.
[0.27296188473701477] (once we figured out how to work all the shower heads) The walls were very thin though-we could really hear our neighbours mini party at 2AM in the morning.
