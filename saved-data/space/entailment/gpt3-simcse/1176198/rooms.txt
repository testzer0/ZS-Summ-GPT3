[0.6617715954780579] Many parties going on in hotel with loud music and screaming.
[0.5958465933799744] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.

[0.744870662689209] The only negative thing I would have to say would be regarding the small size of the bathroom.
[0.6644883155822754] The bathroom is too small.
[0.5157642364501953] In the bathroom you feel like you are in a space capsule and these are a little cramped but lets face it how much time do you spend in a bathroom...in and out right!
[0.4914311468601227] For some this may not be an issue, but also be aware, most rooms do not have bathtubs, just standup showers, so if you like to bath or have children who you need to bath, this is likely not the best choice.
[0.48950740694999695] Pros: room very clean and well-lit; staff extremely helpful; extra comfortable beds (probably one of the best hotel beds I've slept in) Cons: room internet was very slow except for very basic email checks; breakfast room was understaffed so that two frantic staff-members were running around looking very flustered and struggling to deal with all the guests

[0.6394052505493164] Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.
[0.6159642338752747] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.
[0.6140073537826538] Room was very comfortable, good location for sightseeing in Toronto, breakfasts cooked to order, and all went well until the third night when the nightclub next door went into action.
[0.5930802822113037] I suggest you ask for a room on a high floor as there is a noisy club South of the hotel on the ground floor.
