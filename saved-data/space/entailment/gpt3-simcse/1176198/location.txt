----- Supporting -----

[0.6611231565475464] The Only drawback of this hotel is that usage of Business Center is a bit expensive and so is the Restauant in the hotel for the qulaity of food.
[0.5777817964553833] Another thing is try to avoid the public parking across the hotel.
[0.5576376914978027] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended

[0.7982990741729736] Some caveats: The valet parking [only option] is $35 CAD.
[0.7678883075714111] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
[0.7523771524429321] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.
[0.6994096040725708] Paid $35.00 to park overnight across the street.
[0.634702205657959] The man there told us that at the hotel we can park the car for $35 and had to take it out before 1 pm whereas we can park it for $40 in his parking until 3 pm.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6306028366088867] The hotel is close enough to the big attractions to be convenient but still is not in an overly busy/loud part of town which was nice.
[0.625288724899292] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.

[0.8527168035507202] Parking rates are high, but this is expected in a city center.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8527168035507202] Parking rates are high as you will find in all major cities around the world.
[0.8027395009994507] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.
[0.7385451793670654] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[0.6935650110244751] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
