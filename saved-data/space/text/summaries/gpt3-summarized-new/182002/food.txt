Part 1 of 3: The coffee shop in the lobby has wonderful baked goods. The food they serve is good as well.
Part 2 of 3: The food at the hotel is good, but it is very expensive. The Tim Hortons in the lobby is convenient for coffee. There is a decent diner to the left of the hotel and a great little Thai restaurant on the other side and around the corner.
