***** Model produced summary *****
Overall, reviewers thought the hotel was comfortable, although some furniture was a bit old. They also thought it was a good value. It is recommended to get a car, as it can be difficult to get around without one. The complex has a very cheap mall.

The person at the front desk met all are requests... a quiet room away from the traffic.
Small gift/corner shop, internet access.
Ok so the furniture was a bit tired but stuff worked, plenty of hot water and there was a microwave and fridge in the room.
I would certainly reccomend this property to anyone who desires a comfortable "sleeper" at a great price
Hotel shop is very expensive so be warned.
A must is a car because travelling around on foot is hard the roads are really hard to cross you take your life into your own hands and wait up to 15 mins for the lights to change and watch the traffic from the right because while your crossing they are too.
The furniture, i.e tv unit and clothes drawers seemed to be the only thing that seemed a little tired, but not so much that you would notice.
We never used the hotel shuttle bus as we hired a car.
VERY cheap mall , we walked in and walked out right away.
30$ cab ride to florida mall.
A car will definitely be handy.
The property though was not nice at all.
We would have struggled without the hire car so I would advise you to get one!
We have been to this complex a number of times.
When we arrived, although the front desk staff could not find our reservation, I showed them my confirmation sheet and they fixed everything.
