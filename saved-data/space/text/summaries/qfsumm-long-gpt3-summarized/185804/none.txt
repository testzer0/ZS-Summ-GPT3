The reviewers said that the food at the hotel was excellent, both in terms of room service and in the restaurants. They also said that there were plenty of excellent places to eat fresh seafood on the island.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The restaurant food ranges from delicious and superb to pretty good and just o.k, but mostly seems to be greatly enjoyed. They have a microbrewery on site. The room service is also excellent.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
Coupled with great service, the food is excellent in the restaurant downstairs.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
Food from room service as well as Dockside restaurant was good.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
They asked me if I wouldn’t mind waiting as they offered to make it from scratch… highly worth the wait.
The food is excellent and the view is amazing.
Luckily we had our own wine, and raided the mini bar for some munchies.
Luckily we had our own wine, and raided the mini bar for some munchies.
Water Taxi's and walking paths are right there if you want to head out to English Bay or Yaletown.
The market itself is so interesting and the food is wonderful.
For old times sake, we even had lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory, but the food wasn't very good, so we decided to give the city a miss and pootle around the Island instead .
Really rocking and that's not a bad thing eh :) But chasing down something to eat this late on the island was hopeless.
The market is a must go too.
It's a really cool market.
The two water taxis companies serving Granville Island make it very accessible to downtown as well.
I didn't have any meals at the hotel so can't comment on that.
There are several shops and plenty of excellent places to eat FRESH seafood, including the Dockside Restaurant and pub (microbrew).
Food/service was faultless.
I thought the penthouse was well worth the money for a romantic stay compared to the other hotels we considered.
Needed to stay in Vancouver for 3 nights for a health review at UBC.
My husband tried a different beer each night that was micro-brewed at the hotel.
Do people actually still use those liquor fridges?...
There are a variety of options at a reasonable price.
They served everything from made-to-order Eggs Benedict to fruit and pastries to salmon and bacon and fresh-made waffles and...
The food and service were outstanding.
Food is fab too!
We needed to be able to provide some of our own food, so asked to have the mini bar emptied so we could use the fridge, and for a microwave, although it wasn't a regular part of the room.
The food is excellent ( both room service and in the resto) and they have a micro brewery on site.
Our evening snack on the patio was delicious, relaxing and we had a lovely server...again most helpful and obliging...and the view!
The room was beautiful, the staff were very pleasant and the food from the restiarant Downstairs was delicious.
Awesome food, service and view!
However the soap was a good and generous size.
* Way over priced and not the price I had booked online Overall this is a good choice for the location and if it is within your budget, just don't expect too much.
In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.
The food was superb, and the atmosphere is wonderful - right on the water.
Also, there is a brewery on site, and some of the beers were great.
you could easily spend most of your time there since there are lots of restaurants and a fantastic public market featuring lots of food.
quiet at night without the often ugly street level scene you encounter at more glamorous high-rises (yes the high-rises can give you great views but coming out at street level you feel like you've walked into a seedy bus station environment).
The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.
We ate them in the sunshine by the water, looking at the Vancouver skyline.
I expect more considering the price.
The event I attended had a lunch and reception in the restaurant and the food was fantastic.
I probably wouldn't eat there though if I was paying for it myself as the menu was pretty expensive and there are several great places to eat elsewhere on the Island.
We ate at the restaurant for breakfast once and had room service as well.
Both were good.
so that when we bought food to bring back to the room, we had nothing to eat it with.
Food services are excellent.
The food market made me wish I was cooking and not eating out at restaurants!
I disagree: the beers are lightweight.
If you want to visit downtown just take the water taxi or "aqua bus" these little boats are fun, not very expensive and the quickest way to gt there.
It was a bottle of wine with a miniature tuxedo jacket around the bottle.
We shared a steak in a beautiful setting of a table of two with a good view of the waterfront and a candle on the table.
Every day we would get up and walk the short walk to the "Public Market" and have our breakfast or lunch.
We ate there the night before the wedding, and were not disappointed.
Great food and great service.
Basically a food market and some specialist shops.
The market may be unique in North America, but in the UK most towns and cities have a market at least as good.
The beer brewed on the premises was also very good.
The food is acceptable, but don't expect gourmet.
They also have pet friendly rooms with tiled floors.
Being on the water, there is never a lack of things to do or see.
On the weekend, we especially enjoy items on the brunch menu.
The in room breakfast was exceptional and reasonably priced as were the items in the mini-bar.
Right on the water.
take waterbus for a few dollars and go where you like.
Food isnt great but you are right by the market.
***** Model produced summary *****
The reviewers generally enjoyed their stay at the hotel, finding it to be a relaxing oasis in the city with a down-home feeling. They appreciated the proximity to the city and the theatre package, and found the food to be delicious. They also enjoyed the view from their room and the friendly staff. One reviewer noted that the hair dryer provided was not very powerful, but otherwise had no complaints and would happily return.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
A tiny problem, but big when you are in a hurry: offer better hair dryers than the low-powered one provided.
There actually isn't any; the bedside lamp is too dim to read by.
We hope to be back soon.
And the best part is- it's dog friendly!
My mutt loves Granville Island!
I’ve been here for nine days and I couldn’t be happier.
Granville Island is an oasis inside a city.
I bought my husband a "weekend getaway/theatre package" for Christmas, which included an executive suite at the Granville Island Hotel, dinner at the hotel, and tickets to a theatre production.
It was outstanding.
We didn't even turn on either of the two TV's while there - we just sat and looked out the window at the ever changing scenery.
Overall a great weekend experience, and we will definately be back.
I have stayed here on business, with Family and with friends and no one has ever been anything but totally impressed.
It's near enough to the city yet has a different feel - probably because the Island is a working place, not just a tourist trap.
It's also great to see the students at the Emily Carr Institute.
And Man!
Was that a great reason to stay here.
I don't care where you've been in your travels.
Hope this helps!
If you want to walk/cycle - it doesn't get better the the walking/cycling trails leading away from Granville Island.
My wife and I just concluded our 4 day stay at this hotel and loved every minute of it.
Granville Island is actually a little peninsula (more like a giant pier) with a very laid back feel to it, complete with a down-home fresh foods market, like something you would see in the movies.
Deserves a huge 5 stars.
Cannot wait to go back.
Most comfortable week I have spent anywhere.
It was all lovely, beautiful venue with the patio and city and water view, delicious food, all the guests and a great time!
What better place to be than Granville Island.
We are a 40-something couple travelling with 3 small children.
Unbelievable.
Our girls loved the decent-sized hot tube with the windowed ceiling that allowed us to watch the starts at night.
I travel a lot for business and I always look forward to staying at the Granville because I always get what I expect which is good value for the money and a very nice stay.
Will keep coming back without a doubt!
All in all a good stay.
We had chosen it based on the reviews on the Trip advisor web site.
I cannot understand it's high rating on this site.
This time I planned ahead and we had an amazing time both at the hotel and enjoying all that Granville Island has to offer!
You can walk to everything on granville island and there is a lot to see and do there.
If we return to the area I would definitely stay here again.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel if you wish to be in the Granville Island area.
Granville Island itself has restuarants of its own, a wonderful public market and quaint boutiques.
If we have to pick something we missed, and it's hard to do, we would have loved a hot tub on premises.
In 2004 my daughter was back East with her dad's family for Christmas and I just couldn't stomach the idea of spending another holiday with my then-significant other's nice but guarded family in an overheated home where conversation never goes deeper than discussion of recipes, jobs and weather.
I make my reservations in August, typically.
I arrive early in the day on Christmas Eve to be sure to have plenty of time for the market and other fun shops on the island before they close for the holiday.
It's such a wonderful experience!
It was amazing!
When the holiday routine takes it toll, take your break at the Granville.
I'll see you dockside.
-Elaine
The mini bar was stocked sufficiently with a wide variety of refreshments and snacks.
This also allowed us to research events and activities and various places to visit for the following day.
It was a pleasure to work with the team at the Granville Island Hotel to set up 2 days of catered meetings.
From reviewing the meeting room options to choosing menus and getting setup, the process was fast and smooth.
Both experiences were excellent.
Me and my family of 3 (Myself, Wife & Son) loved staying on Granville Island.
When we return to Vancouver we will be stating at the property again.
I stayed here for 5 days at an educational "intensive".
Granville Island itself is very interesting, although I didn't have enough time to really explore.
We're locals, but spend Christmas at the hotel each year, with our 3 (large) dogs and cat.
With the hectic run up to Christmas ( I usually end up having to work right up to about 3 on the 24th), the arrival at the hotel is usually accompanied by a deep sigh... we're home!
We recently had an extremely bad stay at an American Sheraton hotel, and were a bit gunshy about staying in ANY hotel again...haha.
Ach, beautiful!!
But that's our fault!
Thanks again!
My 11 year old daughter marvelled at the Toy Store, loved the food fudge vendors and even the buskers tunes.
I'd highly recommend this hotel.
The Big Bus hop onhop off goes fairly close to the hotel (5-7 min walk) Live Music played most nights from Restaurant which while very good when you have a full day and want to sleep it would go until about midnight.
Would recommend to any traveller
My two kids loved walking through the island each day to get back to the hotel.
Would definitely return!
Highly enjoyed our stay and the next time we have the money to go out for a nice weekend again, we will definitely be going back here :)
In no way was this a three star hotel.
We left that night for a better place.
It's those kinds of perks which make people decide to return.
Oh, my gosh.
The views of South Downtown are amazing (see pics).
We had an awesome experience.
The room had outstanding views.
My wife and I truly enjoyed our stay and we love the atmosphere of the public market.
I made a list while staying there Good Points * Great location and really only hotel in the kitsilano area and only one on GI * Comfortable bed * Lots of drawer space in bathroom * Good selection in mini bar ie.
We could hear chairs and people moving around in the adjoining room as if it was in our room mostly because of the echoing from the marble floors.
The room was in a very quiet section of the property but the noise factor was a problem because of the large space in the threshold of the door and the rooms on either side.
The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.
This is a great hotel and obviously a favorite with discerning locals having events...they weren't really an obstruction to our having a great time, but did become something of a joke as both the hotel and adjoining park/marina/galleries are dripping with wedding parties.
We travelled with 4 kids and still had a terrific, romantic weekend!
Keep-up the good work.
Arthur Colman.
My wife and I had a bad experience at GIH.
I would not recommend this to my friends or family.
Think twice if you are going to plan an event there, or at least go in warned!
Recommended
We love going to Granville Island, but never have enough time to explore all of the nooks and crannies of this interesting place.
It rained all four days that we were there in mid-July, which is fairly unusual for this time of year.
Maybe do a taste test first.
The bed was quite comfortable, but the A/C a bit noisy.
No worries....
We were tipped off to the Property by some good friends.
Love this place!
The one drawback is that it's not that well insulated, sound-wise.
I could hear the seagulls in the morning, and if there's a party in the hotel, you might want to bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper.
We brought friends who had never been to your hotel, and they raved about it too.
Thanks for the comfortable and friendly stay-------------------we'll be back!

A design school campus brings a funky element to the scene as well as individual artist studios.
We had our wedding reception at GI Hotel last week and couldn't have been more thrilled with the location, venue, food and overall service excellence that we received.
We were so comfortable in the hotel that it was hard to leave it to join our cruise ship (where the bed was far less comfortable).
Check in was easy.
I declined and had no problems.
Granville Island is so fun and there is so much to walk to and check out.
Staying on Granville Island you can walk to the public market every morning and you're just a bus ride into downtown.
Our stay was very satisfactory.
Overall, a very pleasant experience.
We booked this hotel on the basis of the tripadvisor reviews and it exceeded expectations.
That took us to downtown, Yaletown, the Science centre, the Space museum... and then we just walked.
I stayed here after all the rave reviews.

Being on Granville Island is a real treat.
We love Granville Island and everything it has to offer--the botique shops, public market, restaurants, theaters, and its central location in Vancouver.
The Hotel was remodeled for the 2010 Olympics.
We actually walked home one night from the GM Center, a half-hour walk.
It was exceptionally noisy.
On returning i found the key went missing from the lock I had secured to the bike.
they did agree.
Great fun for us and would be good for a family.
And they takes dogs.
Simply a lovely time for us and the sun shone!
!
A relaxed and comfortable place for families or couples.
HOWEVER, everything else was lovely.
In one part of the room, we could lay on the sofa watching television while we watched the world passing by through the large window.
I found the best gift for my friend at the Okanagan Wine Shop.
If you've never been to Granville Island in Vancouver, you should definitely stay at the Granville Island Hotel.
It was delightful!
My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
All in all, though, a very lovely stay.
Granville Island is captivating with its arts, crafts, music and market!!
Beautiful scenes abound.
Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
Enjoy!
It's even better in the early morning, before all of the people arrive for the day, when you feel you have the place to yourself.
Staying at the Granville Island Hotel, the only hotel on the island, lets you experience both personalities of Granville Island.
Friendly, clean, quiet...what more can you ask for?
Great views of False Creek.
Would stay again in a heartbeat.
I checked in no problem and they gave us a room they was sort of facing the water.
We stayed 3 nights.
They told us they thought it was a false alarm...Granville Island is a great place to visit w/kids - lots to do and a fun water park.
Granville Island is a wonderful oasis of calm right in the middle of Vancouver, there are shops, restaurants and sights all around.
Perfect
The hotel provides some wonderful views of the harbour and the rooms are modern and clean.
One of my favourite weekend retreats.
Granville Island is a shoppers bazaar by day for gifts, clothing, groceries, baked goods, quick snacks, sophisticated dining, aboriginal art and more and also popular among locals and tourists alike.
The evenings are quiet and perfect for a good nights sleep.
I couldn't have been happier with my "misfortune".
My one suggestion would be to get some in-room movies but I would definietly stay at GIH again.
We loved everything about Granville Island.
I would definitely recommend this hotel.
What a great place!
Overall it was an excellent stay, we will definitely do it again.
It features a children's carnival, which is great for families, but not very appealing to business travelers.
I thoroughly recommend it on all fronts.
Thank you for a wonderful, relaxing stay.
Sounds terrible but its not.
