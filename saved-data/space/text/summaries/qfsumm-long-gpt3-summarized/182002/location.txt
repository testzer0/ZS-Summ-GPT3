***** Model produced summary *****
The location was good for some people, being close to restaurants, a mall, and other attractions. However, others found the location to be less than ideal, with expensive parking and difficult to find public parking.
***** Golden Review 1 *****
The hotel is in a great location, close to the CN Tower, the museum, Rogers Centre, Yonge Street, and the Hockey Hall of Fame. It's also less than 10 minute walk to subway station. Area was pretty cool too, great for shopping, dining & partying. There are lots of restaurants in walking distance, with a great Chinese place right across the street.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
Great location, close to CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Yonge Street, and the Hockey Hall of Fame, and it's a few block's walk away from the subway station, unless one prefers to catch a cab out front. Restaurants are also within walking distance, with a great Chinese place across the street.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The hotel is in a great location on Carlton/College Ave. and we were close to the CN Tower, the museum and the Hockey Hall of Fame. There lots of little restaurants in walking distance (great Chinese place right across the street.). public transportation is easily accessible at this location, too. The location is great for shopping, dining & partying.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
It was in a good location on Carlton/College Ave.
It was only a few blocks east of Yonge St.
The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
Would stay there again as price was great and location perfect.
The place was in a good location and I was able to walk to a huge mall and what I guess is Torontoâ€™s equivalent of Times Square.
There was a great Thai restaurant too called Jasmine Gardenâ€™s if anyone out there is into Thai food.
Being from out of town, we drove to Toronto to spend a nice week-end.
Before checking in, they rudely told us that the parking space we had requested had been given to someone else and that we were to go down the street to public parking lot.
THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.
It took 10 minutes before another hotel representative came on to give us proper directions.
I would not reccomend this place to even my worst ennemies.
The "self parking" amenity translates as $23 per night in hotel parking lot!
It was full when I got there and had to get a "pass" to park in the employees parking lot in the back alley!
The window looking at a fantastic view north was so grimy it was hard to see through (finger and nose prints all over it) We just kept the net curtains closed so we couldn't see them and enjoyed the night lights instead.
The location is good being a short walk into town and is close to the new Loblaws food emporium at Maple Leaf Gardens.
It was close to the theatre we were going to and the price was affordable.
We mentioned on check in that it was our anniversary and were immediately upgraded from our room with 1 double to a king room on the highest floor with a wonderful view of the city.
They were also kind enough to recommend and make reservations at a lovely restaurant called Ruth Chris (pricey but well worth it if you are a steak lover).
The hotel was in a great location and we walked to a charming area called Yorkville.
The hotel was in a good location and was close to restaurants and a wonderful greenhouse which I toured for an entire afternoon.
I did have breakfast in the morning in the restaurant beside the lobby area and was pleased with the level of service from the waiter and while he did make a small mistake on my order (he gave me potatoes when I asked for no potatoes), it was quickly rectified, and he continued to provide attentive service.
Was a nice place.
We didnâ€™t use the restaurant as there was a place next door which served an all day breakfast for cheap so we slept in and went there one morning.
From the map it looked like it was pretty much in the middle of the downtown area and the rate was cheaper than some of the other hotels.
They had a restaurant but we didnâ€™t use it and opted for a quick coffee and muffin at the coffee shop beside the lobby.
First impression, it was in a decent area, not too far from the central part of downtown with all the restaurants and I thought ok, not too bad.
We then checked in and were told that the parking garage was full and that I could park on the street.
For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not.
After circling the hotel trying to find a parking spot which I eventually did about 1/4 mile from the hotel (on the street), a bum waited in front of my car asking for money.
As far as the location goes, it was close to everything with maybe a couple of extra short blocks of walking which we didn't mind at all.
Bankok Garden on Elm st. is wonderful for Thai.
it is right on Younge down near Dundas.
As other reviewers are saying, the place needs a facelift fast.
The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).
Our room was good, the bed very good - but it was disappointing to find that the "new and exciting Primrose Restaurant and Bar where no expense had been spared" (according to their brochure) was CLOSED except for breakfast time.
Our room had a south view of the city with a fantistic view of downtown and the lake.
The underground parking in the hotel was $15 a day, but you do get in/out privileges, just use caution when parking, it's a bit tight down there.
The Hotel is in walking distance to most major attractions and the public transportation is easily accessible.
The yearly family vacation happened in Toronto this time.
My wife and I really enjoy this time we have to spend with the kids while they still think these trips are "cool".
It is handy to shopping and night life â€“ but so are many other hotels from which to choose.
The one good thing that came about from our stays at this hotel was finding The Golden Greek Restaurant which is in the lower part of the building next door.
This restaurant has a loyal group of customers.
So this family vacation was a short stop in Toronto and then onto Niagara falls.
The restaurant was also a great deal since our kids ate free from the buffet since they are younger.
Was a great start to our mini vacation and looking forward now to seeing the falls.
Heed this warning stay away from this crappy place, you'll be glad you did.
We had chosen this hotel as it was downtown and they were able to give us a discounted group rate as we had 17 rooms in total.
It is in a great location and was able to walk to some great restaurants and shopping places.
When at the restaurant, they gave me catchup that was so rancid it bubbled.
So we went to Toronto for some girl time and had a fantabulous time.
The lady in reception was very helpful and kind, she got us a very good room at a reasonable price.
The parking garage was a little tight to drive around in, but other than that, I would definately go back for another weekend with the guys.
I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
I was surprised to find that the area itself was a bit seedy.
The view was great.
The only gripe I had really, was that the bar shut very early & we couldn`t get a beer when we returned after our night on the town.
The general location was very close to the downtown area.
I was surprised to find what amounted to an underground shopping city that stretched all the way down to the waterfront.
We were on the 22nd floor and the view was to die for.
Also the hotel was in a very good location for all attractions.
Last weekendâ€™s trip to Toronto seemed to have broken my run of bad luck.
Was a good trip, especially our visit to the Hockey Hall of Fame (definitely the place to go if you have sons who live and breathe hockey) and the staff were great.
While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
The restaurant buffet for breakfast was good, the wait staff was very pleasant.
My family has said that we should return at some other time.
There are all manner of things to do, within easy walking distance of Yonge St and the Eaton Centre, the subway is right there, and all kinds of bars and hotspots within easy reach.
All in all, a great place to go for some fun times in Toronto!
Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.
We did not have a room reserved and were happy they were able to take us without a reservation.
We were pleased with the choice, and the location was perfect.
The hotel was close to some of the places we visited (Hockey Hall of Fame the clear winner with the kids).
The underground parking is horribly laid out.
I would stay here again but I would park elsewhere.
The hotel itself is in a good location.
While we werenâ€™t right on the main street (Yonge Street), it was literally only 2 blocks away, and took less then 3 minutes to get there.
The location of the hotel is not too far away from the College Subway station.
It comes very useful if you don't want to drive in downtown.
The station is about 300 yards west of the hotel.
Since I metioned driving, I must mention parking in the hotel.
By the time we arrived, all parking spots at the hotel were taken.
We were advised to park our car about 2 blocks away where there were no "in and out" priviledges.
Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.
This is not to complain about Tim Hortons in any way, but were were dissapointed of the "limited" menu they have had there.
The location was good, right where I needed to be, and the price was great for downtown and I only paid $89 with a corporate discount.
Location a few blocks from Yonge street where all the shops and restaurants are.
the one across the street from the "Made in China" chinese restaurant, which was decent cheap eats on it's own!
Close to CN tower too!
The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
If you have a van or larger vehicle forget parking here.
The ramps are very steep, the spots are narrow and the driving room is almost non-existent.
To get to the parking lot from the guest floors you will need to use an access card in the elevators; if you are not quick enough, or your card doesn't work properly, you will find that you are called to another floor.
It's close to the subway and one day we walked to the CN tower - didn't realize it was that close.
If you are in good shape, walking will get you to all the downtown attractions.
Just a couple of blocks away from Yonge & Dundas Square.
It is a great location to explore the city by foot.
I did ask if I just could use maybe a land line but no luck.
PS The hotel is right next to the redlight district too!
My wife and I just returned after a 5 day trip to Toronto.
The best thing about the room was its view.
We had a breathtaking view of downtown Toronto second only to the CN Tower view.
The College St subway stop is only a few blocks away.
The location was perfect as I walked to the Eaton Centre which was about 10 minutes away, and then the cab ride back only cost $8 including a tip.
My husband myself and 13 year old son stayed here June 10-13.
There was a restraunt in the hotel but we never eat there.
surrounded by great restauants and a healthy walking distance to shops, Air Canada Centre, CN Tower.
The hotel was in a good location and it was easy to get a cab just outside the hotel to the clubs.
If you are staying here be warned about the parking though.
Its really tight down there, but there is also a public lot outside which you can use.
I drive a smaller car so had no issues, but I think someone in a mini van might have trouble.
I didn't eat at the restaurant, so can't comment on that.
I am participating in the student residence program and my first thought was that it would be awsome living in a hotel.
Also,if you are planing to stay here for student residence don't make it your first choice, please look around maybe stay in a dorm or something.
Great location, close to CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Yonge Street, Hockey Hall of Fame.
Subway is within walking distance.
I thought the hotel was in a good location and I found it was easy to walk to restaurants at night.
Across the street from the old Maple Leaf Gardens, and it looks like a new grocery store is about to open up there soon.
The hotel is not in a nice area of the city and you will notice a great deal of sketchy personalities roaming the streets around the area.
I did not trust the underground parking facilities so made sure to bring all my bags and valuables up to my room.
The hotel had a restaurant but it looked to be closed when we went to eat.
The rest of the area I would not trust to walk alone at night and there is not a great deal to do other than take a taxi west where the true city begins.
It is worth noting that the parking garage has very little clearance, and some of the tightest turns I have ever had to negotiate.
The hotel is in a nice location, within walking distance of everything touristy.
The location is great.
Close enough to walk to the Eaton Centre.
The subway station is only a few blocks away and the street car passes right in front of the hotel.
Went on Bestwestern.com and booked the room online for $89.00 a night.
The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car.
Was very safe and you could only access the parking lot with a hotel key.
A Cora's breakfast and Starbucks was two blocks away.
Didn't try the restaurant....got there late!
This hotel is near everything; subway, restaurants, shopping.
I parked my car in the garage for two days and took the subway.
Location is very central.
The first night there was no parking garage spot available, so we parked were the hotel recommended.
The next day when we moved into the garage the attendant said we should never have parked in the previous location because everyone should know that your car would be a target there.
They also tried to charge me with an extra night's garage parking and I had to get a manager involved to avoid the extra night's charge.
I couldn't believe they were trying to stick me for a charge when I hadn't been able to park in the garage, the spot was supposed to be free, the spot was recommended by the hotel staff, AND my car was broken into while parked there.
Only good thing was that it was a few blocks from the subway.
The location is good and it was close to a great Thai food restaurant which I would recommend if you like Thai.
We decided to surprise our kids and took them to Toronto for a few days for some family time last Christmas holidays.
We booked a room online at the Primrose Hotel as we are familiar with the brand and the standards they adhere to.
The hotel is in a great location and we were close to the CN Tower, the museum and the Hockey Hall of Fame.
It was a great mini vacation and something we plan to do again in the summer.
The downside is outside the area it is a bit rough with people standing about smoking and hanging out.
Overall our event went well and we do plan to hold our next meeting in the same room.
Shame they couldn't have arranged the weather!!
The hotel is within an easy walk to many attractions and shops, with a subway station close by for venturing further afield.
The view overlooked the downtown area and was close to hospitals if you were up for a brisk walk.
-Restaurant (Was not regularly opened.
We did not use the restaurant in the hotel but did enjoy the Tim Hortons coffee shop beside the check in area.
The hotel is situated in a good area and walking distance to Eaton Centre and many other attractions.
We were there for a Chicago concert at Massey Hall and it was about a ten minute walk.
I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
