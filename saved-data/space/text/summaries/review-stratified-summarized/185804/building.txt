***** Golden Review 1 *****
Nice modern 5 star hotel rooms with beautiful view of the waterfront. Excellent restaurant with deck looking at the charming Granville Island.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
A modern, boutique-esque, five star look for both the hotel and restaurant. All of it is surrounded by the charming waterfront.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The building is very modern, giving it the feel of a 5 star boutique hotel. It has a beautiful view of the city and waterfront, including the view from the deck of the building's excellent ground floor restaurant.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed!
He was very impressed and requested a tour of the brewery, which the brew-master provided for him.
It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime.
It was a fun, informative, and flexible way to view the entire city.
The computer and printer located in the lobby for guests to use was very helpful.
The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly.
We arrived a little late on Xmas day after a troublesome time with the car rental company (Budget did not have a car for me despite having a valid reservation).
Bad Points * half renovated the common areas are nice, the bathrooms have no bath tubs but new bathrooms.
* Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
*The art in the rooms are old and are of Delta, why not GI?
You do have a art institute across the road.
The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.
granville island is a community in itself.
There is no easy chair.
The hotel's lobby was undergoing renovations at the time but it never created any issues with our stay.
I'd have given it 5 stars if only the desk chair hadn't had arms and been a royal pain to move around.
We went to the Pacific Culinary Institute and that was amazing!
Nothing a little renovation couldn't quickly take care of.
There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!)
