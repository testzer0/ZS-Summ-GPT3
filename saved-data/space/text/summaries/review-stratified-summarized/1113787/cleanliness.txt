This was part of the Starwood Luxury Collection, but having been dissappointed many times before, I did not expect much.
Check in staff was extremely courteous and actually escorted me to the elevators (instead of saying "turn left, then right..." as the front deks often does).
Everything was clean and well maintained.
Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
I again advised them when I checked in.
The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
We stayed two nights at the Joule.
We certainly did not get recognised for an upgrade as a Starwood Gold Member.
I had a rather loud banging on my door to find a maid who said (Who spoke little english) 'downturn you have ice".
Besides the carpet being a damp when we arrived it was perfect!
There are a lot of pluses - the feel, the location, the pool, Charlie Palmer, the service, the workout facilities.
I would definitely recommend the Joule.
Well decorated, sleek and modern.
They have the top of the line Beautyrest mattress which was really comfortable.
There is a sustainable energy theme in the hotel and Jessica and Brandon gave us the background story.
The sommelier at Charlie Palmers, Brandon was awesome.
Went to Joule for anniversary get-away.
We considered Ritz and Mansion on Turtle Creek but happily choice Joule.
Also for the ladies one of Dallas' best spas (Sedona - lady's only) is across the street but make sure and get appointment in advance as my wife couldn't get same day appointment on Saturday.
Also try brunch at Bread Winner's Cafe - just a short 3 miles away.
Their fitness facilities were nice with plenty of aerobic equipment and a enough weights to get in a nice workout.
The concierge drove us herself to the symphony when it was apparent that there was a traffic snafu that could render us late.
The concierge is very helpful and knows his stuff.
The decor is unique and the room layouts take a little getting used to, but I would highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.
I know that from Jennifer that checked us in with her welcoming smile we would have a good time.
I recently stayed at the Joule with some colleagues of mine.
You can finish the night off by going to the basement to the PM lounge for a night cap or walk a few blocks to half a dozen other clubs.
The concierge was very helpful with organizing assistance and cars etc, by email before we arrived.
The decor is exceptional and very modern.
I stayed at the Joule over the weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday and had a wonderful time!
I do think it is a lovely hotel but I would like to mention the lighting in the rooms was terrible.
And I canâ€™t wait to go back Good: â€¢ Amazing dÃ©cor throughout the hotel.
Bose iPod docs.
High quality toiletries.
They also provide two flutes for champagne.
We were treated like stars from the moment we pulled up to the valet.
The fitness center again was as nice as I've ever seen.
It was EXACTLY what we both needed, to relax and just enjoy ourselves fully without any stress.
Valet was pricey, but much preferred over worrying about my car in one of the nearby parking lots overnight.
Even as we exited the elevator to our floor, a housekeeping staff member assisted immediately in locating our room.
Stayed at this property the day before Valentines with my wife.
The decor is artsy and modern, great location, in a historic building.
Other than that no complaints, beautiful pool on the 10th floor and up to date fitness center with bottles of water and fruit.
The valet was wonderful, very helpful and polite.
We both needed to destress after a long week.
All of the details from the lobby theme and decor to the functional and modern bathrooms have been impeccably taken care of.
Modern and comfortable guestrooms.
Loved the low, medium & high settings on the lighting, this is great if you're not a morning person like myself!!
Loved the rose prosecco too :-) the decor was really fun and innovative throughout, like the large moving cogs by the check-in desk or the chairs in the lobby with sliding silver tables attached, or the secret reading lamp on the guestrooms headboards.
It was my birthday weekend and they sent champagne to the room - what a wonderful touch!
I had two problems with this place, first when I arrived home the day of our last stay I reviewed the invoice which had been emailed to me and was charged $202.00 for a dinner at Charlie Palmers, but we never dined at Charlie Palmers.
So overall I would recommend the hotel but just double check EVERYTHING on your invoice.
Biggest issue was when we picked up our car from the valet parking.
We brought this to the attention of the valet manager who said "we were very busy last night and had 8 or 9 guys parking cars.
I know this could happen anywhere but in years of valet parking it hasnt so this was quite annoying.
We saw another guest who was checking out looking at the back of his vehicle as well!
My kids especially liked the drapes the separated the bedroom from the bathroom area.
The chef generously shared the granola recipe with my husband, who declared it the best granola he'd even eaten.
The valet was very courteous (but very expensive at $27 a night) We had the King room on the 6th floor.
The housekeeper knocked on each door and handed out complimentary chocolates and bags of ice.
2) Visit the Poule at the Joule - Make sure to ask for Todd or Stephen & make sure to swim to the edge and overlook the city.
Clean.
I'm a simple southern girl and don't like anything too 'frou frou', but the waiter was incredibly patient and courteous.
The bartenders were atttentive.
When I was checking in Danielle had the most darling personality ever and was very swift.
I absolutely adored them both... Will def return!!!
We experienced true Southern hospitality from Todd and the rest of the incredible staff our entire trip.
Because of our time at the Joule and the incredible people, we are already planning our next trip back in a few months.
The doorman refused to allow us entry and we ended up waiting for almost an hour in the Texas heat while other folks would simply walk off the street and were immediately allowed in!
From moment we checked in to the a hand written card wishing us a happy anniversary to a great dinner at Charley Palmers it was a perfect experience.
Then upon check out our bill was suppose to be for $320 but they charged $388, they claimed it was a hold authorization...I've never had a hotel do that upon checkout.
Darrell went out of his way to make our visit extra special!
The valet just stood right next to me while I struggled with my luggage.
Once I was at the desk, I still was not offered any help with getting all my luggage to my room.
Upon check in, they knew (and remembered!)
it is always great when the doormen remember your name.
Well let me start by stating, Tripadvisor isn't such a friendly review system.
My only issue I had with my trip was the Conceirge Katie.
The decorum was awesome.
