***** Golden Review 1 *****
The rooms were, quiet and spacious but very basic with some odor. They were recently decorated and in a style similar to most US motel rooms. The room had twin beds, tv, safe, coffe maker, ironing board/iron, hair dryer, table and chairs, small dressing area, bath with shower. The air con worked great and the room had a TV with lots of channels and a free digital safe, fridge and microwave.
***** Golden Review 2 *****
The room was very basic with some odor. It seems like it wasn't getting aired. The room was recently nicely decorated and in a style similar to most US motel rooms with two large queen sized beds, window-mounted air conditioner mounted and came with safe, refrigerator and microwave. The A/C is noisy, but works well. Otherwise, the rooms are quite. The beds are comfortable. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfortable.
***** Golden Review 3 *****
The rooms were decorated like any other hotel, with two queen sized beds, a noisy air conditioner unit, a safe, a refrigerator, a microwave, and a large TV. There was plenty of space to comfortably fit four people. The beds were clean and bug free.
***** Sentences in Cluster ****
This was our 5th visit to Orlando and our first budget trip and i have to say that this little gem of a hotel is far superior to other more expensive ones in the area.
Our room had a brand new air conditioning unit which was quiter than the ones we are used to, a microwave, fridge, freezer, hairdryer, safe and TV.
The pool was a good size, very clean and looked out onto the lake.
I would highly recommend a trip to the Rainforest Cafe in Downtown Disney, Hardrock Cafe in Universal, Bennigans on I drive and Johnny Rockets at the Pointe they are all brilliant!!
Without a doubt I'd return to this hotel, it's superb value for money.
You hardly spend any time in your room anyway and it leaves you with more spending money for the shops and parks.
We usually stay on International Drive, but decided to give this hotel a try because of its proximity to Disney.
I have stayed at many 2 star hotels, but this one was the worst.
This is the 3rd time my family have stayed in this hotel & yes it does need a revamp & is a bit worn & tired but the staff are friendly & provide a good service.
I was disappointed that there was no breakfast, eventhough it was just toast & cereal it was a bonus, but there are many places to eat nearby.
This hotel is great for a good value stay in Orlando when visting the theme parks.
Breakfast, standard of rooms and pool were all far better than expected - I was very impressed.

First off...for $36 a night it was ok. Had we paid the $76 a night rate if we stayed any more days, it would have been a monumental rip off.
The room was clean and had plenty of towels.
The continental breakfast was a joke.
Three types of cereal, toast and waffles to eat, milk, coffee and juice.
No Danish, no fruit...nil, nada, nothing.
The breakfast lines were out of sight.
Worst "free" breakfast I have ever had.
There are many, many better choices for this area of Highway 192 near the Disney property.
I know this hotel is a great location and close to Disney but please....book one of the nicer hotels next door (The Best Western).
Let's just say...when you stay in a hotel, the minute you walk in to your room you shouldn't feel like you need to check the sheets and look under the mattresses first before you bring your luggage in - but for this place I definitely did.
The rooms are VERY outdated, smell terribly and don't even consider a room on the ground floor.
When we demanded another room it had bedbugs in the pillows.
My wife and I booked this hotel, sight unseen, due to some great internet pricing.
We were pleasantly surprised by the location and quality of the hotel.
Like some other reviewers have stated, there are a couple of shortcomings...the "Continental Breakfast" is stale bread, lousy toasters, cereal, coffee and orange juice.
Our ice machine was broken...beyond all that, though, we got a non-smoking room 2 miles from the Disney Main Gate for about $30 a night.
I would not stay here again!
We had a ground floor room on the opposite side from the pool, it smelled of damp and there was mold on the toilet wall.
The beds & towels were clean & as we were only there for a week & hardly spending any time in the hotel then we just put up with it.
It was just kind of old/dated & grimy!
I would not recommend this hotel really - it is very basic, so is the breakfast
Our room was cleaned daily, fresh bedding every day, the room was bug free and we had no proplems whatsoever and would have no hesitation about staying at this location again.
There were plenty of resturants nearby plus a supermarket for essentials, we would definately recommend this hotel to our friends
Room was okay, worn but very clean.
There is no fridge in the room, there is no coffee in the room, the safe in the room doesn't work.
It was truly unreal.
The pool is nice and clean.
The rooms are your basic hotel rooms - no fancy flat screen TV or dozens of channels - but it's clean and you have an elevator so you don't have to carry your luggage up the stairs.
The pool didn't look terribly promising and isn't very private, so I didn't use it.
I never made it to breakfast on time so can't comment on that.
This hotel was fine for a short while but I would not have wanted to spend my entire 10 day holiday here.
of this hotel looked pretty good.
After travelling around the world its the only place I ever encountered that the vermin would have moved out of.
Bottom line - do yourself a favor: NEVER STAY at this flea bag of a hotel.
We were given this room for free during our visit to Orlando.
I'm pretty sure they gave us this hotel so we can compare the 5 star accomadation to this dirty location.
Wife and I were given a room with 2 double beds, next to some car rental office.
Our toilet never flushed properly and the washrooms were dirty.
The room wasn't really that bad we were on the smoking floor (3rd floor) it was just very basic with a very small bathroom, there were always little ants around the sink area but no matter how many you washed away double the amount would come back.
They do a breakfast which does get very busy so all you need to do is take things up to your room, i think we managed to sit downstairs 3 times in 14 days.
All in all i would stay there again but would request having a fridge as all of the rooms do not have them and the ice machine played up alot.
Just returned from an amazing two weeks in Florida, I have see lots of poor reviews about this hotel, but wanted to defend it at bit.
Okay it's a bit tired and basic, but my god it is so cheap!
The rooms are cleaned spotlessly every day, fresh towels and linen are replaced daily.
The heated pool (important in January) is great spotlessly clean and really quiet.
Yes I know there are fancier hotels in Florida, this was our third time and we have stayed in everything from a villa to a nice hotel on International drive.
We had a car whilst over there but the hotel did have a shuttle bus to the major parks for those that don't drive.
We had the breakfast 1 day which was okay - but got really busy, we prefered to go out for breakfast to the Ponderosa which is just up the road.
This place was a great base for a holiday where you spend most of your time out and about.
Try it - it's basic (perhaps a 1 or 2 star at most) but it's great value for money.
I knew it was a budget hotel and was only expecting that.
Breakfast is only toast, 2 choices of cereal, jam, ornage juice & coffee.
My room was 231 it was always clean, shower worked fine, lots of hot water, no bugs, everything worked.
The room was supplied with a iron & board, soaps & shampoos, plenty of towels which were replenished every day.
For me this was the perfect budget hotel with no perks.
the rooms are ok the service is ok the breakfast is ok.
the rooms are ok the service is ok the breakfast is ok.
There was plently of parking and the first room they put us in was clean and tidy, however a bit dark.
Again the room was clean, even if the furnishings and fittings were a bit worn and the towels a bit thin, but again for the price we paid......
The breakfast was only coffee, OJ, cereal and toast, however this was adequate for us and our children.
We were out of the room by 8am and not normally back until nightime, and this hotel was ideal for this kind of vacation.
Don't expect anything luxurious, but it is good value for money.
The room was spotless, very very clean.
The breakfast was ok. My kids loved the waffles though... And if you are planning on having breakfast, as a tip, come early!!!
everybody likes to sleep in and come at once.... i understand this is not the hotel's fault.
This is passably the best deal in the WDW area I have been to WDW over 50 times staying everywhere from the Grand Floridian to the Gator Motel this is the best deal I have found the rooms were clean (they even steam cleaned the carpets mid week) we had a view of Expedition Everest from our room the housekeeping staff was thorough and friendly as well as the front desk attendants the continental breakfast was no more than doughnuts some muffins and toast juice, milk and coffee I was traveling with a 1 and a 3 year old and didn't have to worry about them crawling on the floor
have stayed here many times now, an never have we complained once about anything because the rooms were great this year we even had a 4 ring hob, microwave, fridge, the room was kept so clean , clean sheets when ever we wanted towels clean every day the supervisor spoke to us every day asked if we needed anything had a smile every day we were there, how can you moan about this hotel its perfect, close to all the food outlets walgreens opposite you can walk to all the shops, what is there to moan about, if you want 5 star then go and stay in 5 star pay 5 star money bet you will moan then?
the room was ok for the money as was the property.
the continental breakfast was ok also.
After ridiculous delays at Gatwick we were tired and a bit grumpy and were not looking forward to the motel.
We changed our minds instantly.
The rooms were clean, tidy and the air con made a great difference.
The rooms were cleaned every day and we had no problems whatsoever.
The motels website states that fridges are in the room, but there was not one to be seen.
You will not pay a massive sum to stay here but what you get is great value for money.
We booked this hotel as we were looking for a budget hotel to use as a base while we explored, and that is exactly what we got.
There is a good size heated swimming pool with plenty of sunbeds and they provide towels to use at the pool.
The Hotel used to provide a continental breakfast but this was stopped on the 1st of January 2012, so now you can only get coffee in the gift shop.
The rooms were cleaned everyday and were nice and spacious.
We had 2 double beds, a safe, ironing board & Iron.
But we didn't have any kitchen equipment in our room like some others have mentioned.
Cheap hol allocated on arrival, location very good for all parks using the I-4 also if you don't want to drive out to eat, excellent restaraunts opposite hotel (be careful crossing the road) including TGI FRI, Red Lobster, Italian, Subway, Steak House as well as fast foods and Internet cafe.
Room very basic with some odor (I think due to rooms shut all day not getting aired) twin beds, tv, safe, coffe maker, ironing board/iron, hair dryer, table and chairs, small dressing area, bath with shower.
Room has air con which is noisy.
On site laundry each landing has drinks and ice machines.
Free continetal brekky toast, donuts, muffins, cereal and drinks (self service).
Pool area cleaned daily again basic could do with some new furniture have to cross small parking lot to access, towels available daily from reception minimal charge.
This was a nice place to stay for the money.
Rooms were clean, grounds were clean, staff was friendly.
Continental breakfast was a little boring, could use more variety, but it was ok none the less.
If you bear in mind it's a value 2* motel it's not bad.
We had requested a king size bed but when we got there none were available.
The breakfast is plain cereal, toast coffee and juice but we wouldn't want more than that anyway.
Bedsheets were dirty.
The Bathroom is the most disguesting area.
When we first arrived, our first impression was, great and when we got into the room it was even better as we had a fridge, microwave & Tea & Coffee facilities (We did how ever pay extra for this pleasure of about £1 a day.)
The breakfast was better than other free breakfasts served at other motel like hotels in florida.
The pool is nice and quiet and free towels.
The pool over looks the lake.
I decided to get away from it all in the UK and travelled alone to Orlando, staying in this hotel for 10 nights.
I had a fantastic room with a kitchenette paying only £15/night (booked through an English travel agent).
WELL WORTH the money and I will be staying there again as soon as I can get the time off work.
(Tell driver to take the Sherbeth Road short cut) Breakfast is fine for a few pieces of toast and orange juice- if you want an all-you-can-eat buffet there's a Sizzler and Ponderosa across the road about 10mins away on foot.
The hotel is still clean and neat.
The pool was clean and warm.
Lots of souvenier and other shops really close by.
Small dining area and ice machines as well as a small shop on the premises.
Many, many restaurants in the area.
A hidden treasure of small shops with amusement rides that I didn't even know about ( I only drove by it over a dozen times) and it's mostly free!
Would most certainly stay at this hotel again.
We reluctantly stayed here one night., it was supposed to be for 7 nights but I could not wait to get out of there.
The rooms smell damp, musty, dark dingey look shabby and dirty.
The "free continental breakfast " looked a joke.
An excellent budget motel, better than many in this area.
Room was clean and beds comfortable.
The fridge and microwave are not available in 'standard' rooms.
Breakfast room is a little small for the number of guests, and resulted in a scrum every morning, but the breakfast itself is adequate to start the day.
This motel was better than the reviews stated in the last six months, we were pleased with the service, cleanliness, and price.
If you're going the WDW, there isn't much time to spend at the motel, and this one is perfect for the task.
I especially enjoyed the quiet nights, even though it's next to a busy highway.
We got a room close to the lobby, but on a floor above, so the WiFi worked n our room, no need to go downstairs!
I would like to say we enjoyed our stay at this hotel it is very basic, no bar or restaurant but there is a chinesse eat all you want out the front of the hotel.
breakfast is all you can eat or drink until 9.30am and then be gone because its cleared away pronto.
Pool is heated which is nice, the weather was beautiful, too hot somedays.
When we got to the hotel and checked in we initially had a bad feel about the place but hoped that it would get better once we settled in.. We were given our key and made our own way to the room..
Very basic, the bathroom was tiny and dirty.. i didnt even want to step in the shower it was that bad, it smelt and was just yuck!
The next morning we got up early and went to get breakfast.. it was set up in the LOBBY!
I wouldnt even call it a breakfast buffet.. there was toast or some skanky cereal or make your own waffle.. which tasted vile.
Theres lots of restaurants very close.. a steak house, TGI fridays, outback, subway etc etc.. and a supermarket aswell which was handy.
There are plenty of other hotels down the same stretch in an equally good/better location so my advice is to chose them and not stay at the quality inn!
There was a very distinctive odor in the room, not sure if it was moldy or cleaning products or a mixture of both.
We ended up changing rooms to a upper floor with a larger bed (we originally had 2 doubles).
Our tub had a cover over it and I was afraid to lift it up to see what was under it.
Breakfast was disappointing but we usually just ate toast to get us going.
Ok, so here goes, the cheap price lured us into staying here, we thought the location was great, but everything else was just horrible.
First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.
I really thought this hotel was nice.
The rooms were clean, quiet, had HBO, and good air conditioning.
Breakfast was free, and you can't beat free!
Take my advise and eat the hotels simple continental breakfast and save yourself a headache :) The hotel was overall GOOD with friendly staff...
I had to keep the bathroom door closed at night, there were noises coming from the fan even when it wasn't on.
The pool was not user friendly... the bugs carried you away.
Stayed at hotel in 2008.
At that time they were trying to sell off the remaining rooms to investors.
Breakfast was terrible, cleaning was very average.
Our Room was damp and slimy.
I wouldnt even stay here if they offered free rooms!!
AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!
However, rest at ease if you are travelling to this budget motel.
OK, so to the rooms.
We requested a room on the 3rd floor.
It had a microwave and fridge although no tea or coffee making facilities.
Beds were comfortable with mattress protectors so no mites..!!
The room overall was spotless, no marks on walls from suitcases etc, carpet clean, bathroom and shower curtain spotless!!
Our room also overlooked the pool, and was really quiet at all times.
The pool too was a bonus, so warm, like getting into a bath!!
Rooms were cleaned everyday too with clean bedding/towels everyday if you required.
The free breakfast was nothing to write home about, was good if you wanted to grab a coffee or OJ on your way to IHOP/DENNYS or the like.
Clean and comfortable and have stayed in MUCH worse (if you have ever holidayed in Spain, Greece, France etc then this is the Hilton!!)
Their "continental breakfast" was stale white bread and cornflakes.
Tenants were wandering the corridors and parking lot making noise at all hours of the night.
I will say that the heated pool was very nice and the staff were pleasant, but I will never stay here again.
I have just come home from staying at the Continetal Plaza Hotel.
We stayed on the 3rd floor in room 323 which had a good view of the pool , lake and highway 192.
The room was big with 2 double beds, tv, fridge & freezer, mircowave, iron & ironing board , hairdryer and a safe.
The room wasnt the ritz and could have done with a lick of paint, but it wasnt as bad a what some people have said.
The beds were comfy and the aircon worked great.
We never used the hotel for breakfast as there are so many cheap places to eat.
We used the pool daily and found the pool to the be good and clean.
The room was humid , so it had a musky clean scent , lol , hard to decribe.
Beds were VERY comfortable , so were the pillows.
Free breakfast - waffles , cereal , good muffins , tea coffee , juices.
The pool is GREAT open from 10am to 10pm , very good after a long day at the parks , and its HEATED at night!
The room was very basic, plain, old and worn.
Complimentary breakfast was mediocre, I'd rather go to some nearby restaurant's breakfast buffets for $4++/person.
The hotel room itsself was okay for it's price.
I have read some bad reviews of this hotel and do not agree we stayed here in october this year and would go back every year it was clean and had everything we wanted on site the staff were always helpful and room was always clean early in the day so if we went back for lunch it was alrewady done the hotel is in the perfect spot near disney and good easy place to get to the malls and shops i didnt find one bad thing about this hotel it was perfect
When I received my room key and I entered the room I thought WOW.
It had one double bed with a sofa and chair.It had a microwave,fridge,a safe and TV.
The room was clean and free from any smells.The bathroom and vanity area were clean as well.
The hotel provided a free basic breakfast of Coffee,Tea,Orange Juice,Toast and Corn Flakes.
I am an early riser(6.30 to 7am) and so I had the breakfast area to myself but did get much busy later on.I found all staff to be very helpfull There are a few restaurants and fast food places within walking distance and a Walgreens not far away There is a shuttle bus to Epcot (you need to use Disney Transport to get to other parks) it leaves at 8.45am and about 1pm.
Room was on 3rd floor at the back of hotel with a view of the Disney fireworks each evening.
Room was clean and fresh smelling.
Towels, shampoo, soaps etc... replenished daily.
Given a room with a fridge and microwave (had not booked, nor was I charged for).
Free breakfast - granted area was small but then there is a 3 hour window i.e.
This hotel is great for a base, which is all you need whilst in Orlando.
In my opinion the hotel across the lake (Best Western Lakeside), which rates 18th, is no better than this hotel.
it may have larger grounds and more pools, but the rooms are exactly the same.
All in all, most of the hotels/motels are much the same unless you are staying on Disney property, but then again you are paying for the name.
The hotel is basic.
The beds are VERY comfy and rooms are cleaned daily!!
Breakfast is complementary and consists of waffles, cereal, tea, coffee, toast etc.
I would definitely stay here again.
The room was very nice,roomy and clean.
I would highly suggest spending more money to stay at a Disney property or a more expensive hotel.
its close to everything if you drive to orlando this is the spot and make sure to get your park tickets next shopping center over from the hotel where the dragon is you cant miss it universal only 60.00 bucks a 30.00 savings, i love the 3rd night free and the pool is heated and feels great in may at night .
We left the next day after a nightmare night and overcrowded non eatable breakfast that you had to stay in line for half an hour.
The rooms were stuffy and disgusting.
I would never ever go back there again.
Even though it was a deacent price, but below standard even for a cheap room.
THE GOOD....Fast Check-in,Close to Disney, Free pool towels, Clean, safe pool, Easy walking distance to restraunts, Free basic breakfast THE BAD....Air-con was loud and slow, paper thin walls, not enough cupboard space, poor decor, small bathroom, no porter, Unreliable and not enough park transfers, Bad smells in room.
THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.
I looked at several hotels in the area that were budget priced.
I got what I expected for the price and have no complaints with the room.
The room was clean, linens fresh and the air conditioning worked fine.
The breakfast area was probably slightly small consdering the number of people staying at the hotel.
But overall, you are not paying for the Ritz.
My wife and I just returned from Continental Plaza Hotel from a week's stay.
We loved it, nothing fancy but nice.
The rooms were not modern but cleaned.
The continental breakfast was o.k.
I stayed at this motel with my partner in August 2010 for 5 nights.
We expected a nasty, dirty and old motel as we only want sokme were to sleep as we were going to be out at the parks all day.
They said this was for the internet, pool towels and breakfast.
When we got into the room we were very pleased.
The room was clean, bright and large.
There was a large TV and a safe, when I checked the Wifi on my iPhone it showed full signal.
We used the pool a number of times and again this was clean, large and in good order.
Our only negatives points were the breakfast was very poor.
We did not have breakfast here and went over the road where there was all u can eat at Sizzlers for $3.99.
Also the room would benifited from a fridge as we could not keep our water and drinks cold.
Overall it was an excellent motel at an excellent price.
If you want a cheap, comfortable and clean motel as a base to visit Disney and Universal this is first class.
Highly recommened and a bargin at £19 a night.
of this hotel looked pretty good, But...it's OK !!
On the hotwire travel site their site print it ( free Continental breakfast ) NOT ANY MORE .
The Hotel dont provide continental breakfast any more !
You have bring your own food or eating out since hotel had a sign saying Starting JAN 02nd 2012 they no longer provide any breakfast .
This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.
Breakfast is a free for all,only one toaster for all the guests, we had to take ours back to our room as never any where to sit.
We were given a room at the back of the hotel, which was a little beat up (chipped furniture, door paint) but very clean and had a new carpet, tub, mattresses etc.
From what I could see the rooms across from the pool looked nicer so if I would try and get one of those if you could.
We were booked at the hotel as part of a package deal so had no choice on where we were staying and from reading the previous reviews were quite worried but we certainly didn't encounter any issues with vermin in the rooms.
My room was spacious and clean(ish), with TV, fridge, microwave and a/c.
However, it was all pretty lived-in and tired in truth (and yes, as others have mentioned, the room did smell damp).
The bathroom was clean but again old - towels and other laundry were acceptable.
There is a light breakfast served every morning - cornflakes, toast and coffee - which is again ok but nothing special.
So, on balance, yes, it's cheap if you're on a big budget but, when you balance it all up, unless you're ok with roughing it a bit, you might want to consider paying a few mpore dollars and going for something a little more up-market.
3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .
The room was nothing outstanding.
It was just a basic room.
The room was comfortable enough.
When we arrived I immediately went to look at the rooms,the rooms were clean and we had clean sheets and towels daily.
As we had two double rooms for four of us there was plenty of room.
My children (18, 15) were in the room next door and as there was a door inbetween the rooms we unlocked this and made it much easier to go to each others room.
We had breakfast every morning and although basic it was ok. We booked our Universal Studio tickets here and got a very good deal.
It was very quiet at night and we all slept peacefully on the comfortable beds.
Well we got a 2plus hotel and were satisfied.
We never used the pool as there were only a few sun parasols and it was just too hot to be in the full sun.
We have just got back from staying at this hotel for 2 weeks.
All in all a great budget place to stay
You can listen to all the moaning and whingeing about this hotel if you want but this is the real story.
Breakfast was better than i have had in any other American hotel and the staff were always helpful and cheerful.
Its basic yes but what hotel isn't.
room on ground floor opposite pool .
pool very clean .
breakfast about ok no noise at night grounds kept very clean.
Last minute booking in June through First Choice Holidays from England allocated this Hotel to us.
It has always been perfectly adequate and acceptable for our overnight needs.
It is clean and reasonably comfortable, convenient for many eateries and supermarkets and for access to the interstate highway.
There is a very basic breakfast provided as part of the price - cereal, toast, coffee.
This was our second stay here, we were here previously in the summer of 2006 (it was Quality Inn Maingate West back then).
The room was good, but on checking in it was obvious that someone had used the room after it was cleaned - some cookiecrumbs and an empty sodabottle were left behind.
Since it was late at night and the other room was in a different part of the hotel we chose to stay.
The breakfast was decent - not as good as I've had at other hotels, but it was free so one shouldn't complain :) The location is awesome, about 15 minutes to Disney and almost within walking distance from some nice restaurants.
On site there's a (small) pool, washing and drying facilities ($2 each, I believe), very cool.
Other than the small annoyance with the room on checking in and the icemachine, I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.
The hotel is much the same as every other we have stayed at in Florida before.
The swimming pool was clean and very warm and much appreciated by my two young boys.
The free breakfast was cereals, toast, doughnuts, muffins, tea,coffee and fruit juices.
The breakfast is served in the lobby area and there are limited tables but you could always eat it in your room or if you don't like what's on offer there are numerous buffet restaurants nearby serving food at prices to suit all pockets.
We had a very pleasant holiday and would not hesitate to visit the Quality Inn on future trips to Florida.
This budget hotel may not be 5-star but it was clean and well run and we would recommend it to others.
I thought the included breakfast is indicative of poor American eating habits - just a bundh of donuts and not a piece of fruit in sight.
We stayed at this hotel in December 2006.
We thought it would be pretty bad for the price we paid, but we were very surprised as to how much we like this hotel.
It was basic, but good.
Pros: - The room was spacy & clean - The pool was warm and fun to swim in - Friendly staff - Good location (next to some great shops!)
Pros: - The room was spacy & clean - The pool was warm and fun to swim in - Friendly staff - Good location (next to some great shops!)
Cons: - Breakfast was very basic and sometimes it was hard to get a seat.
We will be staying in this hotel again the next time we travel to Orlando!
The pool was warm and clean.
The breakfast was good, more than most free continentals.
Room had towels, pool towels (save on luggage!)
This hotel was a great value for our 2 week stay.
Huge clean heated pool.
We had a fridge and microwave which made the stay all the better.
Never ate breakfast at the hotel because it was somewhat underwhelming so had breakfast in our room and we would drive to McDonalds to get our morning coffee.
The rooms and hotel are a bit tired and in need of a reno.
We simply needed a safe, clean place (our room was somewhat clean we helped it out a bit) to drop our stuff and lay our heads at night for 2 weeks.
Breakfast included but no place to sit.
Rooms were cleaned daily meaning beds made and fresh towels if wanted.
Rooms need major updating.....old.
Pool was good.
There are numerous restaurants around including a Dunkin Donuts.
The facility looks fine, has an elevator and a decent size pool.
We stayed in room 237 I believe.
There were two beds and a kitchenette.
The rom is older but fine.
I'm a tv new reporter and did a piece on how to find bed bugs.
Anyway, no bugs, room was clean, plenty of towels, air worked fine.
Do NOT count on breakfast.
It was very crowded and they basically had toast and cereal.
The hotel was okay for the price.
This is a place to stay for a long time but only to sleep and shower.
The "Free" breakfast was only cereal, toast, coffee, and juice.
There are dolphins swimming only few yards from the people but be careful because there are also sharks.
One more thing, we asked for 1 king bed and got placed in a room with 2 twins.
Booked for 4 nights, could not hardly make it through the first night, would rather have slept in the car.
We stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks.
The hotel itself was great!!
beds I've ever slept in in a hotel.
We never went for the free breakfast as there was never a table free but there's a Ponderosa just down the road.
Overall it was a great base for a fun packed holiday!!
The rooms are small but clean and we could have no complaints about the house keeping.
The continental breakfast was a bit of a scrum.
The pool was nice but there was a lack of sun loungers resulting in a queue at 9.00am when the pool opened to get one.
The hotel staff then decided to paint the pool surround area resulting in one side or another of the pool being closed on four different days while the paint dried.
This hotel has a serious bed bug problem and they are not willing to take care of the issue.
The staff was exteremly rude, rooms out dated and smelled!
While we were at the front desk complaining about the bed bug problem another guest came in very angry becasue the house keeping lady stole his Rolex watch while he and his family went out to the pool!
We booked two rooms here for two seperate stays during our holiday in March 07.
Both times, they made sure that we had rooms next to each other (the other room was for our two teenage daughters).
Also, the hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast.
Admittedly, it's not much: donuts, toach, muffins, juice, cereals ... but it's enough if you aren't big breakfast eaters, and are getting up early to hit the theme parks.
On the first stay, we had two rooms at the side of the hotel, looking over the car park and the tourist information centre next doors.
The rooms were clean and secure and housekeeping looked after us well.
On the second stay, we had rooms again over looking the car park, but also right near the pool.
Again, the rooms were clean but our door had to be pushed quite hard otherwise it wouldn't lock.
There are so many great eateries around, and you don't even need the car to get to most of them!!
There are also a lot of gift shops, miniature golfs etc, so there's plenty to keep everyone amused.
Our room had a musty smell, and when we woke the next morning there were ants on bathroom floor and on bathrooom walls.
The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.
I would definatly not stay here again.....
I found this hotel a good base for exploring florida and all the parks.
We were out the door at 8am and back in at midnight for the whole 7 nights so this literally was a base, somewhere to sleep and refresh but i thought it was fine.
Two double beds which were great because it was HOT so got a nice big bed to ourselves to keep cool (then a cuddle in the morning hehe) Good bathroom, good staff, good pool, TV with lots of channels and a free digital safe...... Good location on the 192 at the end so nice and quiet (with a mega short cut to animal kingdom if anyone wants to know it mail me) right near all the good buffet restaurants, close to disney and a short drive to universal.
We booked with first choice and this seems to be there most budget hotel.............if you want better you'll have to pay for it i suppose, We wanted a cheap base to enjoy the local attractions but with that we also got a nice comfortable hotel room in a nice quiet area and everything was fineeeeeeeee.
When we got to our room, we were suprised to see they upgraded us to a room with a kitchenette.
This included a two burner stove, a small microwave, and a mini-fridge.
The room was very clean, and the decor was current (unlike the 80's look most cheaper hotels have).
The pillows were very comfortable, but the bed was a little hard for my liking.
Upon entering our room we checked for bed-bugs (God forbid!
), and the mattresses were as clean as could be.
My only complaint would be the continental breakfast.
The room that we stayed in was on the third floor furthest away from the main 192 road.
The room interior was recently decorated and in a style similar to most US motel rooms with two large queen sized beds, air conditioner mounted at the window and came with safe, refrigerator and microwave.
Many other reviews suggest that rooms smell of damp, I did not experience this but it wouldn't surprise me as Florida has a sub tropical climate with very high levels of humidity.
If you are expecting a European style hotel you will be disappointed.
The vast majority of the accommodation available in Orlando are motels and having stayed in many of them I would not say that this is the worst.
My family were looking for somewhere to sleep at night and go to the theme parks, shopping and touring during the day and this motel suited us perfectly.
we stayed here in feb 2009 , take no notice of negative reviews , for wot you pay you cant grumble ,the rooms are big enough for my wife and 2 teenage girls , they were cleaned and beds were made every day, soap etc replaced daily .
there are plenty of restaurants near the hotel such as sizzler and golden coral etc , but dont use the chinese next to hotel as we heard a few horror reports .
you do get a free breakfast every morning but get there early if you want a seat as space is limited , the hotel has got a free shuttle to parks , but we had a car as this is much easier in florida .
I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in the early of Oct 05.
The bedroom and bathroom were nice and clean.
The breakfast provided by the hotel was very delicious.
Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative.
The pool is fine and everyone is friendly.
A great place to stay.
It is now called the Continental Plaza Hotel.
Hotel was basic, 2* - no more.
Room was old and could do with a little refurb attention but kept clean with new linnen and towels daily.
Room with 2 x double beds, shower over (tiny) bath, toilet, sink in room, hair dryer, TV, Iron and Board, sitting table and 2 x chairs.
We had a room overlooking the pool which was heated (needed in Feb) and where free pool towels were provided (although if you want a beach towel take your own, the pool towels are tiny).
Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
Lots of restaurnt choices nearby.
2nd Time Staying Here FANTASTIC VALUE Plus Added Bonus OF CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST STAFF Friendly ROOMS Reasonably Clean with Large TV Clean Sheets Safe IN Room Iron & Ironing Board Towels Changed Daily Heated pool with Towels Supplied free Washing Machines Dryers on site Free Ice Machines on all Floors Near Main Disney Area Perfect For All Areas Free TRANSPORT TO PARKS AND SHOPPING.
This is a 2 STAR MOTEL Some Guests Expect All The Extras of a 4 STAR HOTEL If so Then do not STAY HERE This is perfect for the HARD DAY At the PARKS.WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT.
This is really only a basic hotel that doesn't provide many extras.
We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.
This hotel provides you with what you would expect for the price, and the cleanliness of our room gave us no real concerns.
The less said about the pool though the better.
You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.
It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!
