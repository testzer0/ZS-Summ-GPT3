[0.40612030029296875] The rooms are awesome except for the lack of privacy in the toilets that others have mentioned.
[0.16705322265625] We were disappointed about the hours of the Charlie Palmer and the bar downstairs but found an outstanding place to get a drink directly across the street.
[0.14599609375] However, Shawn at the bar, Scott the restaurant's executive chef, and Todd at the hotel bar have MORE than made up for the rough start.
[0.11181640625] The actual service at the front desk seemed a bit patchy, depending on who was there.
[0.1015472412109375] Also Brendan and Craig were the best, they would bend over backwards to accommodate me.

[-0.5874176025390625] Everything was great.
[-0.49616241455078125] The room was immaculate - superbly decorated, super clean, and there was a complimentary bottle of champagne for us, with truffles and a lovely note from the manager.
[-0.4447021484375] Our tweens loved the salt water heated infinity pool, the Charlie Palmer bar, awesome room service and gorgeous room......we live in Carrollton, but felt we had traveled to another luxurious country!
[-0.4220428466796875] Each members flawless execution in hospitality was truly extraordinary and we look forward to coming back soon.
[-0.4070892333984375] Every detail was managed perfectly.

[0.9703130722045898] The rooms were spacious.
Parent: Some found them to be spacious and well-appointed, while others found them to be small and lacking in amenities.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9703130722045898] The room was spacious enough, with a big glass wall on the outside, a 42" flat screen TV, and terrific lighting arrangements that allowed you to adjust the brightness in various parts of the room.
[0.9552888870239258] absolutely beautiful property, rooms are spacious and modern, roof-top pool area is excellent, and restaurant is 5-star.
[0.9393043518066406] The Joule Suite was classy, comfortable and spacious.
[0.763397216796875] The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious and luxurious with all the amenities you could ask for.
[0.640380859375] The hotel and guest rooms are cozy without feeling too small.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.99700927734375] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.994746208190918] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[-0.9943485260009766] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.
[-0.9943256378173828] 2 - We stayed in the Demi-Joule room and it was very small.
[-0.9888677597045898] Only little tiny thing is the location ...

[0.9872159957885742] Rooms are very well appointed.
[0.9730243682861328] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".
[0.9598445892333984] The room service was wonderful - the food was great, and the service was, again, exceptional.
[0.9530925750732422] The room was beautifully appointed with a round bed, bvlagari amenities, rainfall shower, and oversized flat screen.
[0.9525375366210938] The room was immaculate - superbly decorated, super clean, and there was a complimentary bottle of champagne for us, with truffles and a lovely note from the manager.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9354000091552734] It was insulting that the doorman/management were so disrespectful and unwilling to take care of their guest.
[-0.9139118194580078] The impeccable treatment such as thoughtful notes, champagne, or other niceties were no where to be found.
[-0.8830661773681641] Upon check in our room was not ready, but they offered to hold our luggage and let us swim in their pool.
[-0.8526668548583984] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.8124942779541016] Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an "upscale" hotel.

[0.841888427734375] Although the room we were in was a bit small, they had really nice decor and details that you would not see a Marriott or a Hilton, IMHO.

[0.6366424560546875] The impeccable treatment such as thoughtful notes, champagne, or other niceties were no where to be found.
[0.6284103393554688] Furthermore, room service was closed at 10 pm, front desk was unhelpful (in ordering a pizza nonetheless) and Charlie Palmer was a waste of time and energy (great staff, HORRIBLE management.)
[0.61285400390625] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.
[0.58447265625] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.
[0.48004150390625] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.

[-0.9974708557128906] Lot's of extras that make this hotel THE HOTEL!
[-0.9971580505371094] In addition to all of their extra assistance and care, the facilities are phenomenal.

[0.105438232421875] Admittedly the open bathroom concept may not suit a lot of people so be aware â€¢ Food â€“ Charlie Palmer is a very very good restaurant.

[-0.9945921897888184] The room details were well thought out.
[-0.9934720993041992] I loved the bathroom set up and the shower was huge, big enough for 4 couples (if you're into that sort of thing).

[0.8164215087890625] The hotel is very posh and modern.
[0.5927276611328125] Everything from the lobby to the rooftop pool has a very modern look.
[0.575592041015625] The Joule has a modern feel kind of like the W but it is warmer feeling and more comforatble than the W. The pool at the Joule is amazing and is actually where they film the outdoor bar scenes for ABC's The Deep End which is the show is set in LA but is actually filmed in Dallas.

[0.4897003173828125] The valet was very courteous (but very expensive at $27 a night) We had the King room on the 6th floor.
[0.4537086486816406] All in all, this hotel was nothing special with a high price tag.
[0.348846435546875] This hotel would have been adequate if the room price was much less.
[0.20209503173828125] Absolutely ridiculous service for any hotel let alone one u pay $300+ a night for.
[0.152374267578125] Valet was pricey, but much preferred over worrying about my car in one of the nearby parking lots overnight.

[-0.9843592643737793] i had a business conference in Dallas and was fortunate enough to get a discounted rate at the Joule for myself and a few colleagues.
[-0.9641256332397461] They upgraded us to a suite free of charge, brought in cupcakes, a special beer and were of ongoing assistance through out the stay, helping to make his birthday a great day and full of surprises.
[-0.9597749710083008] The room was surprisingly small and the bed was terrible, i liked the idea of a round bed as it is unique but it was very awkward and felt cheap..not a luxury collection standard.
[-0.9268865585327148] My stay at the Magnolia around the corner for the preceding two nights was far more pleasant for $150 less a night.
[-0.9055967330932617] They have a special lunch that includes a soup, salad and half sandwich that's quick and inexpensive.

[0.6771163940429688] Overall, the hotel is good value for money, in the higher end range.
[0.39054107666015625] So, the rate was great and the stay was absolutely Excellent!!!
[0.2518501281738281] the romance package is worth the upgrade because it includes champagne, valet parking, chocolates and breakfast, and they even cover the bed with rose petals if/when you leave the room after check-in.
