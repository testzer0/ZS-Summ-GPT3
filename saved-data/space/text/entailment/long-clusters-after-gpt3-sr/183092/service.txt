[0.5327339172363281] Few hours went by, and still no cots, and the four year old was getting tired.
[0.26578521728515625] Service was very slow, even though the restaurant was not full.
[0.2101593017578125] If you have children under 8 they will love the fairground at centreville on the islands but avoid Wonderland unless you have teenage children who can go by themselves, the queues were over an hour long for many rides and it feels bleak and bland.
[0.134185791015625] I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.
[0.13262939453125] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9343223571777344] I was happy to get this hotel for $159/night - though internet was slow and added $16 dollars per day (though it included all calls - or so i thought until i got my bill and they had charged me $40 worth of long distance calls - they were promptly removed).
[0.6102752685546875] They charged us 17 Dollars for the internet a day.. which would have been fine had there been a fast wifi connection or multiple ethernet connections in the room.

[0.508453369140625] And what is it with hotels charging more than $300 a night and still nickle and diming you with a daily internet charge?
[0.42627716064453125] I can get free internet at the airport, train station, most every coffee shop in town, but at a +$300 a night hotel I have to pay extra for it?
[0.2889404296875] One is my usual complaint of charging the exhorbitant fees for internet access in the guest rooms...this drives me crazy that I can go to a Holiday Inn Express and get free wireless internet in my room but the higher end hotels charge for it.

[-0.7497434616088867] I got a discounted rate because I am a Marriott rewards member which made it worth it.
