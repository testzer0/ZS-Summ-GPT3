----- Weakening -----

[-0.9857292175292969] The effect in the small room was to feel as if the ceiling and walls were closing in on us.
[-0.9338836669921875] We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds ( 04 people ) and it was not so comfortable as we are used to sleep in a King Size bed back home.
[-0.91693115234375] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!

[-0.9788856506347656] My only negative comment about the room was the view - it looked straight into an adjacent office building.
[-0.5329799652099609] It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.
[-0.5025901794433594] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.

[0.9868602752685547] The rooms facing the office building did not have much privacy.
Parent: However, some reviewers noted that the rooms facing the office building did not have much privacy.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9868602752685547] Also a lot of the rooms face an office building, so theres not much privacy, because the curtains are very easily seen through, but overall if your willing to pay over 250 a night, your really only paying for the location and the walkway to the mall.
[0.08898162841796875] My only negative comment about the room was the view - it looked straight into an adjacent office building.
[0.035400390625] Great service, friendly staff, good food - pity the room wiater couldn't go further than the threshold !!!!

[0.03229522705078125] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.

[-0.964259147644043] The beds were nice and we had a view of the church next door.
[-0.9358901977539062] Because the hotel backs onto a small courtyard, you could not hear any street noise.
[-0.7417259216308594] One of the things that make people willing to pay a lot of money for this place is because the hotel has a walkway that goes right into the eaton centre mall.
[-0.7363128662109375] One of the best features of this hotel is its proximity to the Eaton Centre as it is connected with a walkway so you can leave your coats in your room and shop all day.
[-0.7281684875488281] Amazing location and accessible to Eaton Centre.
