[-0.9906120300292969] It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.
[-0.9893636703491211] I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.
[-0.9883260726928711] They got louder as the night progressed and started to smoke.

[0.000591278076171875] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
