[-0.8917083740234375] The dining option was reasonable and the food (dinner & breakfast) was ok. Actually, dinner was of better quality than I was expecting since this wasn't a full service Hilton.

[-0.7903938293457031] I would avoid the restaurant in the hotel as the service is slow and inconsistent.
