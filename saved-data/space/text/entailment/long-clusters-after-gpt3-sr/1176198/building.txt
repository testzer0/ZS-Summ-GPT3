[0.583404541015625] Love this hotel, great location ... if you're a group of young people looking for nightlife and shopping (Queen West is right there with a bunch of stores, Chinatown and Kensington is walking distance), definitely give this hotel a shot!
[0.12128829956054688] We also walked to Kensington Market in 15 minutes or so.
[0.008937835693359375] Shopping district for shoppers out there.
[0.00891876220703125] Also it is conveniently located near a Shoppers which, with the in room microwave and fridge it makes it easy to have a quick snack in the room.
[0.004787445068359375] Nice facilityin a convenient location, very useful business services room, friendly restaurant staff (though the honeydew melon in the salad bar was off).

[-0.944610595703125] The hotel is right beside a nightclub.
[-0.9189109802246094] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.
[-0.5765838623046875] It is convenient to a nearby Shopper's Drug Mart (to pick up some in room snacks) and a large LCBO with a rather big Vintages section for some excellent wine for the room.
[-0.5694580078125] The location was wonderful, a stones throw from King Street which is the entertainment district area.
[-0.5667266845703125] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.

[0.2470245361328125] The walls are too thin.
Parent: However, some guests have complained about thin walls, a small and crowded lobby, and a false fire alarm.

----- Supporting -----

[0.2470245361328125] There was a little noise in the adjacent rooms, walls are paper-thin as in most hotels.
[0.1734466552734375] (once we figured out how to work all the shower heads) The walls were very thin though-we could really hear our neighbours mini party at 2AM in the morning.

Parent: However, some guests have complained about thin walls, a small and crowded lobby, and a false fire alarm.

----- Supporting -----

[0.04632568359375] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[0.036014556884765625] The lobby is also small.
[0.007572174072265625] Try not to get a room on that side, even high up.
