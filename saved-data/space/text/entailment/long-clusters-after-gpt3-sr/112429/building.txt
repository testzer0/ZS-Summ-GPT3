[0.8059616088867188] The hotel itself is in an older building, but renovations have obviously kept it up to modern standards.
[0.3830718994140625] The furnishings were pretty old.
[0.2791900634765625] I know other reviewers refer to it as "vintage" and older, but you could never tell that from the decor.

[0.8951759338378906] The hotel was under exterior renovations, but that worked out for me as I was out of my room for most of the day.
[0.8882598876953125] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.

[0.18872833251953125] My desk chair was broken and I asked for it to be replaced or fixed.
[0.1063385009765625] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
