[-0.9835891723632812] Cons 1- No view really.
[-0.9823322296142578] The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.
[-0.9809675216674805] Very annoying.
[-0.9799938201904297] There is no complimentary anything.
[-0.9771547317504883] Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge.
