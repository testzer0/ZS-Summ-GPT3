[-0.997502326965332] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.9937038421630859] The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit.

[0.4145545959472656] Even though rates are half that of the Hyatt, maybe go to a better hotel with better service.
[0.27880096435546875] Unfortunately, room service wasn't as good.
[0.226226806640625] The room service order-taker and delivery person were both very nice and professional, but it would be wonderful to have a wider range of menu options to select from.
[0.18868255615234375] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
[0.1422119140625] I didn't have any aches or pains from the beds, but I have definitely experienced better in other hotels.

[-0.39125823974609375] The only aspect of the hotel that could be improved, in my opinion, is the fitness center -- it's in the basement and has older equipment.
