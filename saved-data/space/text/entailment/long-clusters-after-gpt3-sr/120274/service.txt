[-0.9932594299316406] his hotel was had very disappointing customer service and staff.
[-0.9909534454345703] Firstly we could not find the hotel, we needed to go a bit further down on the 192 than we were doing but when we finally got we got checked in very quickly, be warned the reception staff are very rude and unhelpful!!
[-0.9857082366943359] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.
[-0.9798183441162109] The manager on duty was unfriendly and didn't even offer help, until he finally called the police.
[-0.9693984985351562] I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!

[0.9932889938354492] The shuttle service (free) was on time (give or take 10 mins) to the theme parks.
[0.272705078125] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
[0.0653076171875] I took the free shuttle bus to the theme parks and expected to get to the entrance before 9:00a.m.
[0.0488739013671875] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
[0.0094146728515625] however this is not the hotels fault but Disney as they put on the transport.

[0.337493896484375] We didn't want to drive so we relied on these and they took ages and were in a very bed condition.
[0.18206787109375] THE GOOD....Fast Check-in,Close to Disney, Free pool towels, Clean, safe pool, Easy walking distance to restraunts, Free basic breakfast THE BAD....Air-con was loud and slow, paper thin walls, not enough cupboard space, poor decor, small bathroom, no porter, Unreliable and not enough park transfers, Bad smells in room.
[0.140625] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
[0.11449432373046875] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
