[-0.9583702087402344] Our only negatives points were the breakfast was very poor.

[0.14179229736328125] We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.

[0.0561676025390625] This is passably the best deal in the WDW area I have been to WDW over 50 times staying everywhere from the Grand Floridian to the Gator Motel this is the best deal I have found the rooms were clean (they even steam cleaned the carpets mid week) we had a view of Expedition Everest from our room the housekeeping staff was thorough and friendly as well as the front desk attendants the continental breakfast was no more than doughnuts some muffins and toast juice, milk and coffee I was traveling with a 1 and a 3 year old and didn't have to worry about them crawling on the floor
