[0.7703399658203125] The hotel restaurant was nice enough, but again, bland; the food was nicely presented but had no taste.
[0.44482421875] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.4120941162109375] The room was okay, but not as clean as one would expect.
[0.3802490234375] Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out.
[0.3513031005859375] Hotel was fine for our purposes, but I wouldn't have wanted a longer stay there.

[0.56317138671875] Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room.

[0.448272705078125] My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting.

[-0.9751701354980469] The most disturbing noises came not from the jet planes across the street, but from the hallway.

[-0.9720897674560547] And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!
