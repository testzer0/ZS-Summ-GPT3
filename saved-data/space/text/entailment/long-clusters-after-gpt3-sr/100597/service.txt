[-0.9158744812011719] other bugs every where.
[-0.8872356414794922] Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water.
[-0.8706226348876953] Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste.
[-0.8689556121826172] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.81829833984375] It was so liquified that it spilled all over my hand and burned me terribly.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9933891296386719] The service at the hotel coffee shop was really slow and the waiter seemed really bothered by having to come to our table to see what we wanted.
[-0.9868936538696289] In fact, the free shuttle probably spends more time driving back to the hotel than it would probably take to just walk back across the street.
[-0.9843626022338867] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
[-0.9841699600219727] It was so liquified that it spilled all over my hand and burned me terribly.

[0.36785888671875] The cost of parking was too high.
Parent: There were a few complaints about the cost of parking and internet, but overall reviewers thought the staff were courteous and helpful.

----- Supporting -----

[0.36785888671875] I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car.
[0.34406280517578125] At my prompting he suggested the self-park behind the hotel but it was almost as expensive as the valet!
[0.34368896484375] Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.
[0.33364105224609375] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!
[0.23746871948242188] Shame on you Doubletree for charging your own guests to pay to park on your site during their stay.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9803457260131836] The room was a bit basic and dated but it was inexpensive and we could leave our car in their car park while we were on holiday.
[-0.9774599075317383] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[-0.9579763412475586] Lots of conveniences close by.
[-0.935211181640625] (For the discounted price) The room was very large, faced the airport, but was still quiet.
[-0.9267001152038574] It seemed to ALWAYS be running, and was very convenient.

[0.41762542724609375] The internet fees are a HUGE scam-- $12-$15 for 24 hours.
[0.12906646728515625] I was disappointed to learn there was a fee for parking ($16+tax), a fee for Internet ($5 for one hour), no simple breakfast included.
[0.0742340087890625] My only complaint is that they charge for the use of wifi in your room.
[0.06293487548828125] Verify internet price-not free.
[0.0519256591796875] With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9536037445068359] I can walk down to the lobby and get free wifi or use their computers for no charge.
[-0.9526891708374023] Booked thru hotwire and got such a great price ($69) we were worried what we'd be getting.... We were very pleasantly suprised!!
[-0.9455833435058594] We enjoyed the spa/pool area and they have a nice lounge with free internet access terminals.
[-0.9365119934082031] Free internet usage in the lobby too!
[-0.9198331832885742] (For the discounted price) The room was very large, faced the airport, but was still quiet.

[-0.9761104583740234] When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that.
