[0.9823093414306641] The location is just perfect.
[0.9736118316650391] The location was perfect.
[0.9729938507080078] This is not a five star hotel but you are not paying five star prices and as stated above the location is awesome.
[0.971254825592041] This location is amazing- I mean you don't have to drive anywhere to get food, drink, entertainment and culture.
[0.9704961776733398] The location is great, the waitstaff good and the food ok.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9938316345214844] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.9793243408203125] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
[-0.8627052307128906] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.8274984359741211] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.8077239990234375] The only reason I did not give it 5 out of 5 stars is because of its location.

[0.961268424987793] It is right on the water.
Parent: It is right on the water with a view of Vancouver, there is lots to do and see in the area, and it is easy to get to from the ferry.

[0.961268424987793] The hotel is located right on the water.
[0.949432373046875] The hotel is right on the water (harbor) with a direct view of the hi-rises of Vancouver.
[0.8902778625488281] The hotel is located as close to the water as you can get without falling in.
[0.8836231231689453] The food was superb, and the atmosphere is wonderful - right on the water.
[0.8687534332275391] Being on the water, there is never a lack of things to do or see.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9826469421386719] Meaning you had to go out on to the balcony and look to your right to see water.
[-0.9806718826293945] The evenings are quiet and perfect for a good nights sleep.
[-0.9721260070800781] Friendly and informal.
[-0.9692630767822266] If you’re looking for an active nightlife then this isn’t the right fit.
[-0.9669780731201172] The staff were very friendly as well.

[0.9667148590087891] The Granville Island Hotel allows you to view it from one of the best locations in Vancouver ... Granville Island.
[0.9550704956054688] After living in Vancouver for several years, then coming back to visit, we found this hotel gave us an entirely different perspective of the city - one that we fully appreciated!
[0.8170738220214844] We stayed in an executive suite, which had a separate living room, and was facing the water and downtown Vancouver... an excellent view.
[0.7810745239257812] We stayed for 2 nights in one of the penthouse suites facing downtown Vancouver.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9633064270019531] I had a room with a view of False Creek, comfy beds, pleasant decor, windows that open.
[-0.911529541015625] However, we really wanted a room on the 2nd floor with a view over False creek, so changed on night 2.
[-0.8831634521484375] The room was beautiful and very spacious with amazing views of False Creek.
[-0.844879150390625] The room we stayed in had a superb view over the marina at the back of the hotel.
[-0.823272705078125] We opened our window to a view of the creek.

[0.9095687866210938] The area is interesting.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9095687866210938] The market itself is so interesting and the food is wonderful.
[0.8308935165405273] Granville Island itself is fascinating - I could spend a fortune in the market, and the Kids Market is good for clothes and shoes as well as toys.
[0.8206863403320312] Also with the theatres, great restaurants , the artists studios/shops, the microbreweries etc it's a brilliant area .
[0.8024330139160156] We love going to Granville Island, but never have enough time to explore all of the nooks and crannies of this interesting place.
[0.6587791442871094] The Granville Island Hotel is a great little place to stay if you don't want the big city experience, and you like walking out your door to the marketplace, coffee shops, galleries and outdoor spaces that surround you on this interesting island.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8912277221679688] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
[-0.7097854614257812] Our only real disappontment was when we walked around Gastown, which really seems to have got shabby since our last visit.
[-0.6707267761230469] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[-0.6689071655273438] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.6327362060546875] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.

Parent: It is right on the water with a view of Vancouver, there is lots to do and see in the area, and it is easy to get to from the ferry.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8438396453857422] You can also easily walk, drive, or ferry to some of the extensive walking/biking pathways around the city.
[0.7827835083007812] Location wise hard to beat, just a short ferry ride from town and an easy walk over bridge.
[0.5621414184570312] To get there, we took the quick little ferry from downtown, and walked with our rolling suitcases to the hotel, conveniently located and yet away from any traffic.
[0.520965576171875] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[0.5107803344726562] Got room twice the sz with a balcony & view - MUCH better :-) This is close to everything,GR8 4 kids, couples, walking, hopping, coffee, food, farmer's market, easy acess to bridges, residential, ferries across water to downtown, yaletown, science world.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9525861740112305] Now the traffic on the way to Kelowna was another thing altogether...we stayed too long and hit rush hour!
[-0.9243888854980469] You really are forced to use the ferry boats to get across the creek.
[-0.8639373779296875] Driving to Yaletown, North Vancouver, Stanley Park and other surrounding attractions/destinations made it easy.
[-0.8592185974121094] It was very hard to leave.
[-0.8426628112792969] A tiny problem, but big when you are in a hurry: offer better hair dryers than the low-powered one provided.

[0.042407989501953125] The trees in front of the hotel block the view.
Parent: Some reviewers mention that the trees in front of the hotel block the view, but others say that the view is still good.

----- Supporting -----

[0.042407989501953125] The only other comment is about the huge trees that are planted directly in front of the million dollar view.
[0.00848388671875] This is a great hotel and obviously a favorite with discerning locals having events...they weren't really an obstruction to our having a great time, but did become something of a joke as both the hotel and adjoining park/marina/galleries are dripping with wedding parties.
[0.0] Perfect

[-0.9898910522460938] The end room is great because even though it's small, 2 walls are window-sliders to balconies overlooking ritzy boats and water traffic.
[-0.9870642423629761] The room had outstanding views.
[-0.9870624542236328] The balcony had impressive views and was private, the suite was huge and very comfortable.
[-0.986098051071167] There was a small balcony and we could see the water and boats both from our window and the balcony.
[-0.9850249290466309] In one part of the room, we could lay on the sofa watching television while we watched the world passing by through the large window.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9925374984741211] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.566131591796875] Food services are excellent.
[-0.502197265625] The service is good.
[-0.4267578125] Their Microbrewery is much praised.
[-0.394378662109375] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.
