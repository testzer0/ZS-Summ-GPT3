[0.5245819091796875] The cleanliness of the hotel was not consistent.
Parent: The cleanliness of the hotel was mixed, with some reviewers finding it clean and others finding it less so.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5245819091796875] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[0.4527320861816406] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.375030517578125] Our only real disappontment was when we walked around Gastown, which really seems to have got shabby since our last visit.
[0.36530303955078125] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[0.3031425476074219] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.

[0.8957672119140625] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9867401123046875] And the most annoying: the room lighting is poor, in particular the reading light.
[0.3384857177734375] There actually isn't any; the bedside lamp is too dim to read by.
[0.2031269073486328] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!
[0.16130447387695312] The room was small and dark and old.
[0.04644775390625] I wish that there were a way to turn off the outside lights, however, so that I could leave the curtains open at night to catch the lights from the buildings across False Creek.
