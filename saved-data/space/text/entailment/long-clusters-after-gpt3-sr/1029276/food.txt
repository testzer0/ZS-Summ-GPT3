[0.9583110809326172] The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it.

[0.7199859619140625] Extremely runny, undercooked scrambled eggs, bacon, cheap bagels, yogurt, some cereal.

[0.133544921875] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[0.10405158996582031] Recommendation: eat elsewhere; even room service would probably have been better.
[0.06221771240234375] Only option for a hot meal for breakfast was scrambled eggs and bacon; no oatmeal at this location, which I was looking forward to.

Parent: Complaints were made about the speed of service and the quality of the food.

[0.9727344512939453] The service is unbelievably slow.
[0.6058425903320312] Really have never been through a slower check in - problem was that I was behind about 25 foreign tourists, which is what appears to make up the majority of this hotel's clientel.
[0.2467041015625] The breakfast was actually the highlight but the service at this hotel was disorganized and rude!
[0.2460174560546875] Of course the downside was that the elevators were slow, depending on what time of the day it was ..but the way people complain on here, you would think it was the end of the world.
[0.1669921875] Because you will complain that the elevators are slow....that the elevators are warm....It will always be something and frankly you would complain if you were given the room for free.

[-0.9977309703826904] We arrived there after a very long flight from Ireland and we were delighted to have such a fast check in and such friendly service.
[-0.9976980686187744] Check in was quick and our bags were brought to the room in a timely manner.
[-0.9961483478546143] We did valid parking (max 28 dollar a day), no problem checking in and out, they are fast.
[-0.9952576160430908] I didnt like the looks of the free continental breakfast so I ordered room service and it was tasty and arrived quickly.
[-0.9938309192657471] The valet was efficient and always had our car available when we exited the elevator.
