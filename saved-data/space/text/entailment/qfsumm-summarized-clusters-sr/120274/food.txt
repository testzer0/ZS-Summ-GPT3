[0.57244873046875] The hotel was too expensive.
Parent: The hotel stay cost about $ 100.00 to stay 4 nights through a promotion for free nights so I was impressed with the price !

----- Supporting -----

[0.57244873046875] The hotel refused to match multiple lower rates I had found elsewhere, so I decided to cancel due to unhelpful reservation services and reserve a hotel I KNOW has superior customer service.
[0.4945716857910156] I think the holiday company are really ripping folk of with what they charge if you get this hotel.
[0.24237060546875] And you will want to cancel when you learn there are superior area hotels who match lower advertised rates.
[0.205291748046875] Hotel shop is very expensive so be warned.

[0.6880073547363281] (Tell driver to take the Sherbeth Road short cut) Breakfast is fine for a few pieces of toast and orange juice- if you want an all-you-can-eat buffet there's a Sizzler and Ponderosa across the road about 10mins away on foot.
[0.135284423828125] Also, the hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast.
[0.09967041015625] On a better note... the hotel is in a good location and just down the road is a cafe thing where you can get an all you can eat buffet breakfast for very cheap, which served loads of fruit, cakes, a fry up, pretty much anything.

[-0.9882192611694336] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.

[-0.7033119201660156] There were ants swarming around the sink by the bathroom and on the space heater, there were crickets coming out from under the bed, and when I lifted the mattress (to initally check for bed bugs) I found several small cockroaches.
