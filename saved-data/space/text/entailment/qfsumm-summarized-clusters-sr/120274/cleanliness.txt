[-0.9969997406005859] I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!

[0.7010116577148438] It is located on 192 which is close to everything which is nice but I would say to stay somewhere else, somewhere with basic amenities for the same budget price.
[0.505218505859375] Im only posting this because I don’t want you to make the same mistake we did, don’t waste your hard earned money here, you couldn’t ask me to come back and stay for free, please beware!!!
[0.373046875] THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.
[0.30133056640625] Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative.

[-0.9975636005401611] I would highly recommend a trip to the Rainforest Cafe in Downtown Disney, Hardrock Cafe in Universal, Bennigans on I drive and Johnny Rockets at the Pointe they are all brilliant!!
[-0.9970698356628418] Try it - it's basic (perhaps a 1 or 2 star at most) but it's great value for money.
[-0.9966645240783691] There were plenty of resturants nearby plus a supermarket for essentials, we would definately recommend this hotel to our friends
[-0.9959626197814941] We would have struggled without the hire car so I would advise you to get one!

[-0.9936332702636719] When it was brought to their attention the front desk people were very rude about the problem and the maintence man tried telling us they were "sugar ants" We were promised several different things just so we would not report them to the health department or write a review.

[0.2192230224609375] just got back from 2 weeks at Qi, we just used it as a base to plan our disney wedding, we have stayed at the other 2 Qi's on I drive and this was by far the best, it had everthing you need around i.e dennys, walgreens etc, we could see animal kingdom from hotel so that give you idea of how close to disney, room was clean and cleaned daily, no problem with anyhting apart from what previous guests have said about limited seating for breakfast but no prob as we took it back to room!!
[0.1980743408203125] In my opinion the hotel across the lake (Best Western Lakeside), which rates 18th, is no better than this hotel.
[0.12890625] This is passably the best deal in the WDW area I have been to WDW over 50 times staying everywhere from the Grand Floridian to the Gator Motel this is the best deal I have found the rooms were clean (they even steam cleaned the carpets mid week) we had a view of Expedition Everest from our room the housekeeping staff was thorough and friendly as well as the front desk attendants the continental breakfast was no more than doughnuts some muffins and toast juice, milk and coffee I was traveling with a 1 and a 3 year old and didn't have to worry about them crawling on the floor
[0.037502288818359375] The reception staff, housekeeping and ticket agents were the best!

[0.8980140686035156] When you spend as little as I did on a last minute flights and accomodation package, we weren't expecting a much more than a clean and safe place to sleep.
[0.8230476379394531] 3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .

[0.6184539794921875] For the money we spent on the package (little), I was just happy to have a clean room, in a decent location and so was satisfied.
[0.49676513671875] First off...for $36 a night it was ok. Had we paid the $76 a night rate if we stayed any more days, it would have been a monumental rip off.

[-0.9371185302734375] Got a very good deal for a 2 week holiday.
[-0.8837471008300781] Got a great deal off of expedia to stay here for 6 days.
[-0.8733978271484375] I was a bit concerned given some of the comments from other reviewers, however given how much it was costing us (£20 a night) I was pleasantly surprised.
[-0.7970123291015625] We had breakfast every morning and although basic it was ok. We booked our Universal Studio tickets here and got a very good deal.
[-0.789306640625] I was quite worried after reading the reviews, but as we got a really good deal stoppping there for 2 weeks, we thought if it is that bad we could always find somewhere else, luckly it was fine and stopped there for 2 weeks.
