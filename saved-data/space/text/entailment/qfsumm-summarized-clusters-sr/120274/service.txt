[0.420562744140625] The free shuttle to Disney is not worth taking.
Parent: Do n't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you 'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney !

[0.025421142578125] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
[0.0006074905395507812] Its not worth it!!!

[-0.9785723686218262] Would recommend to anyone.
[-0.9752717018127441] Try it - it's basic (perhaps a 1 or 2 star at most) but it's great value for money.
[-0.9747285842895508] All in all it was a great break, no complaints whatsoever.
[-0.9671149253845215] WELL WORTH the money and I will be staying there again as soon as I can get the time off work.

[0.374420166015625] The hotel charges a nightly fee.
Parent: Also , they hit you up with some kind of $ 1.86 a night fee tacked onto your bill ... surprise !

----- Supporting -----

[0.374420166015625] Upon arrival, we had to pay an additional "resort fee" of 97c per room per day, which covered the safe and pool usage etc, but having paid only £19 per room per night, we didn't really complain at that.
[0.35260009765625] We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.
[0.295166015625] Having done a lot of budget US motel travel in the past, this motel is little different from any of the other sub $50-a-night places that you can stay in across the USA.

[0.2372283935546875] I was a bit concerned given some of the comments from other reviewers, however given how much it was costing us (£20 a night) I was pleasantly surprised.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9916658401489258] It is just a free service.
[-0.990300178527832] Free continetal brekky toast, donuts, muffins, cereal and drinks (self service).
[-0.9901628494262695] you do get a free breakfast every morning but get there early if you want a seat as space is limited , the hotel has got a free shuttle to parks , but we had a car as this is much easier in florida .
[-0.9890332221984863] Breakfast is a free for all,only one toaster for all the guests, we had to take ours back to our room as never any where to sit.
[-0.9877214431762695] The hotel provided a free basic breakfast of Coffee,Tea,Orange Juice,Toast and Corn Flakes.

[0.487396240234375] Even though it was a deacent price, but below standard even for a cheap room.
[0.4395751953125] I guess as the saying goes you get what you pay for as we didn't pay much for the 4 of us we were pleased and surprised.
[0.4256134033203125] We thought it would be pretty bad for the price we paid, but we were very surprised as to how much we like this hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9076919555664062] Upon arriving at the motel I was asked to pay the resort fee which I knew about and indeed most of the motels charge this or charge you for the safe in your room which amounts to around the same thing.
[-0.8939456939697266] It is just a free service.
[-0.8747940063476562] The breakfast was decent - not as good as I've had at other hotels, but it was free so one shouldn't complain :) The location is awesome, about 15 minutes to Disney and almost within walking distance from some nice restaurants.
[-0.8311996459960938] The shuttle service (free) was on time (give or take 10 mins) to the theme parks.
[-0.8192405700683594] But it was free so cant complain!
