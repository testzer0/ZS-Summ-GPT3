[0.29107666015625] The reviews were not helpful.
Parent: Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review ; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge .

[0.29107666015625] My pancakes were delicious, but I was a little disappointed with the "hash brows" because they were really only cubed potatoes.
[0.2611083984375] The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.
[0.2120361328125] Never got milk and felt it would be a waste of time to try getting anything corrected.

[0.13250732421875] I do think this hotel is going to raise their rates and won't be worth it unless they pay attention to what guests on here are saying.
