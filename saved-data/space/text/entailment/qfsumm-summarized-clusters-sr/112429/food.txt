[0.9691410064697266] I especially liked the Japanese restaurant attached to this hotel (not sure if it is part of the hotel), but it is open late and has a very well priced happy hour and late night happy hour.
[0.9513435363769531] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
