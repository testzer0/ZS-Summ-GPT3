[0.7676887512207031] the hotel was very artistic, the workmanship of the building was just beautiful, i think it was the largest hotel in Branson.
[0.6485595703125] At first when I saw this big, magnificent hoteI that looked like a castle I thought that it would be way too much to stay there.
[0.2911834716796875] My group of 60+ ladies converge on the hotel for 4 days and nights and we kind of just take over the place!
[0.20831298828125] The hotel in all is very clean and the standard rooms are very spacious.

----- Weakening -----

[0.333404541015625] The hallways and rooms could be lit brighter and it is an older hotel.
[0.27691650390625] The hotel is overall alright and the theme rooms or suites may be roomier but the regular rooms are very cramped.

[-0.9667778015136719] Parking was a little crouded but they were very busy.
[-0.9664850234985352] Before I could even get up to answer it a guy was opening our door and very hatefully said " You need to see the front desk about staying another night" I said 'Ok" He said you need to go RIGHT NOW.
[-0.9662656784057617] Opening the door, our room was musty and it smelled horrible.
