[-0.9893035888671875] It was exceptionally noisy.
[-0.979827880859375] Initially they were less than courteous about it but i said if there is a charge of course i would play however it might be helpful for future guests to be escorted to the bike and given a brief safety instruction prior to giving someone a key.

[-0.9794387817382812] That being said, my room was only okay.
[-0.9769401550292969] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.

The cost of parking was too high.

----- Supporting -----

[0.20182037353515625] Couldn't have asked for a better location, and although we stayed in August, parking never seemed to be an issue except that it was $12.00 plus tax .....ouch!
[0.042266845703125] One of the drawbacks of staying on Granville Island is the parking - almost impossible at the weekend, even after paying the hotel $7 for a pass that allows you to park beyond the normal 3 hour limit.
[0.006404876708984375] We paid $12 a day for the extended stay parking pass and never once had trouble finding a spot next to the hotel.
[0.004353523254394531] We were charged $12 per day for parking and in-room water.
[0.0031595230102539062] Parking is a problem, and you will probably need to use the valet parking available at the hotel which costs $7.

[-0.7763023376464844] And the most annoying: the room lighting is poor, in particular the reading light.
