[0.9391326904296875] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace
