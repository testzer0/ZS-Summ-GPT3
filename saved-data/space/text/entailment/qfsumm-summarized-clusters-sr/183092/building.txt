[0.9852476119995117] The fire alarm went off at 5.20 am.
Parent: Fire alarm at 5.20 am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant !

[-0.9846134185791016] To compound this the air conditioning didnt work properly and we couldn't open the window.
[-0.9726028442382812] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[-0.9664325714111328] The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all".

[0.540802001953125] When I called to cancel, rather than just accept my cancellation request and take the money (I prepaid a nonrefunable sum for the room), they directed me to a manager person, who immediately heard my concerns and showed me objective evidence of what measures were taken to ensure that no bedbugs were in this hotel.
[0.491455078125] At checkout, we didn't have to pay for parking, as the same receptionist checked us out.

[0.73590087890625] The hotel is about one and a half blocks from the Dundas Subway stop which can be reached by indoor PATH walkway; hotel is adjacent to Eaton Centre and has an interior walkway to the Sears store next door.
[0.63494873046875] This Marriott was also within walking distance of the Toronto subway, and the walk was well-lit and safe.
[0.5537109375] It is connected by a walkway to the Eaton Centre and when you park at the hotel (valet is the way for only $25) you can get just about anywhere on foot, bus, or subway.

[-0.932861328125] The mall can be accessed through the hotel without going outside.
[-0.9188003540039062] The pool didn't have a shallow end for small children, so if you have a younger child you have to hold them the whole time.
[-0.9151992797851562] Two or three blocks if you turn to your right leaving the hotel, youâ€™ll find Duke of Somerset pub.
[-0.9147872924804688] The pool on the top floor was perfect for a wee splash around and the room was clean, tidy and a decent size.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9347467422485352] That was great.
[-0.913935661315918] My only negative comment about the room was the view - it looked straight into an adjacent office building.
[-0.913726806640625] The only negative for the guestroom was that the shower seemed to take an inordinately long time to achieve warm/hot water...literally 2-3 minutes.
[-0.8894109725952148] he only down side to the hotel is that the restaurant seems to be somewhat expensive.
[-0.8450164794921875] The worst part of the stay however was finding two LARGE insects or animals, something in the room!
