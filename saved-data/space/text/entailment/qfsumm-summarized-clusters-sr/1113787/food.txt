[-0.9973354339599609] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9972982406616211] Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an "upscale" hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.965245246887207] Furthermore, room service was closed at 10 pm, front desk was unhelpful (in ordering a pizza nonetheless) and Charlie Palmer was a waste of time and energy (great staff, HORRIBLE management.)
[-0.9538946151733398] Since the squid and quail eggs on their menu did not sound good, one of our group walked across the street to order some Food and bring it over.
[-0.9441432952880859] Charlie Palmer cooks the room service menu but it is different menu than restaurant and didn't look as good (no foie gras).

[0.418212890625] They had free bottle of wine and chocolates in our room for our anniversary which was nice but I had to ask 3 times for ice bucket (it is small hotel so there are no ice machines on the floors).
[0.2147216796875] the romance package is worth the upgrade because it includes champagne, valet parking, chocolates and breakfast, and they even cover the bed with rose petals if/when you leave the room after check-in.
[0.203582763671875] They had a bottle of champagne,yummy chocolates and a cheese platter in the room.
[0.11212158203125] The room was immaculate - superbly decorated, super clean, and there was a complimentary bottle of champagne for us, with truffles and a lovely note from the manager.

[-0.9867420196533203] The only down-side for us (because we're not as young as we used to be) was the night life (we were there on a Friday night) on the street kicks in at about midnight and continues with great enthusiasm until about 4am.
[-0.9834480285644531] Even with it being first come, first serve, the service only had about a 10 minute wait on a Saturday night.
[-0.9818267822265625] We were staying only one night and were most looking forward to lounging leisurely next to the beautiful pool on Sunday afternoon.
[-0.9769668579101562] Then Saturday evening after having night of fun on town came back to order room service it took 45 mins.
[-0.9757232666015625] Everything is good and after a Thursday night at the Ritz Bar, the PM lounge is your next best bet.

[-0.9898357391357422] As an order of french toast was around $20 I decided to walk down the street (out the front, down one block to left, take a left and Seven Eleven was on the right) and get a donut and some milk.
