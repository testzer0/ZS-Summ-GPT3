[0.26959228515625] Downtown area around it is sort of dead... the structure itself is a period building, renovated into a boutique hotel.
[0.14703369140625] It might be where the young people of Texas go to spend their money on dinner and drinks in the bar but its not the place to stay overnight.

[0.504302978515625] 2 - We stayed in the Demi-Joule room and it was very small.
[0.38818359375] The rooms are tiny and open like most W's and the focus on being trendy, not on customer service nor amenities.
[0.27044677734375] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[0.267425537109375] The Joule is not luxurious in comparison and not sure why Starwood has it branded as such.

[0.077545166015625] The accomodations were wonderful, the canti-levered pool was gorgeous and the lobby ultra chiq...but the best attribute by far was the care and attention to detail given by Henry and the valet staff!
[0.06719970703125] The owner is an art collector so the lobby was decorated with pieces from his own personal collection.
