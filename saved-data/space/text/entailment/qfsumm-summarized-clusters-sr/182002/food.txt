[-0.7254524230957031] An annoyance rather than trouble really.

[0.3103790283203125] The Internet was complimentary(wireless) made it convienent to check my email from my room.
[0.24847412109375] It comes very useful if you don't want to drive in downtown.
[0.22730255126953125] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).

[-0.6056861877441406] An annoyance rather than trouble really.
[-0.42047119140625] #1) Business Centre: no paper in printer, no pens, no envelopes, wi-fi slow and potentially virused #2) Several of the desk staff were cold and flat in their behaviour.
[-0.3869171142578125] THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.
[-0.3786468505859375] The biggest disappointments were: -Elevators (being "updated", bumpy ride, not reliable-ended up on a floor we didn't know we could access!)

[0.8537578582763672] My other reason for choosing this hotel was the fact that they have free wireless internet access which was much needed.
[0.825042724609375] I was also glad that the hotel had free internet access as I had to spend a great deal of time working, and not having to lug everything to a computer room instead of working from my bedroom was very convenient.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9046554565429688] They at least lent us an external wifi card but it still didn't work.
[-0.8585700988769531] Also which was bothersome was the wifi.
[-0.7946090698242188] The Wi-Fi service in the room was undependable, the 40+ kgb reception would suddenly drop to 1Kgb and unuseable, then it would flip up to perhaps 18 kbs and back to 1 kgb.
[-0.6177864074707031] THEY GAVE US WRONG DIRECTIONS.
[-0.5848350524902344] In my entire life, I have never been treated in such a rude, disrespecting manner.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9800872802734375] I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump.
[-0.9734344482421875] Although it would have been more convenient for me to stay at the hotel the meeting was in, their prices were far too expensive for my budget.
[-0.9295196533203125] This was one of the worst experiences I have ever with a hotel room that cost $160 a night.
[-0.9215927124023438] When we arrived at the Hilton (which we really couldnâ€™t afford, but were tired and in desperate need of a clean place to stay), staff noted that â€œThe Primroseâ€� Best Western was know for their bedbugs!!!
[-0.9045677185058594] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8994522094726562] We are working people with three kids and we dont have a lot of quality time to spend together so when we get the chance we come to the Primrose and here is why: 1) Our favorite room is reserved without us having to ask for it.

[-0.9837684631347656] I had to stay an extra night in Toronto and found that my existing hotel (Sheraton Centre) was sold out for the Monday so I had to make a last minute reservation at another hotel.
[-0.9767379760742188] None of the 'perks' of the hotel were available-pool, steam room, gym, and the TV was old and hardly worked.
[-0.936126708984375] We were assigned two double beds and told that a King was not available.
[-0.91888427734375] Before checking in, they rudely told us that the parking space we had requested had been given to someone else and that we were to go down the street to public parking lot.
[-0.8953857421875] They did not allow us to use the laundry because we were not students (no sense to me).
