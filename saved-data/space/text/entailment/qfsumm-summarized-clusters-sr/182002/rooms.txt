[0.0590667724609375] This is a decent hotel, but factor in the low prices, great location and little perks like free wi-fi, and I'd say that it's one of the best I've stayed in.
[0.0185546875] I would describe it as typical Best Western standard 3 star hotel quality, nothing special and no frills.
[0.017498016357421875] Other than the hotel is OK, but far from great.
[0.0159149169921875] The price is very good and the rooms are large, the only issue with the hotel is its very dated and could do with a revamp.

[0.24365234375] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.1549072265625] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.1400146484375] The parking garage was a little tight to drive around in, but other than that, I would definately go back for another weekend with the guys.
[0.01641845703125] Also, the hotel parking has a height limit of 6 feet, so, since we were driving a GMC Yukon, it was not available to us anyway.

[-0.9972023963928223] Also which was bothersome was the wifi.
[-0.9971485137939453] What did bother me though was the cleanliness.
[-0.9963908195495605] We spent the whole weekend shopping, clubbing and eating.
[-0.9953148365020752] The two main things I did apprieciate was, the free wireless internet, and the fact there was a Tim hortons right in the lobby.
