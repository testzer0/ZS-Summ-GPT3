[0.4852294921875] The rental agency was farther than they said, and my back got worse.
[0.4449462890625] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
[0.3509368896484375] The hotel was sold out for both nights we were there and we didn't hear any neighbours, ever.
[0.34356689453125] I spoke with the front desk and they gave me a room as far away as possible, I did have to do a little convincing but it was no problem to be moved.

[0.557159423828125] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
[0.5433349609375] Anyway, we called visa and it turns out that the Hotel had been entering the wrong expiry date.
[0.3506927490234375] Incidentally, the valet brought up the wrong car, notwithstanding that there were probably few cars with Virginia license plates in the garage.
[0.309661865234375] Not a bad place for _recreational_ travelers But the desk clerks could not figure out that for business travel, two people might have two reservations to share one room -- not, as the clerks set it up, for one to be the guest of the other (which also means no "HHonors" points for the "guest).

[0.125579833984375] Tell us how you liked the room - Had a 2 queen bed room - very spacious and beds were extremely comfortable.
[0.119415283203125] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.

[0.29691314697265625] All in all, a nice place, but I would only stay there if they could assure me that I would not be on that side of the building!
[0.212860107421875] You can self-park but being right downtown I figured it wasn't worth the hassle to save a few bucks.
[0.132720947265625] I would recommend staying on a floor higher than 10, I am a light sleeper and woke up at 230-330 AM after the bars let out and there was a lot of noise below!
[0.10807418823242188] my boyfriend and i both went home sore and dead tired from trying to find a comfortable way to sleep tossing and turning all night but there was none.

Parent: The reviewers said that the location was not that great because it was hard to find a parking spot and the staff was not very helpful.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8922576904296875] Very easy to get to - but parking is an issue and the rate of $35.00 / day is very steep.
[0.8242874145507812] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[0.2038726806640625] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[0.1981658935546875] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.
[0.163482666015625] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9802699089050293] There are lots of parking lots near by that look cheaper than the hotel valet system (one right across the road).
[-0.7889289855957031] Valets were excellent with our vehicle.
[-0.7719087600708008] The hotel is very conveniently located in downtown Toronto and overall the stay was very satisfactory for the price.

[-0.7229194641113281] I think the valet parking at the hotel is around the same amount and you can take your car in and out as needed.

[0.4456787109375] The staff were very friendly and unintrusive, check in and check out were quick, under 5 mins.

[0.6566276550292969] The location is too noisy because of the nightclub.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6566276550292969] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.5635223388671875] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.36823272705078125] The only issue was that it was VERY NOISY at night having multiple clubs right outside the front doors.
[0.351409912109375] The week-end floozies everywhere and drunken partners are too much !
[0.3339729309082031] From the 17th floor we could be awakened from the thump thump of the disco music at 3am on a Saturday night !

[-0.8903656005859375] We were extremely inconvenienced (mother in law in hospital).
[-0.7868232727050781] my boyfriend and i both went home sore and dead tired from trying to find a comfortable way to sleep tossing and turning all night but there was none.
[-0.7577114105224609] Try not to get a room on that side, even high up.
[-0.668548583984375] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.
[-0.6331329345703125] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.

[0.9787964820861816] However, it's right next to a really noisy nightclub.
[0.9777731895446777] Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.
[0.9726457595825195] Also note that there is a very busy club right next door to the entrance of this hotel.
[0.9425640106201172] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.9104394912719727] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.

[0.8810691833496094] The only 2 things I didn't appreciate were out of the control of the hotel: first there is a club right next to the hotel and we could hear the loud music coming from the club late at night (being on the 3rd and 15th floor).
[0.8108100891113281] The Saturday night rave at the local night spot was fairly noisy and interrupted our sleep.

[0.9555997848510742] Parking rates are high as you will find in all major cities around the world.
[0.933837890625] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.
[0.8350334167480469] It was worth the cost of the parking just to have their assistance.
