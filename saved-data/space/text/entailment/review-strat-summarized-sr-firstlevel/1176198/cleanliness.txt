[0.8316650390625] There are areas of the hotel that could be improved.
Parent: Overall, it seems that the hotel is generally clean, but there may be some areas that need improvement.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8316650390625] All in all a great experience at the hotel...only thing they need to improve on is the wi-fi which really needs to be better than it was.
[0.5473480224609375] Pros: room very clean and well-lit; staff extremely helpful; extra comfortable beds (probably one of the best hotel beds I've slept in) Cons: room internet was very slow except for very basic email checks; breakfast room was understaffed so that two frantic staff-members were running around looking very flustered and struggling to deal with all the guests
[0.5375862121582031] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[0.5276374816894531] This was a saturday night - I do not know if it is the same any other night of the week, but I would definitely ask to stay on the north side of the hotel and up higher if I ever travelled there again.
[0.5029983520507812] Say what you liked best & least - The best part in my opinion was the view of the CN Tower, but not every room will have that - other than that it would have to be the room size and beds.

[-0.969975471496582] Never in my life have I spent so much in one place and been treated so poorly.
[-0.9529151916503906] We requested to have a maid clean our bathroom and take the trash out, no one ever came!
[-0.9362907409667969] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
[-0.9279937744140625] Hotel rooms and restaurant = great "Valet" = brutal and ruined the whole stay.
