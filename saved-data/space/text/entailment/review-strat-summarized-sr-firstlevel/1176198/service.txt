[0.3117218017578125] Hotel rooms and restaurant = great "Valet" = brutal and ruined the whole stay.
[0.26590538024902344] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
[0.1135101318359375] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.

[0.490020751953125] Not a bad place for _recreational_ travelers But the desk clerks could not figure out that for business travel, two people might have two reservations to share one room -- not, as the clerks set it up, for one to be the guest of the other (which also means no "HHonors" points for the "guest).
[0.4018096923828125] There was a slight mix up with our booking but no fuss was made although I did find the reception staff a little disinterested but nothing to spoil my stay.

[0.8358306884765625] We tried to exchange our American money and the hotel tried to charge us a rate that would give us LESS money back even though the American dollar was worth about $1.20 that day.
[0.7940750122070312] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended
[0.7754364013671875] Then we asked the hotel (after we parked our car in the public parking) and they said that we'd pay $35 until 3 pm!!
[0.699951171875] Not until the next day after we checked out did we find out that the rate was THIRTY FIVE cents difference on each dollar and when you do the math they make a very nice profit off of unsuspecting American tourists.

[-0.7552108764648438] Arrived early 10.15 and asked if I could leave my bags and check in later, the girl on the desk let me check in straight away, a real bonus when sometimes they make you wait until 3pm.
