[0.5424270629882812] The wallpaper in the bathroom and our room was warped, bubbled, etc.
[0.5124053955078125] This night was a bit of a mess; we would walk out to the hallway and smell weed, hear loud music blasting, etc.
[0.28459930419921875] We requested to have a maid clean our bathroom and take the trash out, no one ever came!
[0.27545166015625] Plus the spa had too much chlorine in and that my eye's were stinging.
[0.2560272216796875] There were weird grease marks on the wall as well.

[0.4846038818359375] The rooms were too noisy.
Parent: The guests felt that the rooms were dirty and noisy, and that the hotel did not do a good job of accommodating their requests.

----- Supporting -----

[0.4846038818359375] That was a bit of a pain, but understandable, because it was getting extremely rowdy and it was clear people were bringing in about 10 people into one room.
[0.25469970703125] Being in the heart of the entertainment district may be a plus for some but for me it means that you can't leave your window open at night for fresh air because of all the noise from the late night revellers.
[0.23260498046875] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.
[0.211578369140625] I would recommend staying on a floor higher than 10, I am a light sleeper and woke up at 230-330 AM after the bars let out and there was a lot of noise below!
[0.199371337890625] (once we figured out how to work all the shower heads) The walls were very thin though-we could really hear our neighbours mini party at 2AM in the morning.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9982585906982422] Despite this (and some of the other reviews), I found that the hotel is quiet and I was never disturbed by what is going outside.
[-0.9982247352600098] The room was comfortable, clean and spacious and quiet.
[-0.998093843460083] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
[-0.9973597526550293] Night club outside was busy, but we heard nothing from our room.
[-0.9973061084747314] Did not hear a thing the whole time we were there.

Parent: The guests felt that the rooms were dirty and noisy, and that the hotel did not do a good job of accommodating their requests.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7977523803710938] Another issue I had is that we always ask for a room on an upper floor, this is the only Hilton on our entire trip that did not honor our request.
[0.6561279296875] Not a bad place for _recreational_ travelers But the desk clerks could not figure out that for business travel, two people might have two reservations to share one room -- not, as the clerks set it up, for one to be the guest of the other (which also means no "HHonors" points for the "guest).
[0.4096794128417969] We requested a later check out and they would not accommodate this....which I have never had happen before.
[0.3470458984375] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.
[0.33306884765625] We were given a regular room and when we called to ask to have our room replaced with another Jacuzzi room it took 25 minutes for the front desk to call us back.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9926118850708008] Lots of thought has gone in to making guests happy, with a huge flat screen TV, very comfy bed, noon check-out, blackout curtains, fridge and fab bathroom with the huge shower/jet enclosure and nice toiletries!
[-0.9895553588867188] The hotel staff was very nice and let us leave our luggage before and after check in so that we can go around the city.
[-0.9889159202575684] Everything was to our standards, and all of our needs were met.
[-0.9882259368896484] Breakfast was wonderful- the staff encouraged us to take whatever we wanted to go - with paper bags made available.
[-0.9874382019042969] Exceptional service!

----- Supporting -----

[0.1526031494140625] Clearly they need more than two valet guys working on a Sunday morning when everyone is checking out for the weekend There was a party going on at 1-2AM beside one of our rooms.
[0.0873870849609375] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
[0.0758209228515625] Front desk person said we could get into two adjoining rooms right away, but each room only had a king bed and a pull-out couch.
[0.0650634765625] The 20 minute wait the following morning for the car wasn't good either especially as I could have parked across the street for $15 dollars rather than the $36 the hotel charge, Overall recommended
[0.04265594482421875] Two nights we did have a guest, who had orginally intended to attend the conference: despite being assured on the phone that we could add a rollaway for him, when he arrived, we couldn't, and he and my colleague had to split a regular bed.

[0.9755592346191406] I have stayed at this Hilton Garden on Peter street on business many, many times-so when planning a weekend visit with the family I had no hesitation to book- Its well situated, clean and modern and generally a very good value and the Hhnonors perks are good- WOW what a difference during the weekend-instead of business folk and tourists-its packed with club kids and partyers-the staff do their best-but its noisy and the area around the hotel is pretty crazy late in the evening on weekends- I will stay again during the week-but never on a weekend
