[0.746734619140625] The marble tile floors in the rooms make for easy management of the pet-friendly policy, so I don't mark this hotel down for that as some other reviewers have mentioned.
[0.6265869140625] They also have pet friendly rooms with tiled floors.
[0.29534912109375] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.

[0.43702125549316406] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
[0.054935455322265625] The service in the restaurant was a bit snobbish and I didn't get the condiments I requested the second morning, however this is minor in my opinion.
[0.046848297119140625] Initially they were less than courteous about it but i said if there is a charge of course i would play however it might be helpful for future guests to be escorted to the bike and given a brief safety instruction prior to giving someone a key.

[-0.399169921875] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.38128662109375] If you're looking to stay at a big hi-rise in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown, then this place is not for you.
[-0.36785125732421875] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.

[0.08367919921875] A tiny problem, but big when you are in a hurry: offer better hair dryers than the low-powered one provided.

Parent: Local calls are charged for at the hotel.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8952789306640625] And what kind of hotel charges for local calls?!
[0.548553466796875] And the hotel is a $10 cab ride from downtown or you can take a water taxi to the edge of the downtown area.
[0.4891510009765625] We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel because it was close to the Stanley Theatre and a $12 cab fare to downtown.
[0.19244384765625] All of that said, I would still stay here again, but would be prepared for needing cash for taxis.
[0.16217041015625] Couldn't have asked for a better location, and although we stayed in August, parking never seemed to be an issue except that it was $12.00 plus tax .....ouch!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9480209350585938] Normally, you can only park for 3 hours on the island, which isn't nearly enough time to wander around and see everything, but the hotel offers free parking.
[-0.8416976928710938] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[-0.8386631011962891] The staff at the hotel were very friendly and accomodating, and we used the free internet and printer in the lobby to research the bus lines.
[-0.8375015258789062] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[-0.7230148315429688] The hotel brought in free pastries and coffee every morning, while the restaurant was being refurbished.

[-0.9947090148925781] That being said, my room was only okay.
[-0.9909944534301758] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.9901332855224609] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.9900321960449219] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.9807806015014648] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.

[-0.9430465698242188] My rating would have been 5 stars, except the room was quite small for two people 5 days, and the only view was over a roof and hvac unit.
[-0.7111673355102539] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.

[-0.8420372009277344] They told us they thought it was a false alarm...Granville Island is a great place to visit w/kids - lots to do and a fun water park.

[-0.8555374145507812] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
