[0.4581298828125] The hotel is perfectly acceptable, but does not stand out.
[0.40264892578125] It was an acceptable hotel, but definitely not worth the outlandish price.
[0.382232666015625] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[0.364837646484375] The rooms are fairly well equipped, and on the surface look good, however the fittings when you look closely at them are not top quality, and will not last.

[0.5716629028320312] This is a great hotel and obviously a favorite with discerning locals having events...they weren't really an obstruction to our having a great time, but did become something of a joke as both the hotel and adjoining park/marina/galleries are dripping with wedding parties.
[0.5539684295654297] My 11 year old daughter marvelled at the Toy Store, loved the food fudge vendors and even the buskers tunes.
[0.509552001953125] Our girls loved the decent-sized hot tube with the windowed ceiling that allowed us to watch the starts at night.

[0.9771404266357422] This hotel is located close enough to downtown to walk to in 1/2 hour( using the aquabus to cross the channel) but also very close to local interesting sites on granville island and is a 15 min walk to Broadway St and 4th Ave where there are numerous placed to eat.
[0.9018745422363281] We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel because it was close to the Stanley Theatre and a $12 cab fare to downtown.
[0.8771896362304688] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[0.8636093139648438] If you're looking for a smaller (decent sized) hotel with a relaxed environment (not to mention romantic), and is a 3 minute drive (5 minute water taxi ride) from downtown Vancouver, then this IS the hotel for you.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9146060943603516] Basically a food market and some specialist shops.
[-0.8944854736328125] The location is FANTASTIC for anyone who wants to be close to downtown but not right in the middle of the busy traffic and challenging parking.
[-0.880859375] The market itself is so interesting and the food is wonderful.
[-0.8734703063964844] Close to the market, the Arts Club Theatre, funky shops and downtown.
[-0.8578948974609375] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.

[0.7568435668945312] Although the hotel has parking for a daily fee, it is best not to bring your car as the island is definitely best seen on foot and driving on the island is difficult as pedestrians are everywhere.
[0.7444686889648438] I'd have given it 5 stars if only the desk chair hadn't had arms and been a royal pain to move around.

[0.9381237030029297] The hotel provides some wonderful views of the harbour and the rooms are modern and clean.
[0.8727397918701172] The hotel setting is very nice with water and dock views.
[0.841827392578125] Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.

[-0.598114013671875] My rating would have been 5 stars, except the room was quite small for two people 5 days, and the only view was over a roof and hvac unit.

[0.9446682929992676] The hotel is not far from the Aqua Bus, taxis, and the Granville Island Public Market making it easy to get around.
[0.8741416931152344] This hotel is located close enough to downtown to walk to in 1/2 hour( using the aquabus to cross the channel) but also very close to local interesting sites on granville island and is a 15 min walk to Broadway St and 4th Ave where there are numerous placed to eat.
[0.8060340881347656] To get there, we took the quick little ferry from downtown, and walked with our rolling suitcases to the hotel, conveniently located and yet away from any traffic.
[0.7584457397460938] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[0.7406940460205078] The Big Bus hop onhop off goes fairly close to the hotel (5-7 min walk) Live Music played most nights from Restaurant which while very good when you have a full day and want to sleep it would go until about midnight.

[-0.32537841796875] quiet at night without the often ugly street level scene you encounter at more glamorous high-rises (yes the high-rises can give you great views but coming out at street level you feel like you've walked into a seedy bus station environment).
