[-0.9858245849609375] The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace.
[-0.97589111328125] One of the downsides to this motel is the location.
[-0.959503173828125] The location is less than optimal - the northern edge of Downtown.
[-0.9556303024291992] We tried to take the stairs, but there is no direct route to the lobby and ended up on a wild goose chase around the building.
[-0.9295692443847656] Btw, when you arrive at the hotel, it is quite confusing where the check in is located (2nd floor).

[0.974785327911377] But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking.
[0.2698211669921875] When we arrived for a one night stay, (we were catching a cruise ship the next morning) the one bell hop at the entrance did not greet us, or offer to help, or open a door.
[0.1446990966796875] One issue with the executive lounge access - hotel literature stated the lounge should have been open from 6.00 am - this was not the case and when we arrived on one occasion to grab breakfast before leaving for the day we were told to "try later lounge not opening yet staff had not arrived".
[0.121673583984375] The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it.
[0.08907699584960938] In this case, I would suggest more signage for those arriving at the hotel.

[0.16314697265625] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace
