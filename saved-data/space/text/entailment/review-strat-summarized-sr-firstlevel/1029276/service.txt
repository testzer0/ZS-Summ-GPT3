[0.692626953125] Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
[0.3292236328125] Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs.
[0.32684326171875] $28/day for valet and $25/day self parking...very expensive Blood stains on pillow cases...contacted front desk about the issue and they reacted like it was a normal thing and would mention it to housekeeping.
[0.29931640625] Though I found the hotel very pricey (for us) I'm sure you could get a much better rate on line.

Parent: There were also some comments about the area not being safe to walk around in, but this did not seem to be a reflection of the service at the hotel itself.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9857029914855957] The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in.
[0.9228334426879883] Downtown did not feel safe at all, and there were alot of unsavoury looks as we did walk 4 blocks from the Hotel.
[0.36852264404296875] No room safe or fridge - ice down the hall.
[0.3681449890136719] Our only gripe was the area... We live in the NE of England so are used to a bit of rough and tumble but upon leaving the hotel each time we felt really uneasy!!!
[0.2604217529296875] Not only did the three of us feel unsafe but we were scared to stay in the room for fear the guard might have access to our room.

[0.753204345703125] In spite of everything, the hotel coped very well and it was great - food, staff, room, lounge all excellent.
[0.63677978515625] The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
[0.606597900390625] We found the hotel faultless, really clean, excellent service and really good value for money!
[0.59869384765625] As we had a car ,the location was not a problem.South Beach is just a short drive across the bridge and we took a taxi to Bayside.We ordered room service for breakfast and it was excellent.
[0.271087646484375] When we finally got to the lobby (because it's a little bit tricky) it was full of people checking in, but everything ran just perfect thanks to the professionalism and friendly attitude of the front desk agents.

[-0.9887828826904297] My opinion is that this motel was extremely unorganized during this time.
[-0.9856414794921875] The breakfast was actually the highlight but the service at this hotel was disorganized and rude!
[-0.9785614013671875] The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies.
[-0.9697790145874023] Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business.
[-0.9689474105834961] But, there were no sheets available and we had to call down to housekeeping at 2am (when we arrived) to get sheets.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9928479194641113] The service is unbelievably slow.
[0.9435806274414062] Really have never been through a slower check in - problem was that I was behind about 25 foreign tourists, which is what appears to make up the majority of this hotel's clientel.
[0.8692550659179688] Of course the downside was that the elevators were slow, depending on what time of the day it was ..but the way people complain on here, you would think it was the end of the world.
[0.640655517578125] Because you will complain that the elevators are slow....that the elevators are warm....It will always be something and frankly you would complain if you were given the room for free.
[0.51312255859375] Bar service at busy times was a little haphazard - incorrect orders although they did make amends for errors.

[-0.9939079284667969] We did valid parking (max 28 dollar a day), no problem checking in and out, they are fast.
[-0.9937186241149902] We arrived there after a very long flight from Ireland and we were delighted to have such a fast check in and such friendly service.
[-0.9871587753295898] I didnt like the looks of the free continental breakfast so I ordered room service and it was tasty and arrived quickly.

[0.9602527618408203] Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all.
[0.9296379089355469] I enjoyed staying here but I don't understand why there isn't free internet like in all other hotels I stayed in during my 3-week vacation.
[0.7637653350830078] Cons: hotel loud, construction going on outside, Internet is not free.

[-0.9907217025756836] The executive lounge had new Dell computers, wifi internet access was available throughout the hotel (including the pool area) -- free for gold and diamond members.
[-0.9884724617004395] Good amenities without a lot of nickel-and-diming, eg, free high-speed Internet with 5 or 6 terminals and connected printers.
[-0.9741640090942383] They also had a business center with free internet access for guests, so we were able to check our flight info, which was a big help.
