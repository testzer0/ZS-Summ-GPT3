[0.7466888427734375] I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place.
[0.16416168212890625] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!

[0.07104110717773438] As we arrived we parked on the street, there was constructiono but being that we live on Sobe we knew the area and parking area well...so we avoided the $29 valet parking per day....We were greeted by Andrew, excellent front desk person who gave us a room on the high floor....I told him it was my birthday weekend and he tried to make it very special for me and my family...we then went to lobby to wait for room, excellent service also...The service at every place we went was superb...i even thought i wasn't in Miami...lol..everyone super friendly....the pool bartender also....In the executive lounge, service was great too...nothing to complaint....our room had a great view of the port and bayside also miami beach and the bed was amazing.......

[0.61138916015625] Anyway if you have a car it takes 3 minutes to go to South Beach and it is better spend money for a good hotel in downtown compared to a fake design hotel in SOBE.
[0.57476806640625] For me, it's the little details that make a hotel worth the money, and the Hilton just doesn't have the attention to detail that a hotel of its caliber should.

[-0.674835205078125] I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel close to the Miami port and I would definitely stay here again.
[-0.67333984375] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[-0.6697540283203125] This hotel was booked for us through our travel agent - it was near the airport & near the port of Miami where we were leaving on a cruise.
