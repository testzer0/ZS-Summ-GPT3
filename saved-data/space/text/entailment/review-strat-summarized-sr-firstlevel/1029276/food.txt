[0.9534397125244141] The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it.

[0.2619285583496094] Cold fat soaked bacon, processed meats, and very expensive.
[0.1967010498046875] To further my aggravation, the hotel information stated that a continental breakfast buffet was included, however when we went down the dining area and got the kids some food and sat down to eat is when we were informed that the breakfast was not included, since we were already sitting and eating it was a little too late to get up and leave, add another $60 to the bill and my deal is now no deal.
[0.12472152709960938] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
[0.047027587890625] Coming from Europe, it takes some time to get used to the "rip me off at every corner" culture in the States, but this was just going too far.
