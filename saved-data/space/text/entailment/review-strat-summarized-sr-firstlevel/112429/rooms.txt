Parent: The rooms are suspect for making people ill.

[0.508575439453125] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[0.36441802978515625] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.20420074462890625] The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit.
[0.171875] The only thing I didn't care for was the fitness center, which was sort of a dungeon in the basement.
[0.15375900268554688] The biggest issue is that upon going to bed the first night, I noticed an overpowering smell of urine in my bed.

[0.1558704376220703] The Paramount was a lovely hotel.

[0.9764676094055176] The hotel is a perfect location -- a block from the Seattle Convention Center/Conference Center, which was very convenient.
[0.9738826751708984] This hotel is conveniently located in downtown Seattle.
[0.9522457122802734] And in a hotel that is very affordable and nicely located.
[0.9090442657470703] The hotel was very well positioned to do that being central to all the major downtown stores and Pike Pklace Market.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9593315124511719] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.9298629760742188] I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.

[-0.9828071594238281] I do think this hotel is going to raise their rates and won't be worth it unless they pay attention to what guests on here are saying.
[-0.9694442749023438] The room-service was way overpriced for mediocre food though.
[-0.9200477600097656] Your only option for room service (aside from breakfast) is overpriced -- tasty, but overpriced -- Asian cuisine from Dragonfish.

[0.536468505859375] The rooms are too small.
Parent: However, some guests have complained about the small size of the rooms and the lack of a breakfast buffet.

[0.536468505859375] That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room.
[0.1854248046875] The bathroom is the size of a closet and the hot water took forever to warm up.
[0.079254150390625] They did provide us with roll-away beds but then there was no room to move around in the room.
