[0.6116294860839844] We stayed with a group recently and all had a good time....the group had experienced problems unrelated to the hotel but when we got there the treatment and service we received was wonderful.....we were made to feel right at home......I believe Joe was the gentleman who greeted us and was very kind and professional.....Maryann (I think that was her name) in the breakfast room was an absolute angel.....she went out of her way to make everyone feel special........this is an excellent choice for groups-affordable......receptive to needs.......Also the in charge cleaning lady was very professional and friendly.
[0.1419677734375] Breakfast was very good; I am a relatively picky eater and I don't understand why other reviews complain about the breakfast, especially given the cost of this hotel.
