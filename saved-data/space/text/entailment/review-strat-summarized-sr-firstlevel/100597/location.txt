[0.3529052734375] Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.

[-0.9355344772338867] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.

[0.23541259765625] Great for those early morning flights, and no worries about traffic jams as Seatac Airport is right across the street.

[0.03554534912109375] If I had been wanting to stay for more than one night, be close to anything interesting (other than the artificially created world of SEATAC), or wanted to get some business done, this would not have been the best hotel.

[0.5676803588867188] The inner hall was quiet but there was a lot of traffic noise from the outside.
[0.557403564453125] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[0.53521728515625] The most disturbing noises came not from the jet planes across the street, but from the hallway.
[0.5316276550292969] It is on a busy street and I didn't see a restaurant within walking distance so I ate in the lobby.

[0.7857284545898438] This hotel is a nice size and is convenient to the airport and restaurants.
[0.759307861328125] You could safely cross the street at the light and crosswalk and find your self at a diner or several other restaurants.

[0.1833953857421875] From reading others reviews I was not in the main towers, and only complaint was only being on the second floor someone was above me and from the sound they made walking must have weighed 400 pounds as it was very loud.

[0.7760238647460938] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.7229843139648438] There are a few restaurants around the hotel area and you can also easily walk to the airport should you want to.
