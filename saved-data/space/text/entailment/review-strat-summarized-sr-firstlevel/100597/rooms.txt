[-0.8623580932617188] You absolutely cannot beat a Doubletree chocolate chip cookie as a welcome treat.
[-0.7305908203125] The restaurant and bar restaurant are better than average and again great staff.
[-0.7148971557617188] Choice of food was excelent.
[-0.713287353515625] It has that "west-coast" feel to it with lots of wood and glimpses of green forrest outside.

[0.6284809112548828] Also nice view of some trees out the balcony.

[0.20597457885742188] It has that "west-coast" feel to it with lots of wood and glimpses of green forrest outside.
[0.18212890625] The view we had was of some large trees and some people's backyards- better than the parking lot for us (but I wouldn't want to live there!).

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8780155181884766] The views of the airplanes taking off was great!

[0.747283935546875] The wing hallways had a damp smell.
[0.5157623291015625] The shuttle was hot and smelly again and people were mad.
[0.02092742919921875] But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9960031509399414] The hotel reception had a lovely smell of freshly baked cookies which were given out at check in and were delicious.

[0.5516891479492188] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
[0.48688507080078125] We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied.
[0.4755363464355469] We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac.
[0.4376983642578125] Despite the low rate, the receptionist tried to give us the type of room I wanted (high floor, one bed) and was very pleasant to me.
[0.42945098876953125] Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9960727691650391] I'm surprised at the negative reviews, I'm a regular Priceline customer, staying at the Doubletree usually once a month and have never had a bad experience.
[-0.994720458984375] The shuttle was hot and smelly again and people were mad.
[-0.9879288673400879] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.9835071563720703] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[-0.97930908203125] To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.

[0.131805419921875] Lovely spacious Doubletree, with gift shop and a very good restaurant inside it.
[0.1197509765625] The rooms in the wings are larger than those in the tower and if you get wings 2 or 3 closer than walking to the tower wing plus no elevator hassle.
[0.096221923828125] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
[0.07135009765625] Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.

[0.09473991394042969] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
