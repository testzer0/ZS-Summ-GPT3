[0.4120941162109375] The room was okay, but not as clean as one would expect.
[0.3802490234375] Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out.

[0.36785888671875] I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car.
[0.34406280517578125] At my prompting he suggested the self-park behind the hotel but it was almost as expensive as the valet!
[0.34368896484375] Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.
[0.33364105224609375] To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to "park and fly", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!!

[-0.9774599075317383] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[-0.9579763412475586] Lots of conveniences close by.
