----- Supporting -----

[0.9878339767456055] Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room.
[0.9872593879699707] This is a huge hotel.
[0.9837713241577148] The hotel is huge and they give you warm cookies once you check-in.

[0.9786381721496582] Granted it's a large hotel and I don't like hiking to a room in another zip code.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.974090576171875] Rooms are not particularly posh or large.

[0.7217559814453125] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[0.650970458984375] --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
[0.6211776733398438] We explored the other areas of this large hotel complex and noticed some rooms were actually are on a small lake, and others overlook the attractive outdoor pool.

[-0.420166015625] After commuting back and fort from florida if too tired to drive back to my destination i always stay at this dbl tree.
[-0.4135894775390625] The hotel is conveniently located, just across the street from the airport entrance with a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes.
[-0.36376953125] If you use their free airport shuttle service, make sure you get on the right shuttle from the airport because there is another Double Tree with a separate shuttle.

[0.764404296875] Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!).
[0.032627105712890625] Also, wished to have their shuttle drop us off @ transit terminal but we were told to wait - we decided to walk and it was rather cold.
[0.020751953125] The tower elevators, which run on the exterior of the building, were quite cold.

[-0.9850263595581055] My husband was hoping there was an indoor pool, but the pool was warm, and the hot tub was awesome.

[-0.9162197113037109] Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water.
[-0.9097652435302734] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[-0.9005546569824219] The tower rooms do have balconies but the space is shared with the room next door and divided by a set of austere looking bars--plus there is no furniture to sit on so the balconies are not really functional.
