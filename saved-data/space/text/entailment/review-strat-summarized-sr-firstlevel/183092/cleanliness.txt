[0.9319877624511719] The rooms were not soundproof.
Parent: It was noted that there was a lack of soundproofing between rooms, which led to guests being able to hear conversations from the next room over.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9319877624511719] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
[0.91070556640625] Because of the adjoining door and no soundproofing between these rooms, I could hear their group conversations as if they were sitting next to me.
[0.8889617919921875] My only complaint would be that the room could be more sound proof.
[0.642822265625] This was incredibly annoying and extremely loud in our room.

[0.7539100646972656] Great service, friendly staff, good food - pity the room wiater couldn't go further than the threshold !!!!
[0.373260498046875] I tried to hook up my computer to the internet in the room afterwards, but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue.
[0.18062973022460938] I was happy to get this hotel for $159/night - though internet was slow and added $16 dollars per day (though it included all calls - or so i thought until i got my bill and they had charged me $40 worth of long distance calls - they were promptly removed).
[0.0640869140625] i think this is a good value for the area except for the internet charges which were high for such a slow connection.
[0.04821586608886719] I was disappointed with the Internet service, though: $15 + $3 service charge daily, from noon to noon, with some interruptions.

[0.7009735107421875] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.

[0.9586677551269531] My biggest negative would be the super thin, over starched towels.

Parent: The reviews mentioned that the hotel was generally clean, with a few exceptions such as dust bunnies or a messy breakfast buffet.

----- Supporting -----

[0.1964111328125] There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.
[0.06333160400390625] The rest of my stay was great but definately need to get a new system in place for business travellers.. Id recommend Hilton Downtown or Marriott Airport Locations for Business Trips.
[0.047855377197265625] They also really need more than 1 elevator to the parking garage.
[0.04349517822265625] Other than that one tiny mishap, our stay was WONDERFUL and I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers, and would stay at the Marriott again myself.
[0.03636932373046875] The lobby refurb looked great -- now they just need to tackle some of the older rooms.

[-0.9299936294555664] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.8336124420166016] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
