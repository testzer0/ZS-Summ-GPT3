----- Weakening -----

[-0.9893531799316406] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.

[-0.0066375732421875] Parking is also expensive at $18 per day and the garage was small.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9331960678100586] It had an underground bridge linking it to the Eaton Centre Mall and the a subway station.
[-0.9298591613769531] You would think the 4 elevators would be empty at that hour.
[-0.9136009216308594] The shower however was very touchy and the water was either scalding hot or very cold.
[-0.8970565795898438] The pool was quite small, but suitable for the children to use.
[-0.8928337097167969] Because of the adjoining door and no soundproofing between these rooms, I could hear their group conversations as if they were sitting next to me.

[0.8578453063964844] If you have children under 8 they will love the fairground at centreville on the islands but avoid Wonderland unless you have teenage children who can go by themselves, the queues were over an hour long for many rides and it feels bleak and bland.
[0.6131706237792969] The wait for an elevator to the parking garage was quite long.
[0.5716781616210938] The only negative for the guestroom was that the shower seemed to take an inordinately long time to achieve warm/hot water...literally 2-3 minutes.
[0.4170684814453125] I was on the 10th floor, it took forever for the shower to get hot and when it did the temperature fluctuated radically from luke warm to scalding.
[0.4024925231933594] toronto air express bus to airport was fast - take a $10 cab to get picked up at westin then $20 to take bus - o/w will sit on bus for 40 minutes before you even leave for the airport (still better than $60 taxi).

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9236383438110352] Book-in online was quick and easy, check-in was a breeze and they even gave us a free upgrade to a bedroom suite to celebrate the occassion.
