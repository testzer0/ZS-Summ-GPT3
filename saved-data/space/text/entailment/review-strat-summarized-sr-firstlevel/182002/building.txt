[0.76947021484375] After much searching for a decent hotel at a cheap rate in downtown Toronto, we finally settled on the Primrose Hotel.
[0.7548904418945312] We had a good time in the city and would use the Primrose Hotel again.
[0.741180419921875] We stayed in Toronto at the Primrose hotel which was great cuz it was right downtown.

[-0.8653984069824219] The underground parking is horribly laid out.
[-0.8409347534179688] Got a room without a reservation at the Primrose Hotel which was right beside an underground train stop.

[0.9326744079589844] When I complained about the elevators and wireless he just stood there with no apology or good explanation other than it would be too expensive to fix the elevators and it was all the guests' fault anyway for the elevator getting stuck since there were 8 people in the elevator (it's rated for 12 people).
