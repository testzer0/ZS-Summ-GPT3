[-0.8484344482421875] The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car.

[0.8865652084350586] We got a room on the 16th floor with great views of the city , Our room had a big comfortable double bed.

[0.9263992309570312] We have never been to Canada before or to a huge city like Toronto, we found it very easy to get around, Primrose hotel is an excellent location as the subway is only 5min walk way .There is a lot of restaurants , bars, stores ,drugmarts and shops within walking distance also Dundas sq , Eaton centre &hockey Hall of Fame are close by.
[0.8917322158813477] The location is good being a short walk into town and is close to the new Loblaws food emporium at Maple Leaf Gardens.
[0.8456611633300781] We also experienced the subway and found it was very easy to get around.
[0.8313884735107422] I thought the hotel was in a good location and I found it was easy to walk to restaurants at night.
[0.8064556121826172] The hotel was in a good location and it was easy to get a cab just outside the hotel to the clubs.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9958271980285645] It is worth noting that the parking garage has very little clearance, and some of the tightest turns I have ever had to negotiate.
[-0.9955663681030273] The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car.
[-0.9936943054199219] The parking garage was a little tight to drive around in, but other than that, I would definately go back for another weekend with the guys.
[-0.9936013221740723] In the meantime people get stuck very often in seems.
[-0.9934659004211426] We were lost in a city we HAD never been in for 10 mintues during the night.

[0.9818487167358398] The hotel has a parking garage.
Parent: The only complaints were about the parking garage being hard to manoevre and the hotel being located near a subway station.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9818487167358398] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.9563789367675781] The hotel parking was a little expensive (CAN $15) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or SUV.
[0.9500808715820312] The hotel was clean, modern and the only concern that I had was the limited parking in the hotel garage.
[0.9383430480957031] For me, I believe that if a hotel has a parking garage that it should have adequate space reserved for hotel patrons regardless if they are going to use it or not.
[0.88677978515625] We needed a special hotel key for the parking lot elevator, the one we were given for the elevator did not work, so we had to ask the front desk.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9234542846679688] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[-0.8361587524414062] The laundry facilitys are in poor quality.
[-0.8239517211914062] Before checking in, they rudely told us that the parking space we had requested had been given to someone else and that we were to go down the street to public parking lot.
[-0.8120040893554688] And when you are at the park don't forget to visit the Greenhouse.

[0.915191650390625] I would suggest this hotel if coming to visit the Church Street Village for nightlife and if you wish to visit the rest of the city a subway station is within easy walking distance.
[0.8787689208984375] This hotel is near everything; subway, restaurants, shopping.
[0.8718051910400391] The location of the hotel is not too far away from the College Subway station.

[-0.9549636840820312] Several churches of different denominations are dotted around Allan Park that is across the street.
[-0.92559814453125] Got a room without a reservation at the Primrose Hotel which was right beside an underground train stop.
[-0.9253292083740234] Across the street from the old Maple Leaf Gardens, and it looks like a new grocery store is about to open up there soon.
[-0.9252967834472656] And when you are at the park don't forget to visit the Greenhouse.
[-0.8916397094726562] The only thing this place has going for it is the location close to the bars and clubs (which might be a minus if you don't want to risk running into prostitutes on your walk back from dinner).

[0.12007904052734375] The only thing I might mention is the fact that the hotel seems to be located right in the midst of a very prominent gay section of Toronto, and for 7 straight males, some of whom are not particularly tolerant, this could potentially have been problematic.
[0.1195516586303711] It's not in the best part of Toronto but for the price and amenities it was a great value.
