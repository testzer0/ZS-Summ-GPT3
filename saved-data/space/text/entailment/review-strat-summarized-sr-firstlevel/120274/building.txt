[0.9909467697143555] The property though was not nice at all.
[0.8356781005859375] Although this is by no means a luxurious residence, it is a perfect place to stay if you are intending to visit the theme parks, although a car is essential.
[0.7645492553710938] THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.
[0.7557907104492188] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.
[0.7418251037597656] It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!

[0.8395309448242188] A must is a car because travelling around on foot is hard the roads are really hard to cross you take your life into your own hands and wait up to 15 mins for the lights to change and watch the traffic from the right because while your crossing they are too.
[0.7495269775390625] CAR NEEDED, although there is a free shuttle to some parks.

[-0.9987103939056396] I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.
[-0.9985973834991455] The hotel is actually in a good position on the 192 highway, really near to disney & close to lots of good places to eat - red lobster was the best it was just across the road.

[0.8860664367675781] Hotel shop is very expensive so be warned.
[0.6722412109375] The hotel refused to match multiple lower rates I had found elsewhere, so I decided to cancel due to unhelpful reservation services and reserve a hotel I KNOW has superior customer service.
[0.6568984985351562] I think the holiday company are really ripping folk of with what they charge if you get this hotel.
[0.49365234375] And you will want to cancel when you learn there are superior area hotels who match lower advertised rates.
[0.48797607421875] This motel was better than the reviews stated in the last six months, we were pleased with the service, cleanliness, and price.

[-0.9865264892578125] We booked with first choice and this seems to be there most budget hotel.............if you want better you'll have to pay for it i suppose, We wanted a cheap base to enjoy the local attractions but with that we also got a nice comfortable hotel room in a nice quiet area and everything was fineeeeeeeee.
[-0.9860992431640625] Ok, so here goes, the cheap price lured us into staying here, we thought the location was great, but everything else was just horrible.

[0.3436279296875] I would recommend it for anyone who has a hire car as it is quite close to all the major attractions by car but quite difficult to get around without a car.
[0.2210845947265625] The bedding was torn and my feet kept getting caught in the holes.
[0.219757080078125] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
