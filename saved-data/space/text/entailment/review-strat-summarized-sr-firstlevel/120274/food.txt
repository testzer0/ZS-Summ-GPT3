[0.6480140686035156] just got back from 2 weeks at Qi, we just used it as a base to plan our disney wedding, we have stayed at the other 2 Qi's on I drive and this was by far the best, it had everthing you need around i.e dennys, walgreens etc, we could see animal kingdom from hotel so that give you idea of how close to disney, room was clean and cleaned daily, no problem with anyhting apart from what previous guests have said about limited seating for breakfast but no prob as we took it back to room!!
[0.4683494567871094] Breakfast, standard of rooms and pool were all far better than expected - I was very impressed.
[0.43354034423828125] The breakfast was better than other free breakfasts served at other motel like hotels in florida.
[0.34830474853515625] The location couldn't be better and there are lots of restaurants around the hotel.
[0.309600830078125] We were surprised that our room safe was provided at no extra charge, and the continental breakfast provided was satasfactory (although go early to avoid the rush), however if you require a fridge and microwave (which we did expect to be provided as part of the room price) expect to pay $10 a night for the privilege and request at the time of booking.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9953212738037109] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[-0.9898905754089355] Breakfast was terrible, cleaning was very average.
[-0.9874267578125] Like some other reviewers have stated, there are a couple of shortcomings...the "Continental Breakfast" is stale bread, lousy toasters, cereal, coffee and orange juice.
[-0.9849615097045898] I would not recommend this hotel really - it is very basic, so is the breakfast
[-0.9796895980834961] I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!

[0.026988983154296875] I was a bit concerned given some of the comments from other reviewers, however given how much it was costing us (£20 a night) I was pleasantly surprised.
[0.02211761474609375] For the price we paid, what more could you ask for?
[0.01922607421875] (Tell driver to take the Sherbeth Road short cut) Breakfast is fine for a few pieces of toast and orange juice- if you want an all-you-can-eat buffet there's a Sizzler and Ponderosa across the road about 10mins away on foot.
[0.019134521484375] I went down to get some ice and found I needed to return to the room to obtain a quarter... ice was not free.

[-0.9619650840759277] Okay it's a bit tired and basic, but my god it is so cheap!
[-0.9458303451538086] we also brought food in a small cooler bag and saved a lot of money.
[-0.9325151443481445] Cheap hol allocated on arrival, location very good for all parks using the I-4 also if you don't want to drive out to eat, excellent restaraunts opposite hotel (be careful crossing the road) including TGI FRI, Red Lobster, Italian, Subway, Steak House as well as fast foods and Internet cafe.
[-0.9010744094848633] The breakfast was decent - not as good as I've had at other hotels, but it was free so one shouldn't complain :) The location is awesome, about 15 minutes to Disney and almost within walking distance from some nice restaurants.

[-0.8482284545898438] I arrived in this hotel at 2am in the morning,went in to our room and the rooms i booked was not right and there was no kitchen,it stunk of mould,the carpet was dirty,had no wardrobe and no fridge.Went back to reception to complain and the man said there was no room to be moved to and no manager to talk to,i told him we would not be staying here as it is dirty and he offered me another room to look at(after telling me there was no other rooms avaliable),so at 2am we am looking at other rooms after a long journey there.The rooms were no different and we was so tired we said we would have to stay where we was and speak to the manager in the morning.In the morning we looked around the room and realised the sides of our beds were covered in mould,carpet was old,dirty and musty,coffee perculator did not work,a lamp did not work,our door when closed had a gap in it and did not feel safe,so had to take valuables out every day with us.Didnt even attempt to eat in the cafe area.WOULD NOT STAY HERE.DISGUSTING!!!!!
[-0.8470420837402344] I would not recommend this hotel really - it is very basic, so is the breakfast

Parent: The food at the hotel is good, especially the breakfast buffet.

[0.8756179809570312] There are a zillion places to eat along the 192, Ponderosa is great for it's huge buffet breakfast and filling up before a day at the parks.
[0.6732673645019531] The breakfast provided by the hotel was very delicious.
[0.462066650390625] On a better note... the hotel is in a good location and just down the road is a cafe thing where you can get an all you can eat buffet breakfast for very cheap, which served loads of fruit, cakes, a fry up, pretty much anything.
[0.4091033935546875] The breakfast was better than other free breakfasts served at other motel like hotels in florida.

[-0.9965875148773193] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[-0.9881134033203125] Complimentary breakfast was mediocre, I'd rather go to some nearby restaurant's breakfast buffets for $4++/person.
[-0.9877843856811523] Breakfast was terrible, cleaning was very average.
[-0.9874353408813477] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.
[-0.9864027500152588] Breakfast was disappointing but we usually just ate toast to get us going.

[0.9287757873535156] First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.
[0.8956298828125] Other than the small annoyance with the room on checking in and the icemachine, I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.
[0.87359619140625] THE GOOD....Fast Check-in,Close to Disney, Free pool towels, Clean, safe pool, Easy walking distance to restraunts, Free basic breakfast THE BAD....Air-con was loud and slow, paper thin walls, not enough cupboard space, poor decor, small bathroom, no porter, Unreliable and not enough park transfers, Bad smells in room.
[0.8683395385742188] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.

[-0.10292816162109375] I got what I expected for the price and have no complaints with the room.

[0.8195266723632812] The hotel is much the same as every other we have stayed at in Florida before.
[0.7478866577148438] The rooms are your basic hotel rooms - no fancy flat screen TV or dozens of channels - but it's clean and you have an elevator so you don't have to carry your luggage up the stairs.
[0.691131591796875] From previous experience from other hotels they usually only have limited pick ups for the parks.

Parent: However, there are some drawbacks, such as the lack of variety and the need to pay for ice.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6940937042236328] They even charge to get ice for your room, $0.25cents.
[0.5539398193359375] Not much, but you have to bring a quarter to fill your ice-bucket, annoying if you don't know this and have to walk back to your room to find change.
[0.42987060546875] I went down to get some ice and found I needed to return to the room to obtain a quarter... ice was not free.
[0.13470077514648438] We had to pay 25 cent for ice but you can't have every thing.
[0.0774087905883789] The one thing I was a bit 'meh' about; you have to pay for ice.
