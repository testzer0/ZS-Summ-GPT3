[-0.75787353515625] A must is a car because travelling around on foot is hard the roads are really hard to cross you take your life into your own hands and wait up to 15 mins for the lights to change and watch the traffic from the right because while your crossing they are too.

Parent: The hotel shuttle bus was available but not necessary if you had a car.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8824234008789062] We had a car whilst over there but the hotel did have a shuttle bus to the major parks for those that don't drive.
[0.8581695556640625] The Hotel does provide free shuttle buses to Sea world, Universal/Islands of Adventure & to the Epcot Centre (transfer by Monorail at Epcot for the other Disney parks).
[0.7960205078125] Hotel does supply free shuttle buses to all theme parks which go every day and you don't have to bye your tickets from the guest services at the front of the hotel happy holidays.
[0.782623291015625] The hotel offers free shuttle bus to the theme parks also, but the bus departs from the hotel at 8:40a.m.
[0.71051025390625] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.

[0.15891265869140625] Luckily we had a car so did not have to rely on shuttle buses.
[0.1289825439453125] We never used the hotel shuttle bus as we hired a car.
[0.08050537109375] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
[0.0765380859375] Don't take the free shuttle to Disney though as this is the first hotel on the pick up route and you'll spend an hour going round the other hotels picking people up only to drive past this hotel again on the way to Disney!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9680204391479492] there are FREE shuttle rides to the outlets which are very fun to visit.
[-0.9517936706542969] The shuttle service (free) was on time (give or take 10 mins) to the theme parks.
[-0.9500350952148438] was superb and not noisy.
[-0.9431190490722656] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
[-0.9429893493652344] One day, the bus was so overcrowded that i would say it was very dangerous (approx 40 people standing in the centre isle).

[0.9909467697143555] The property though was not nice at all.
[0.8356781005859375] Although this is by no means a luxurious residence, it is a perfect place to stay if you are intending to visit the theme parks, although a car is essential.
[0.7645492553710938] THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.
[0.7557907104492188] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.
[0.7418251037597656] It's not clean or inviting, and the 5 minutes we spent giving it a try lead us straight back to our room for a shower!

[-0.9229621887207031] (toasts and cereals).The location of the Hotel is not too far from theme parks.

[-0.8841609954833984] A hidden treasure of small shops with amusement rides that I didn't even know about ( I only drove by it over a dozen times) and it's mostly free!
