[0.9324817657470703] Great Hotel perfect location, although there was a lot of construction around the hotel.
[0.9204177856445312] Hotel was ideally located for the purpose of my business trip.
[0.9183778762817383] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
[0.914614200592041] Not right in South Beach, but this hotel still has a very good location near the Biscayne Bay with beautiful views!
[0.8814535140991211] This hotel deals with lots of "cruisers" and the location is so convenient next to the port --I could see my ship from my hotel window.

[-0.9830093383789062] One of the downsides to this motel is the location.
[-0.9752883911132812] The Hotel is good - the location is not.
[-0.9725837707519531] I did not like the area the hotel was in i would of prefered south beach area.
[-0.9629287719726562] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[-0.90325927734375] The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace.

[0.7396812438964844] I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
[0.7281875610351562] The front desk guy was nice enough to give us a room facing the bay after we requested it although what they had available was on the 4th floor.
[0.7217864990234375] My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes!

Parent: The location of the hotel is praised by some for its proximity to the ocean, Bayside Plaza, and the Metromover.

----- Supporting -----

[0.39111328125] The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach.
[0.344696044921875] Location is walkable to the Arsht Center, American Airlines Arena, and Bayside, but you would need a taxi/car for anything else.
[0.3126220703125] The hotel is a three minute walk to the Metromover which will take you to Bayside in a couple of minutes where there is nightlife, shops, drinks, and restaurants.
[0.1614990234375] nearby the Bayside arena and a short drive to Miami Beach (art Deco).
[0.156890869140625] When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore.

[-0.6755561828613281] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace
