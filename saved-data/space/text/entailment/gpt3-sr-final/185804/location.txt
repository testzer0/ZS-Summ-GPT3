[0.8118085861206055] The hotel is not far from the Aqua Bus, taxis, and the Granville Island Public Market making it easy to get around.
[0.7368717193603516] This hotel is located close enough to downtown to walk to in 1/2 hour( using the aquabus to cross the channel) but also very close to local interesting sites on granville island and is a 15 min walk to Broadway St and 4th Ave where there are numerous placed to eat.
[0.7178077697753906] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[0.5866775512695312] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.

[-0.8451051712036133] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.29027557373046875] The best part of the hotel is being able to walk to the Public Market where you can find everything you need to prepare a wonderful meal (like a picnic with wine, cheese, bread, fruits, meats, etc) or you could just eat at the many food stalls.
[-0.2820243835449219] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.26573848724365234] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.2194366455078125] The hotel is located as close to the water as you can get without falling in.
