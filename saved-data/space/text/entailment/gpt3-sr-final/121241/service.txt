[-0.9972004890441895] Dog was barking in room across the hall all day and night, one of us stepped in dog feces in the parking lot and tracked it into the room :( A group of ill guests vomited just outside the entry door, massive amounts, when we called to ask that it be cleaned up due to health hazards front desk staff was rude!

[0.1956024169921875] Before I could even get up to answer it a guy was opening our door and very hatefully said " You need to see the front desk about staying another night" I said 'Ok" He said you need to go RIGHT NOW.
