[0.8778343200683594] The staff at the hotel and the parking company (ACE parking) are working hard to rectify the situation, but at $27/night for parking one would hope that her car was more secure than it apparently was.

[0.9052162170410156] This was part of the Starwood Luxury Collection, but having been dissappointed many times before, I did not expect much.
[0.7776374816894531] Their new GM is aware of the service issues they have had and he is working to turn it around.
[0.46319580078125] I know this could happen anywhere but in years of valet parking it hasnt so this was quite annoying.

[0.4739227294921875] Rooms also nice, well-maintained, if again trying a bit too hard - one almost feels like this hotel is screaming "yes, I know its Dallas, but Dallas can be trendy too!".
[0.3198661804199219] Their new GM is aware of the service issues they have had and he is working to turn it around.
[0.23287582397460938] the romance package is worth the upgrade because it includes champagne, valet parking, chocolates and breakfast, and they even cover the bed with rose petals if/when you leave the room after check-in.
[0.19497299194335938] I took it with astonishment.. if ice is all the guests want from this hotel it says it all about the culture this hotel is trying to achieve.
