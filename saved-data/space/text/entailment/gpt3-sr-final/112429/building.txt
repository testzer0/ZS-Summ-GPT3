[0.9722518920898438] There's a lot of construction going on around the hotel so make sure you get a room that is high up and that does not overlook the construction site (ask for a room overlooking Pine St) and you'll be fine.
[0.9469165802001953] The location is great (ten minute walk from Pike Place Market) but construction in and around the area means you're forced to use valet parking ($25/night).
[0.938206672668457] Tons of construction in the neighborhood which starts at 6:30 am.
[0.9374914169311523] Located in an area where there is massive construction.
[0.9371490478515625] The only thing was that there was construction going on right across the street that woke us up before 9am on a Monday morning.

[0.44116783142089844] When we returned to the hotel and the Cafe, it was obvious that it was a popular spot for locals and hotel guests alike.

[-0.9485816955566406] Things started to go terribly wrong on our second night.
[-0.9474029541015625] Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge.

[-0.8461074829101562] Very annoying.
