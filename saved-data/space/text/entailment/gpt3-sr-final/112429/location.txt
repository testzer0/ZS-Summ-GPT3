[0.8453636169433594] Laid back, nonintrusive hotel suitable for business or vacation stays, centrally located on Pine--3 blocks from Westlake, a block from the bus terminal ($2.75 airport transfers), and a block from Von's Martini and Manhattan Shrine, never to be missed.
[0.8067226409912109] The location is very good, in the thick of shopping and restaurants, halfway between Pike St. Market and Capitol Hill.

[-0.9948816299438477] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.9236717224121094] On this last stay, I was assigned a corner room which had great views but, because of having two windows and being on the corner of a busy street, was also a bit noisier (sirens, etc.)
[-0.9230575561523438] I had a corner room and the view was exceptional.
[-0.8616847991943359] This is a small place and they react quickly.
[-0.8476715087890625] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !

[-0.9901161193847656] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.9295940399169922] I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.
[-0.8051681518554688] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.7850265502929688] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.
[-0.7673797607421875] Valet parking was terrible.
