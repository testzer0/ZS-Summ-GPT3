[0.989079475402832] The meal was pricey, but well worth it.
[0.9380893707275391] There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.
[0.9201812744140625] (see photo) The breakfast buffet was a little expensive but the food and service were both very good.
[0.9049568176269531] I can't comment on the food or drinks offered at the hotel as we did not order anything at the restaurant or room service - it was pretty expensive.
[0.8510208129882812] The pool area is quite small, and elevators, lobby is packed by noon, and there seem to be a lot of kids running around everytime im there, and the giftshop and cafe were very overpriced.

[-0.9910106658935547] The restaurant was very good and reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant.
[-0.9244842529296875] (1) Location of the hotel is ideal , my wife was thrilled as it was within short walling distance to the Eaton center one of the largest shopping centers in Toronto (2) Room is spacious compared to other 4 star hotels, good furniture, clean and neat (3) Good entertainment with LCD 37 inch TV with on demand movies and more (4) Staff are friendly and professional, good staffing numbers very adequate (5) Breakfast was great and included in the price of around US$ 200 per night , very fair price for this hotel, the breakfast included fresh fruits (Produce of Canada) and eggs and an egg station and many other delights
[-0.88824462890625] Room service was not over-priced and it took about half an hour for our dinner to arrive on the Saturday evening, when we were too lazy to venture out for a meal.
[-0.8452301025390625] A very friendly owner and you can get three eggs, two toasts, bacon and coffee for $3.99, so we became regulars for four days.
[-0.8151168823242188] Expensive parking.

[0.9138107299804688] The food quality in the restaurant was very good.
[0.7807292938232422] We had breakfast and lunch at the Parkside restaurant in the hotel, the food was of a very high standard, and children less than three eat free ( it costs $7.95 for children over three for the breakfast buffet).
[0.6574773788452148] It was neat and clean.
[0.5719985961914062] The room itself was up to Marriott's usual standards - well done, not over-the-top luxurious, but very nice.

[-0.9730377197265625] Poor QC here.
[-0.96856689453125] Not good value.
[-0.9589576721191406] However, we were very dissapointed when we checked in to find that our sheets had stains on them and looked worn.
[-0.9539031982421875] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.

[0.4962158203125] I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.
[0.4725341796875] When my husband's Cesar salad was served with chicken instead of salmon, he had to hunt down the waiter to point out the problem, and the waiter barely seemed to care.
