[-0.9923772811889648] My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.
[-0.9908180236816406] The rest of the hotel was nice but a little dated.
[-0.9842643737792969] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.
[-0.94879150390625] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.
[-0.9353275299072266] It's a nice clean, quiet hotel in a great area.

[0.8235063552856445] The lobby is very appealing and the front desk staff were professional and polite.
[0.8028602600097656] We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.

[-0.9414005279541016] The room was a standard hotel room, nothing special or unique.
[-0.9316864013671875] My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.
[-0.9221553802490234] It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.
[-0.8977546691894531] This hotel was okay, nothing special.
[-0.8813934326171875] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[-0.7793731689453125] The shower however was very touchy and the water was either scalding hot or very cold.
[-0.7331695556640625] Hot Tub was good.
[-0.529266357421875] It's amazing how not being able to have a normal shower can affect my overall impression but it does.
[-0.52325439453125] They even have a juicer with prepared vegetables that you can juice, cold deli meats and cheeses, omelet station, typical hot foods section, compotes,oatmeals, breads, etc.
[-0.5228424072265625] And I agree with previous posters, they need new cable service for the TV.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.994354248046875] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[-0.9937634468078613] Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff.
[-0.9930515289306641] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.9908261299133301] other issues- bathroom really not that nice, concierge horrible at recommending things to do or good resutarants or giving directions.
[-0.9518003463745117] We are NOT demanding restaurant a patrons, but both the food and the service was poor.

[0.9730319976806641] The fire alarm went off.
Parent: There were some complaints about the fire alarm going off, but overall the reviews were positive.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9730319976806641] Everything was as expected, good check in, great location, nice room, good staff, etc....then about 11:00pm the fire alarms went off.
[0.9698295593261719] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[0.8482818603515625] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!
[0.517669677734375] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!
[0.267333984375] Had some idiot pull fire alarm at 4 am on Sunday, but was resolved within 30 minutes and not having to evacuate.

[-0.967498779296875] Breakfast arrived right on time and was delicious (scrambled egs, well done bacon, juice and tea...perfect!).

[0.609710693359375] I don't agree with the majority of the rave reviews for this hotel.
[0.5941963195800781] I stayed at the hotel with my family of 4 and my mother last weekend and we were really pleased with the hotel.
[0.5660438537597656] The decor was tasteful, flat-screen tv, VERY soft King bed, marble counter in the bathroom...we were quite impressed.
[0.5510177612304688] However, we found this hotel to be pleasant and clean.

[-0.991999626159668] We are NOT demanding restaurant a patrons, but both the food and the service was poor.
[-0.9897480010986328] However, we were very dissapointed when we checked in to find that our sheets had stains on them and looked worn.
[-0.988060474395752] It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.
[-0.986907958984375] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
