[-0.9932155609130859] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.
[-0.9843368530273438] My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.
[-0.9732551574707031] We called reception at 3am to get them changed, they were apologetic and changed them immediately but even the 'new' sheets still had holes and looked worn!
[-0.969202995300293] The worst part of the stay however was finding two LARGE insects or animals, something in the room!
[-0.9680042266845703] I was on the 10th floor, it took forever for the shower to get hot and when it did the temperature fluctuated radically from luke warm to scalding.
