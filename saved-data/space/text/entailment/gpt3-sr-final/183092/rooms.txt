[0.4621105194091797] I recently stayed at Marriott Eaton Center and had a wonderful stay.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8546237945556641] Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy!
[-0.8487653732299805] During our recent trip we stayed in 5 hotels in Canada and this was by far the worst.
[-0.7933692932128906] It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in.
[-0.7701797485351562] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.
[-0.7416152954101562] Great service, friendly staff, good food - pity the room wiater couldn't go further than the threshold !!!!
