[0.5006103515625] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.406585693359375] Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.
[0.3370361328125] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
[0.289886474609375] we were so tired and sore from bad sleep we went home early on monday without shopping or anything the room was kind of plain we had the room with a jacuzzi and fireplace but both nights when we were in bed sleeping the jacuzzi mysteriously turned on and woke us both up and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off.
[0.289581298828125] This night was a bit of a mess; we would walk out to the hallway and smell weed, hear loud music blasting, etc.
