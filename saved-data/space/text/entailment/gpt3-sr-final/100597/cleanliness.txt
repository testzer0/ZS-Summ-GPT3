[0.463958740234375] The room was a bit basic and dated but it was inexpensive and we could leave our car in their car park while we were on holiday.
[0.4594879150390625] My room was clean and nice but seemed motel like away from the tower.
[0.4282073974609375] The room was like staying in a basement, an old and mildew smell.
[0.379241943359375] They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin.
[0.3088836669921875] It's obviously clean, although the further you get into the maze of halls the more the funky smell of "old" permeates the air.
