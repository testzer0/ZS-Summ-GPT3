[0.5127639770507812] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
[0.2587909698486328] Lobby seemed nice, there's a restaurant right off the lobby that is also very nice and the Tim Horton's attached to the hotel is a great perk for me (I need my Tim's coffee in the AM!).
[0.16461658477783203] The service was great and we had a breakfast arranged in a private dining room which everyone enjoyed.
[0.16196823120117188] 2) Our favorite bottle of wine is waiting for us in the room 3) Reservations are made at our favorite restauraunt 4) Staff know us by our first names 5) My wife gets a birthday email on her birthday 6) The staff truly feels like family TRY THIS hOTEL you wont be disapointed!
[0.15587997436523438] Had daily continental or hot breakfast for an unreasonable cost for the 'menu' - try the local restaurants or delivery) Overall, reasonable cost for duration; comfortable, quiet, clean rooms; and you receive Best Western Club points or Airmiles for your stay.

[0.267791748046875] What is it with $20 hotel breakfasts in Toronto?
[0.167938232421875] They were also kind enough to recommend and make reservations at a lovely restaurant called Ruth Chris (pricey but well worth it if you are a steak lover).
[0.1102447509765625] The restaurant was also a great deal since our kids ate free from the buffet since they are younger.
[0.039642333984375] And just like my stay out at the airport, I made the mistake of not paying attention to the breakfast prices before I started ordering.

[0.4697265625] Oh I must also add that there is a Tim Horton's donut shop, second only to Dunkin Donuts in quality (although Canadians might argue that point), located right inside the front entrance, so that was a great option for breakfast!
[0.4279289245605469] Loved the Tim Hortons in the Lobby the next morning.

[-0.6771888732910156] I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump.
