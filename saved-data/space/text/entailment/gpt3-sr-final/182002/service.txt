[-0.8300666809082031] Went to Toronto for a buyers show and stayed at this Primrose Hotel because there was a dinner function there for us.Â  Booked on bestwestern.com as I found the rate was pretty much the same on all the websites I checked.Â  Lobby was ok, nothing too fancy.Â  I was checked in by the manager who seemed very nice and told me he upgraded my room - thanks!Â  Room was HUGE!Â  Great view of the city, very comfortable bed, I slept well.Â  Bathroom was ok, kinda like the lobby.Â  All the staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet was good but overpriced compared to the Golden Greek restaurant next door that I found on my next morning.Â  For the price I paid I would stay again.
[-0.6815986633300781] The hotel staff were very courteous and even asked if we needed a smoking or a non smoking room and a room with two double beds or one.
[-0.676727294921875] All the staff I encountered were friendly and couldn't have been more helpful, which I found very reassuring as a lone female traveller on her first trip to Canada.
[-0.6507492065429688] However the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the grand piano in the lobby was attractive but never played!
[-0.6235122680664062] The ladies at the reception desk were very pleasant and always smiling and very helpful in giving us directions.
