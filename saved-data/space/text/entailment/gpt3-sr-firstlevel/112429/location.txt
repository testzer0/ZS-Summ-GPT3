[0.9541492462158203] The pros: - Convenient the location, walking distance to Pike Place Market (8 short blocks) and Bell Town.
[0.9462413787841797] The hotel is conveniently located, has a helpful and friendly staff, and is within walking distance to PPM, Capitol Hill, Belltown, and the Space Needle.

[-0.9901161193847656] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.9295940399169922] I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.
[-0.8051681518554688] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.7850265502929688] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.
[-0.7673797607421875] Valet parking was terrible.
