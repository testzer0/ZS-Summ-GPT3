[0.9238681793212891] Hotel is new, everything was in good working order.
[0.9204654693603516] A fairly small hotel for Toronto but modern (it is a pretty new property) and very, very clean.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9010944366455078] Our original two rooms were finally clean but had already been given to someone else.
[-0.8232955932617188] The room itself and the hotel were very nicely decorated, combining old and new accents.
[-0.7935314178466797] The room was a fairly typical Hilton Garden Inn room, which I like, with great & free high speed access, a fridge that came in very handy and a solid shower and bed.
[-0.6277618408203125] The week-end floozies everywhere and drunken partners are too much !
[-0.6245479583740234] Excellent hotel that hides into an average gray downtown building, standing on an average not important street.

[0.9622325897216797] The lobby is lovely.
Parent: The building is new and has a lovely lobby.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9622325897216797] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[0.8359546661376953] Nice lobby with fresh cookies in the evening.

[0.2369842529296875] The rooms are beautiful and spacious.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9148139953613281] Hotel rooms and restaurant = great "Valet" = brutal and ruined the whole stay.
[-0.9038810729980469] I truly disliked the bed.
[-0.8998203277587891] That was a bit of a pain, but understandable, because it was getting extremely rowdy and it was clear people were bringing in about 10 people into one room.
[-0.8882617950439453] This night was a bit of a mess; we would walk out to the hallway and smell weed, hear loud music blasting, etc.
[-0.8789176940917969] I would NOT recommend giving this hotel your business.

**********

[0.9544010162353516] However, the walls are thin.
Parent: However, the walls are thin and the parking is expensive.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9544010162353516] (once we figured out how to work all the shower heads) The walls were very thin though-we could really hear our neighbours mini party at 2AM in the morning.
[0.841644287109375] There was a little noise in the adjacent rooms, walls are paper-thin as in most hotels.
[0.049468994140625] In the bathroom you feel like you are in a space capsule and these are a little cramped but lets face it how much time do you spend in a bathroom...in and out right!
[0.03778076171875] So, I can recommend the hotel, but please stay on the side where, hopefully, the base beat can't get you.
[0.01361083984375] All in all, a nice place, but I would only stay there if they could assure me that I would not be on that side of the building!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.5728073120117188] Also, tons of bars everywhere!!!
[-0.232391357421875] Free wi-fi!
[-0.217742919921875] For a price of $10 we had a choice of hot and cold items, both ready made, and made to order.
[-0.19647216796875] The wallpaper in the bathroom and our room was warped, bubbled, etc.
[-0.193756103515625] Eggs are cooked to order and are really good.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9596376419067383] The lobby is quite lovely, the parking is expensive.
[0.9362821578979492] Parking rates are high as you will find in all major cities around the world.
[0.9063491821289062] Valet parking was expensive, but this is expected in a city like Toronto with limited downtown space.
[0.8559036254882812] It was worth the cost of the parking just to have their assistance.
[0.8418617248535156] Also, if you are planning on parking your car there is only valet parking available which at $35 per day is quite pricey.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8164825439453125] For a price of $10 we had a choice of hot and cold items, both ready made, and made to order.
[-0.7710113525390625] Great rates, Great location, friendly staff.
[-0.7451171875] I truly disliked the bed.
[-0.7330169677734375] There are lots of parking lots near by that look cheaper than the hotel valet system (one right across the road).
[-0.7127723693847656] It was so inexpensive for the area and amenities.

[0.7774620056152344] There are some issues with the fire alarm.
Parent: There have been some issues with the fire alarm going off.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7774620056152344] The only bad things that i can mention are that during my stay another guest decided to set the fire alarm of at 04:30, not a wake up call I want to repeat.
[0.5314044952392578] I was there the morning of the false fire alarm and although it was annoying I would rather it be false than for real!
[0.4487171173095703] The fire alarm went off in the ENTIRE hotel very early in the morning because someone burned toast.
[0.09273910522460938] Sixth, we were told over the phone that we could get a roll out bed (cot) for free, when we arrived we were informed that to add a roll out bed would be a fire hazard.
[0.063751220703125] Plus the spa had too much chlorine in and that my eye's were stinging.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7154464721679688] And they did seem to have some issues with their parking being full; several people were being directed to other parking garages, etc.
[-0.17745399475097656] Couldn't find any faults with this hotel.
[-0.1697845458984375] Free wi-fi!
[-0.16265869140625] The palaver with the change in the restaurant was the only niggle and although it was a little comical, I can imagine it would become very irritating if it happened more than once.
[-0.1593017578125] Only other thing to note would be that the jacuzzi jets randomly turned on a couple of times but it was never when we were sleeping so not a big deal.

[0.004741668701171875] This is where the weekend turns for the worse....
[0.002239227294921875] We asked to be assigned to a room far away from the elevator so we do not have to hear it all night long.
[0.0] Horrible !
