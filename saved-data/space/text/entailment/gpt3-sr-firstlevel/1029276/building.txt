[0.1397724151611328] I'd suggest Hilton put a few dollars into a rehab.

[0.5714931488037109] The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel.

Parent: There are also issues with the elevators taking a long time to arrive, and the fire station being located nearby.

[0.4474525451660156] Due to on-site construction, elevator service was horrible.
[0.43961334228515625] The elevator dinged all night long keeping up the entire family.
[0.2861785888671875] Because you will complain that the elevators are slow....that the elevators are warm....It will always be something and frankly you would complain if you were given the room for free.
[0.08700942993164062] We were near the lifts and they were noisy all night.
[0.0799560546875] Of course the downside was that the elevators were slow, depending on what time of the day it was ..but the way people complain on here, you would think it was the end of the world.
