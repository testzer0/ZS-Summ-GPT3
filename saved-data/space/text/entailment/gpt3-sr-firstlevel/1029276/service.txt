Parent: Additionally, some guests were charged for wireless internet access in their rooms.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9576950073242188] Second, my husband and I are both businesspeople, and to get wireless internet in our room, we were EACH charged $9.99 a day, even though their materials all say "wireless internet in your room for only $9.99 a day."
[0.9471664428710938] Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business.
[0.881622314453125] Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all.
[0.8391876220703125] Free wifi only at the lobby and not in room.
[0.7473907470703125] Wireless internet access is $9.95 which isn't bad by most comparisons.

[-0.9173583984375] I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet.
[-0.90203857421875] Another positive was the free internet service in the lobby (they had 3 computers you could use as well as wireless if you had a laptop) We were also able to avoid paying the $28 parking fee by parking across the street at a meter and then making sure we moved our car in the morning.
[-0.8410797119140625] Good amenities without a lot of nickel-and-diming, eg, free high-speed Internet with 5 or 6 terminals and connected printers.
[-0.802490234375] The executive lounge had new Dell computers, wifi internet access was available throughout the hotel (including the pool area) -- free for gold and diamond members.
[-0.800323486328125] As a Hilton gold member, had access to the lounge, and free internet in room.

[0.5450515747070312] Don't really need this on holiday especially when you have been out really early say on an excursion and you return late afternoon/early evening to find room not cleaned or replenished.
[0.3594970703125] The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton.
[0.22246551513671875] Our room could have been better, candy wrappers in the dresser drawers and a pair on men's underwear crumpled up by the picture window.
[0.2159423828125] The first night our food orders took forever and tonight I never got my slice of pie and our second round of drinks never arrived.
[0.2001953125] Breakfast was cold, room service was OK. As I'm writing this review, we've been without water - the entire hotel - for more than 3 hours.
