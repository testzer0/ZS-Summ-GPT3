Parent: The reviews were positive, stating that the rooms were clean, comfortable, and spacious.

----- Supporting -----

[0.5516891479492188] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
[0.48688507080078125] We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied.
[0.4755363464355469] We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac.
[0.4376983642578125] Despite the low rate, the receptionist tried to give us the type of room I wanted (high floor, one bed) and was very pleasant to me.
[0.42945098876953125] Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9960727691650391] I'm surprised at the negative reviews, I'm a regular Priceline customer, staying at the Doubletree usually once a month and have never had a bad experience.
[-0.994720458984375] The shuttle was hot and smelly again and people were mad.
[-0.9879288673400879] What I found was rather run down and shabby.
[-0.9835071563720703] Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland.
[-0.97930908203125] To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.

[0.8559436798095703] I asked for a room in the tower and the room was spacious with a nice king bed and a balcony that overlooked the airport.
[0.8074474334716797] Upgrade to King Corner Room or Penthouse to really treat yourself, balcony are amazing in these rooms.
[0.7821235656738281] The pool area, lobby and view from the balcony were very nice, not what I normally find when traveling and especially not this close to the airport!
[0.7554512023925781] There was a huge wrap around balcony with a view of the glass elavators and a view of the Cascade Mts.

[0.462158203125] The hotel's extended parking option provides great value.
[0.44183349609375] The DoubleTree was convenient to the airport, even though we were part of group travel, the DoubleTree had an airport shuttle.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9494609832763672] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
[-0.944758415222168] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
[-0.9364738464355469] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[-0.9146060943603516] The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare.
[-0.910888671875] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.

[0.5865249633789062] Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.
[0.5789070129394531] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.

[0.8352470397949219] The only issue we had was the size of the hotel with various wings that were difficult to navigate.
[0.759796142578125] Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.

[0.8631935119628906] My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting.

[-0.9780120849609375] The bathroom was dirty and stained.

[-0.9288253784179688] Bathroom floors seems dirty and needed to be regrouted.
[-0.901275634765625] But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected.

[-0.79608154296875] The tower rooms do have balconies but the space is shared with the room next door and divided by a set of austere looking bars--plus there is no furniture to sit on so the balconies are not really functional.
