[0.9581165313720703] For an airport hotel, it was surprisingly quiet, rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared, and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous.
[0.946563720703125] My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9241628646850586] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
[-0.8963279724121094] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9464530944824219] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[0.9318923950195312] The internet fees are a HUGE scam-- $12-$15 for 24 hours.
[0.9254150390625] My only complaint is that they charge for the use of wifi in your room.

[0.9675159454345703] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[0.9577045440673828] I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car.
[0.9479827880859375] Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night.
[0.9249343872070312] Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.

[-0.9961166381835938] The bathroom was dirty and stained.
[-0.9956140518188477] Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.
[-0.9955978393554688] Room was highly run down.
[-0.9950838088989258] When we found our room we discovered that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and there were dirty towels lying around.
[-0.9947328567504883] Wall paper peeling off walls in different places, light bulb not replaced in room and carpet stained.

[-0.9966268539428711] The front desk staff were grouchy, uninterested and not pleasant to deal with.
[-0.9922947883605957] We experienced this poor attitude with a few other staff members within the hotel.
[-0.9697856903076172] When we were there, there were a bunch of real estate agents who were getting a bit rowdy.
[-0.8739967346191406] No facilities were open early next morning when we were headed for our flight (surprising in such a location where there were lots of people headed for early flights) and although there seem to be a lot of valet staff around, none of them made any effort to assist.
[-0.8393745422363281] I took a taxi as everyone was trying to cram into the shuttle with no respect for first-come-first-served.

[0.7710895538330078] The hotel shuttle was convenient.
Parent: The hotel shuttle was also praised for its convenience.

[-0.9494609832763672] It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again.
[-0.944758415222168] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
[-0.9364738464355469] But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in.
[-0.9146060943603516] The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare.
[-0.910888671875] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
