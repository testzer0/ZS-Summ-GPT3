[0.16015625] However, we really wanted a room on the 2nd floor with a view over False creek, so changed on night 2.
[0.053436279296875] Suite was amazing with views over the false creek harbour and city skyline.
[0.048675537109375] Our girls loved the decent-sized hot tube with the windowed ceiling that allowed us to watch the starts at night.

[-0.9359664916992188] The restaurant has a fabulous view of the harbour which we enjoyed both mornings for breakfast.

[0.14267539978027344] It's in a perfect location, it's been recently updated, it's very clean, it has a lovely patio to enjoy the views from, it's located on Granville Island with it's many charming spots to shop, dine and enjoy the fabulous farmers market, it really couldn't be better.
[0.0548553466796875] They also have pet friendly rooms with tiled floors.
[0.0501251220703125] The marble tile floors in the rooms make for easy management of the pet-friendly policy, so I don't mark this hotel down for that as some other reviewers have mentioned.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9388656616210938] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[-0.9157800674438477] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.

[0.6860809326171875] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[0.179901123046875] Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc.
[0.1554718017578125] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[0.06960296630859375] I'd have given it 5 stars if only the desk chair hadn't had arms and been a royal pain to move around.

[0.03106689453125] quiet at night without the often ugly street level scene you encounter at more glamorous high-rises (yes the high-rises can give you great views but coming out at street level you feel like you've walked into a seedy bus station environment).
[0.029821395874023438] We finally settled on a penthouse suite here and absolutely could not have been more pleased.
[0.02185821533203125] Got room twice the sz with a balcony & view - MUCH better :-) This is close to everything,GR8 4 kids, couples, walking, hopping, coffee, food, farmer's market, easy acess to bridges, residential, ferries across water to downtown, yaletown, science world.
