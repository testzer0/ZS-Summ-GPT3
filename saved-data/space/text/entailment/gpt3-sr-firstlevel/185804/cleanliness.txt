----- Weakening -----

[-0.9911985397338867] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.
[-0.9891147613525391] The room also had a weird smell.
[-0.9868545532226562] It is a mash up of 80s smoked glass and more recent upgrades and pseudo renovations.
[-0.98681640625] * The doors, wallpaper and carpets need to be redone.
[-0.9860458374023438] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).

[-0.9761838912963867] I rented a bike but no one offered to show me how to use the lock.
[-0.8869094848632812] However, if problems arise, as they did on our night, do not expect the manage to be of any help.
[-0.88134765625] The desk staff would not look up on Hotels.ca the discrepancies we sited when checking out but they were very cheery and smiling the whole time while denying our information which was infuriating!
[-0.8101930618286133] The staff just seemed disinterested, especially at the bar and the front desk.
[-0.7672042846679688] The temperature control ( an old round dial type of thermostat) didnt work so we couldnt adjust the temperature, other then by opening a window.

[0.9866738319396973] The lighting in the room was not good.
Parent: The only issue was with the lighting in the room.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9866738319396973] And the most annoying: the room lighting is poor, in particular the reading light.
[0.6013984680175781] There actually isn't any; the bedside lamp is too dim to read by.
[0.4147796630859375] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!
[0.24097061157226562] The room was small and dark and old.
[0.1353759765625] I wish that there were a way to turn off the outside lights, however, so that I could leave the curtains open at night to catch the lights from the buildings across False Creek.

[0.8809051513671875] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.

[0.7121849060058594] The hotel's furnishings are outdated.
Parent: The hotel is clean, but the furnishings are a little dated.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7121849060058594] The rooms are fairly well equipped, and on the surface look good, however the fittings when you look closely at them are not top quality, and will not last.
[0.5203514099121094] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[0.38080596923828125] Its a bit old and some of the furnishings and fabrics in the room showed their age, but its clean and quiet and the mattress was comfortable.
[0.34612274169921875] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[0.19392776489257812] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9945492744445801] It's in a perfect location, it's been recently updated, it's very clean, it has a lovely patio to enjoy the views from, it's located on Granville Island with it's many charming spots to shop, dine and enjoy the fabulous farmers market, it really couldn't be better.
