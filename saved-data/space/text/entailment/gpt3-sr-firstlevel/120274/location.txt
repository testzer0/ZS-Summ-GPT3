[0.7682647705078125] (Tell driver to take the Sherbeth Road short cut) Breakfast is fine for a few pieces of toast and orange juice- if you want an all-you-can-eat buffet there's a Sizzler and Ponderosa across the road about 10mins away on foot.
[0.7096920013427734] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
[0.5755081176757812] The breakfast is served in the lobby area and there are limited tables but you could always eat it in your room or if you don't like what's on offer there are numerous buffet restaurants nearby serving food at prices to suit all pockets.

[-0.9972805976867676] We booked with first choice and this seems to be there most budget hotel.............if you want better you'll have to pay for it i suppose, We wanted a cheap base to enjoy the local attractions but with that we also got a nice comfortable hotel room in a nice quiet area and everything was fineeeeeeeee.
[-0.9971764087677002] It was very quiet at night and we all slept peacefully on the comfortable beds.

[0.9164009094238281] BUT personally i always stay clear of international drive as i find it quite run down and too busy............if you enjoy the 192 area of kissimee then this hotel is fine!
[0.846710205078125] The rooms and hotel are a bit tired and in need of a reno.
[0.8211517333984375] This is the 3rd time my family have stayed in this hotel & yes it does need a revamp & is a bit worn & tired but the staff are friendly & provide a good service.
[0.732421875] THE VERDICT...Very basic..This hotel needs to be knocked down and rebuilt...if your looking for a low cost quality hotel dont stay here.
[0.67584228515625] We were given a room at the back of the hotel, which was a little beat up (chipped furniture, door paint) but very clean and had a new carpet, tub, mattresses etc.

[0.9619922637939453] Firstly we could not find the hotel, we needed to go a bit further down on the 192 than we were doing but when we finally got we got checked in very quickly, be warned the reception staff are very rude and unhelpful!!
[0.8226776123046875] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.
[0.7751312255859375] Firstly, reception won't really care as we found them quite surely and unhelpful, and secondly the rooms are not gleaming and smelling of rose petals!
[0.585968017578125] The hotel refused to match multiple lower rates I had found elsewhere, so I decided to cancel due to unhelpful reservation services and reserve a hotel I KNOW has superior customer service.
[0.5420913696289062] This hotel has a serious bed bug problem and they are not willing to take care of the issue.
