[0.9311065673828125] Give it a miss though if you are a hygiene freak, or if you expect to spend time at poolside or hanging out in the hotel!
[0.348388671875] We would stay here again, if you want more luxury it is not for you, if you want a clean safe place and conveniently located for parks then its perfect!
[0.33380126953125] However if the slightest sign of dirt or grime gives you cause to reach for the phone and call reception, I would pass on this hotel for 2 reasons.
[0.33251953125] If you are expecting a European style hotel you will be disappointed.
