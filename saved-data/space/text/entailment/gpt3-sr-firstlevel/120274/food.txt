[0.8675460815429688] I would not recommend this hotel really - it is very basic, so is the breakfast
[0.33770751953125] the rooms are ok the service is ok the breakfast is ok.
[0.297576904296875] Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative.
[0.28656005859375] Complimentary breakfast was mediocre, I'd rather go to some nearby restaurant's breakfast buffets for $4++/person.
[0.2578125] Take my advise and eat the hotels simple continental breakfast and save yourself a headache :) The hotel was overall GOOD with friendly staff...

[0.6475315093994141] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[0.4942054748535156] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.
