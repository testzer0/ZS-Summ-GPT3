[0.9546780586242676] The rooms were large and nicely appointed.
[0.7475624084472656] We had connecting rooms, these were prepared to a very high standard, house keeping do a first class job in this hotel.
[0.7251453399658203] The decor was tasteful, flat-screen tv, VERY soft King bed, marble counter in the bathroom...we were quite impressed.
[0.5848236083984375] The room itself was up to Marriott's usual standards - well done, not over-the-top luxurious, but very nice.
[0.45342254638671875] We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9897193908691406] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.

[0.6311798095703125] There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.
[0.6054286956787109] The pool area is quite small, and elevators, lobby is packed by noon, and there seem to be a lot of kids running around everytime im there, and the giftshop and cafe were very overpriced.

[-0.9858169555664062] Room service was not over-priced and it took about half an hour for our dinner to arrive on the Saturday evening, when we were too lazy to venture out for a meal.
