[0.9049186706542969] Rooms were nice in decor but there was dirt under the beds, TV was tiny, wireless internet was horrible, room was very small, pool and hot tub were tiny and full of rowdy kids with no one enforcing the rules of no jumping or horseplay, could not enjoy it at all.
[0.048370361328125] They did not give one person a packet, the Front Desk staff was downright snarky, as if I was asking them to do to much.
[0.030324935913085938] The wireless internet did not work and we were basically told - "Sorry" and they couldn't do anything about it.
[0.0291900634765625] We never did get our computer on the wireless network even after taking our laptop to the front desk.
[0.016571044921875] We would never go back to this property again, because of the condition of the property, and the bad oders.

[0.1724853515625] The indoor pool/jacuzzi could really use some updating, ventilation, and bigger towels, but water was clean.
[0.151123046875] The smallness was accentuated by the large armoire, which made the room seem even smaller.
[0.13958740234375] You could barely walk between the armoire and the bed.
[0.026620864868164062] This place was just great - perfect for smaller kids.
