[0.969853401184082] The hotel is very good, with decent sized rooms, great prices and excellent service!
[0.9219188690185547] Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
[0.637603759765625] I'm almost reluctant to write this review, because I don't want prices at this great little hotel to go up.
[0.5138626098632812] I travel a lot for business and I always look forward to staying at the Granville because I always get what I expect which is good value for the money and a very nice stay.
[0.3694000244140625] We booked this hotel primarily because of its location, value, and it is close to downtown.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9794578552246094] We stayed in 6 hotels in all and this was by no means the cheapest, but it was the least appealing.
[-0.9679336547851562] It was an acceptable hotel, but definitely not worth the outlandish price.
[-0.9082183837890625] The hotel itself is reasonably priced, has very open meeting rooms with doors directly outside.
[-0.9034576416015625] This is not a five star hotel but you are not paying five star prices and as stated above the location is awesome.
[-0.8556652069091797] In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.

[0.9806356430053711] The public spaces were nicely decorated.
Parent: Public spaces were nicely decorated, but one room had a couple of sad prints on the walls.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9806356430053711] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.7902297973632812] The rooms were well appointed.
[0.6856689453125] All the rooms have been remodeled with nice big screen TVs, very comfortable beds and nice d√©cor.
[0.6426153182983398] It was huge, comfortable ,clean, nicely decorated and with great views over the boats of False Creek.
[0.5436763763427734] It had views of the harbour and the rooms were absolutely beautiful -- nice marble floors too.

[-0.9907913208007812] The rooms are small and sparsely furnished.
[-0.9619693756103516] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.9212512969970703] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.8951892852783203] The room was small and dark and old.

[0.6401748657226562] Those small issues aside, this is a lovely hotel in a great area, close to the attractions of Vancouver yet far enough away to provide solace.
[0.6357765197753906] I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, Alexandra MceKenzie, Sales & Catering Coordinator and all the staff to anyone looking to plan a magical event in a most beautiful setting.

[0.9538307189941406] Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market.
[0.7941989898681641] The best part of the hotel is being able to walk to the Public Market where you can find everything you need to prepare a wonderful meal (like a picnic with wine, cheese, bread, fruits, meats, etc) or you could just eat at the many food stalls.
[0.7872142791748047] The biggest obivious attraction of this hotel is its location - smack dab in the middle of Granville Island, and therefore close to the restaurants, markets, shops, and galleries that are all nearby.
[0.7317314147949219] This is a fantastic site to walk around, have a bike ride, visit the ocean, go shopping, go on a small bot tour, its all available next to the Granville Island Hotel.
[0.7247066497802734] The Granville Island Hotel is a great little place to stay if you don't want the big city experience, and you like walking out your door to the marketplace, coffee shops, galleries and outdoor spaces that surround you on this interesting island.

[-0.45871543884277344] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.3761787414550781] I would not recommend this to my friends or family.
