Parent: The reviews said that the location was great with lovely views, close to attractions but far enough away to provide peace, and with lots of shopping and great food options.

[0.982757568359375] The location was perfect.
[0.969886302947998] The location is just perfect.
[0.9672765731811523] The location is great, the waitstaff good and the food ok.
[0.9660701751708984] The location is amazing, Granville Island is a tourist hotspot, filled with art galleries and a indoors farmers market which is a must see and great place for lunch.
[0.9659614562988281] This is not a five star hotel but you are not paying five star prices and as stated above the location is awesome.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9937915802001953] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.9789533615112305] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
[-0.8787574768066406] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.8098945617675781] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.8051605224609375] The only reason I did not give it 5 out of 5 stars is because of its location.

[0.9833645820617676] The area is amazing with lots of shopping, great food and beautiful views!
[0.9671134948730469] The Dockside Restaurant has a beautiful view of the waterfront and the ambiance was warm and contemporary.
[0.9564700126647949] It was all lovely, beautiful venue with the patio and city and water view, delicious food, all the guests and a great time!
[0.9564590454101562] Overlooking a marina and with fine views over Vancouver it really is ideally situated.
[0.947850227355957] The hotel provides some wonderful views of the harbour and the rooms are modern and clean.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9870853424072266] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.8850860595703125] My rating would have been 5 stars, except the room was quite small for two people 5 days, and the only view was over a roof and hvac unit.
[-0.5322380065917969] I would not recommend this to my friends or family.
[-0.5216445922851562] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.

[0.9749526977539062] The location is very good being very close to downtown and most city attractions.
[0.96282958984375] The biggest obivious attraction of this hotel is its location - smack dab in the middle of Granville Island, and therefore close to the restaurants, markets, shops, and galleries that are all nearby.
[0.9494752883911133] This hotel is located close enough to downtown to walk to in 1/2 hour( using the aquabus to cross the channel) but also very close to local interesting sites on granville island and is a 15 min walk to Broadway St and 4th Ave where there are numerous placed to eat.
[0.9329776763916016] It's close walking distance to everything we want to walk to: shops, restaurants, views and the seawall trail.
[0.9162130355834961] Close to the market, the Arts Club Theatre, funky shops and downtown.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.50115966796875] In a beautiful, quiet location, it has so much to offer.
[-0.42357635498046875] The evenings are quiet and perfect for a good nights sleep.
[-0.3687400817871094] Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel.
[-0.3647499084472656] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.3033447265625] Normally, you can only park for 3 hours on the island, which isn't nearly enough time to wander around and see everything, but the hotel offers free parking.

[0.9131584167480469] It was like a peaceful oasis in a major metropolitan area.
[0.8959541320800781] In a beautiful, quiet location, it has so much to offer.
[0.8620204925537109] The room was quiet and we did not notice any noise from "neighbors".
[0.7945060729980469] I've stayed in all types, all ratings of hotels around the world and I rank Granville Island Hotel as one of my top picks due to the location and relaxed environment... especially for an adult getaway.
[0.7721748352050781] The walls were thick and the hotel had a quiet but friendly feel to it.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.996854305267334] It was exceptionally noisy.
[-0.9952702522277832] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.9626131057739258] Now the traffic on the way to Kelowna was another thing altogether...we stayed too long and hit rush hour!
[-0.9555454254150391] There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.
[-0.95013427734375] We could hear chairs and people moving around in the adjoining room as if it was in our room mostly because of the echoing from the marble floors.

[0.9360485076904297] The area is amazing with lots of shopping, great food and beautiful views!
[0.9021701812744141] It is great to be on the "Island" and able to visit all the great shops and the Market.
[0.8805599212646484] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.
[0.8759498596191406] The location is the biggest draw for us, Granville Island by day is full of energy, a great place to pick up something tasty at the Public Market, find a seat, listen to the buskers and people watch.

[-0.5164947509765625] In the other part of the room, we could sleep or just have breakfast in bed while watching the other television in the room.

[0.93426513671875] Within a 2 minute walk there are fantastic spots for breakfast, lunch and dinner and fun shopping and access to the sea wall.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9911594390869141] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[-0.9721660614013672] so that when we bought food to bring back to the room, we had nothing to eat it with.
[-0.9526596069335938] Really rocking and that's not a bad thing eh :) But chasing down something to eat this late on the island was hopeless.
[-0.910736083984375] Food isnt great but you are right by the market.
[-0.8894157409667969] For old times sake, we even had lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory, but the food wasn't very good, so we decided to give the city a miss and pootle around the Island instead .

[0.1861572265625] The hair products are not good.
Parent: The only problem was that the hair products could be better.

----- Supporting -----

[0.1861572265625] A tiny problem, but big when you are in a hurry: offer better hair dryers than the low-powered one provided.
