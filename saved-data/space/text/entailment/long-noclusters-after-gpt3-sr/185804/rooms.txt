[0.9756994247436523] The hotel is very good, with decent sized rooms, great prices and excellent service!
[0.9385185241699219] The location, for me, is ideal, the reception very friendly and efficient and the rooms great value for the price.
[0.8911323547363281] We appreciated the favourable room rate we got because of the course at Maiwa that my wife was taking.
[0.8364067077636719] The in room breakfast was exceptional and reasonably priced as were the items in the mini-bar.
[0.78826904296875] The restaurant too was really great and prices were in line with good restaurants in Vancouver.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8556365966796875] It was an acceptable hotel, but definitely not worth the outlandish price.
[-0.798553466796875] We stayed in 6 hotels in all and this was by no means the cheapest, but it was the least appealing.
[-0.79339599609375] The restaurant was a little bit pricey for our budget.
[-0.787353515625] * Way over priced and not the price I had booked online Overall this is a good choice for the location and if it is within your budget, just don't expect too much.
[-0.72113037109375] The rooms are somewhat small and quite expensive considering the size.

[0.9695053100585938] The housekeeping service is excellent; the room was spotless every day.
[0.9534826278686523] The hotel is very good, with decent sized rooms, great prices and excellent service!
[0.9330577850341797] The service from employees is always professional and courteous, the room is extremely clean, the restaurant food is good and the view is impeccable.
[0.9203786849975586] We stayed overnight in one of the rooms which was on the small side, but beautiful views and excellent room service for breakfast the following morning.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9968147277832031] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[-0.9945964813232422] Unfortunately they just don't have the level of service that would make them a great hotel.
[-0.9866771697998047] The service in the restaurant was a bit snobbish and I didn't get the condiments I requested the second morning, however this is minor in my opinion.
[-0.9866657257080078] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.
[-0.9767093658447266] That being said, my room was only okay.

[0.05328559875488281] The prints on the walls were not to everyone's taste.
Parent: Some prints on the walls were not to everyone's taste, but the public spaces were nicely decorated.

----- Supporting -----

[0.05328559875488281] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.01981353759765625] * The doors, wallpaper and carpets need to be redone.
[0.0191192626953125] quiet at night without the often ugly street level scene you encounter at more glamorous high-rises (yes the high-rises can give you great views but coming out at street level you feel like you've walked into a seedy bus station environment).
[0.018646240234375] The desk staff would not look up on Hotels.ca the discrepancies we sited when checking out but they were very cheery and smiling the whole time while denying our information which was infuriating!
[0.0102691650390625] A design school campus brings a funky element to the scene as well as individual artist studios.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.5316944122314453] I have stayed here on business, with Family and with friends and no one has ever been anything but totally impressed.
[-0.5198078155517578] Beautiful scenes abound.
[-0.4472026824951172] It was pure bliss.

[0.6856689453125] All the rooms have been remodeled with nice big screen TVs, very comfortable beds and nice d√©cor.
[0.6426153182983398] It was huge, comfortable ,clean, nicely decorated and with great views over the boats of False Creek.
[0.5436763763427734] It had views of the harbour and the rooms were absolutely beautiful -- nice marble floors too.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9907913208007812] The rooms are small and sparsely furnished.
[-0.9619693756103516] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.9212512969970703] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.8951892852783203] The room was small and dark and old.
[-0.8722953796386719] Just somewhere to sleep.

[0.9814243316650391] It was a very nice room with a beautiful view of the waterfront.
[0.9786825180053711] I had a room with a view of False Creek, comfy beds, pleasant decor, windows that open.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.98712158203125] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.8993682861328125] Basically a food market and some specialist shops.
[-0.866668701171875] The market itself is so interesting and the food is wonderful.
[-0.8569793701171875] It was a bottle of wine with a miniature tuxedo jacket around the bottle.
[-0.856689453125] The market is a must go too.

[0.9186148643493652] We stayed there for a wedding last weekend and the location was handy.
[0.9014978408813477] Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market.
[0.8585939407348633] The location was ideal and the staff were superb.
[0.8223018646240234] To get there, we took the quick little ferry from downtown, and walked with our rolling suitcases to the hotel, conveniently located and yet away from any traffic.
[0.8180923461914062] This location is amazing- I mean you don't have to drive anywhere to get food, drink, entertainment and culture.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9649124145507812] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.8323860168457031] Do not hire a car and try to park it here.
[-0.7256927490234375] There is no easy chair.
[-0.6881332397460938] Think twice if you are going to plan an event there, or at least go in warned!
[-0.6613998413085938] The place is a bit confusing to drive into at night if you're unfamiliar with the area, but my GPS showed the way.

[0.9482736587524414] Our room was very quiet and well appointed.
[0.9312705993652344] The walls were thick and the hotel had a quiet but friendly feel to it.
[0.9187393188476562] It was like a peaceful oasis in a major metropolitan area.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9970531463623047] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.9966492652893066] Now the traffic on the way to Kelowna was another thing altogether...we stayed too long and hit rush hour!
[-0.9965095520019531] Granville Island is very busy, & I frequently could not find hotel parking.
[-0.9963226318359375] The V-shaped hotel has its restaurant and bar seating within the V, making for noisy evenings in your room.
[-0.9963059425354004] Great public market, lots of artistic activity.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9755373001098633] My wife and I had a bad experience at GIH.
[-0.9544906616210938] It was exceptionally noisy.
[-0.8926448822021484] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.
[-0.8920440673828125] Initially they were less than courteous about it but i said if there is a charge of course i would play however it might be helpful for future guests to be escorted to the bike and given a brief safety instruction prior to giving someone a key.
[-0.8736381530761719] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8987913131713867] We arrived a little late on Xmas day after a troublesome time with the car rental company (Budget did not have a car for me despite having a valid reservation).
[-0.8666524887084961] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.
[-0.8382854461669922] It was exceptionally noisy.
[-0.8150634765625] The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.
