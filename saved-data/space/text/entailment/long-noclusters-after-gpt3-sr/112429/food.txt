[0.20623779296875] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.

Parent: The best thing about the restaurant was its location.

[0.8595619201660156] The location is great, right close to the convention center but other than for the bell man I wouldn't recommend this place.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8062572479248047] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.6488876342773438] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.639404296875] Only negative was the attached restaurant for breakfast.
[-0.58953857421875] Ok, it is bad.
[-0.58587646484375] The halls had a very odd smell, like a dental office.
