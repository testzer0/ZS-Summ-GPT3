[-0.9974188804626465] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !

[-0.9905014038085938] The room is shabby, the shower made a horrible noise whenever the water was running.
[-0.9178848266601562] The room was plain and average-szed, but clean and comfortable.
[-0.9107189178466797] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
[-0.9106464385986328] I was put in a room that just didn't have the feeling be being fresh and clean.
