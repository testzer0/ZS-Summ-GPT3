[-0.3397960662841797] Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge.

[-0.997502326965332] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.9937038421630859] The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit.

[-0.9922299385070801] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.9894485473632812] Don't take a room on the inside unless you want to be awakened by the garbage trucks at 5am.

[-0.9856948852539062] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
