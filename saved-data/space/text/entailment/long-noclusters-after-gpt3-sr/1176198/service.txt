[0.8303375244140625] I would avoid the restaurant in the hotel as the service is slow and inconsistent.
[0.5382843017578125] I would not stay her again because of the rude front desk staff and the street noise.
[0.3117218017578125] Hotel rooms and restaurant = great "Valet" = brutal and ruined the whole stay.
[0.26590538024902344] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
[0.1135101318359375] It's pretty clear that this hotel did not train the staff before opening: You can only valet park your car for $35.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9552230834960938] It's not like those old tv's from Marriott.
[-0.9270553588867188] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
