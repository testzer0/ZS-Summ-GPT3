----- Weakening -----

[-0.9896888732910156] Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat.
[-0.9448413848876953] Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in.

[-0.9628448486328125] --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
[-0.9590802192687988] Getting to the room was a fun adventure in itself.
[-0.9451522827148438] The shuttle will drop you at the airport train station if you are going to Seattle, but on your way back you must walk from the station to the shuttle bus pick up area at the airport(about a 5 to 10 minute walk).
[-0.9441947937011719] We got lost as did lots of people we met along the way!
