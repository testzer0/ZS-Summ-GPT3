[0.9575014114379883] My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting.

[-0.996180534362793] When we found our room we discovered that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and there were dirty towels lying around.
[-0.9951038360595703] The bathroom was dirty and stained.
[-0.9944906234741211] This property is a mess.
[-0.9943456649780273] Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.
[-0.9941530227661133] It was so liquified that it spilled all over my hand and burned me terribly.
