[0.14639663696289062] That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.
[0.113983154296875] Excellent services clean and spacious rooms with great view of downtown Miami.Bar off lobby is a great hotel bar.We were given a bottle of champagne for our anniversary.The staff was very accommodating always smiling and engaging in conversation.

[-0.9632110595703125] The Hotel is good - the location is not.
[-0.9450168609619141] The location is less than optimal - the northern edge of Downtown.
[-0.9426097869873047] One of the downsides to this motel is the location.

[-0.9491672515869141] The location is not that good for the regular tourist with no car but a Metromover station is nearby.
[-0.9487972259521484] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.

[0.9852209091186523] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
[0.893463134765625] This was an expensive option, but it was convenient since neither of us in the party was familiar with Miami.
[0.8436164855957031] $28/day for valet and $25/day self parking...very expensive Blood stains on pillow cases...contacted front desk about the issue and they reacted like it was a normal thing and would mention it to housekeeping.
[0.8218994140625] The breakfast buffet is expensive but worth it.
[0.8216667175292969] Though I found the hotel very pricey (for us) I'm sure you could get a much better rate on line.

[-0.9910030364990234] Rate are cheap, but breakfast was not included and hotel charges $20 for breakfast buffet.

[0.9813394546508789] So the hotel - fine, for the cost, if you have to be downtown, it's an OK choice.
[0.9491138458251953] Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing.
[0.9134597778320312] We found the hotel faultless, really clean, excellent service and really good value for money!
[0.9016036987304688] This is a very nice hotel, especially for the price.
[0.710601806640625] Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all.
