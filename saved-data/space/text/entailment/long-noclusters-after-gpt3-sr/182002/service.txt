----- Weakening -----

[-0.9963054656982422] The general feeling of this hotel was tired and run down.
[-0.9949522018432617] The rooms are old, the bathroom smelled, we had a view of air conditioners and the gym was a joke.

[0.8362922668457031] The parking was too expensive.
Parent: Some reviewers found the parking to be a bit expensive, but others appreciated its convenience.

[0.8362922668457031] I`m glad I didn`t have a car, as the parking charges were horrendous.
[0.59490966796875] But from the time they told us we had to go get public parking down the street, to mixed up room arrangement, through just rude service, and a tile falling from the bathroom wall, the price was not worth it.
[0.4757957458496094] The hotel charges $23 for parking, which should be free considering the difficulty it is to get into an actual parking spot.
[0.132720947265625] Afterwards the Manager acknowledged that the lifts are in need of urgent replacement but due to the cost this has yet to be authorised.
[0.08300018310546875] Parking was 23 dollars per night, and it was a bit of a fiasco to even get back into the secure lot to get the car back.

[0.09375] We were advised to park our car about 2 blocks away where there were no "in and out" priviledges.
[0.02098846435546875] Its really tight down there, but there is also a public lot outside which you can use.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.985809326171875] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[-0.9825401306152344] The parking garage was a tight squeeze if you were driving anything bigger than a four door car.
