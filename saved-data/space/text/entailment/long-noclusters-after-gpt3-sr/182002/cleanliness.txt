[0.598297119140625] While I'd agree that the parking garage was hard to manoevre and the elevators were slow, that's as far as the negative experiences I had at this hotel went.
[0.524383544921875] I guess the only thing I didnâ€™t really like was the cost of the parking which was $23 a day, but I guess after paying close to $40 for valet parking at the wedding venue and hearing that someone else at the wedding paid almost $30 for parking at their hotel, I canâ€™t really complain since it looks like Toronto in general is expensive for parking.
[0.065887451171875] The parking garage was a little tight to drive around in, but other than that, I would definately go back for another weekend with the guys.
[0.016198158264160156] Only problem was the carpark was too small.

[-0.9929463863372803] Also which was bothersome was the wifi.
[-0.9928336143493652] The biggest disappointments were: -Elevators (being "updated", bumpy ride, not reliable-ended up on a floor we didn't know we could access!)
[-0.991919994354248] What did bother me though was the cleanliness.
[-0.9918797016143799] A few very minor complaints - the bathroom was very small and a bit cold, since the only heat was from a small baseboard heater.
[-0.9914922714233398] My only complaint would have been that they have a lovely grand piano in the lobby and while I was trying to enjoy my breakfast there was a child playing around on it.
