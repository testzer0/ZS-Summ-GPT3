[-0.9928874969482422] Also the maids probably need to consider dusting in the bathroom lights becuase they were covered in dust!
[-0.9925374984741211] Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it.

Parent: The views from the room were not great, but the room itself was good.

[0.711090087890625] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
[0.39886474609375] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[0.3782958984375] The shower was GREAT, the beds were GREAT but the view was looking at airconditioners which didn't bother us because we weren't looking out that much.
[0.14410400390625] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[0.087188720703125] Dark and moody still.
