[-0.9699277877807617] I have read some of the reviews that spoke of bad service.
[-0.9660148620605469] When I checked out they double billed for the room (once in my name and once in my wife's) and the guy at desk said they had had problems with that happening.
[-0.9556064605712891] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9531288146972656] Furthermore, room service was closed at 10 pm, front desk was unhelpful (in ordering a pizza nonetheless) and Charlie Palmer was a waste of time and energy (great staff, HORRIBLE management.)
[-0.9456892013549805] I have stayed in hotels all over world and this was one of the worst experiences, and that is rating this hotel against much cheaper ones.
