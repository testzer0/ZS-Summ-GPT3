[0.9779806137084961] The location of the hotel is not swanky.
Parent: The location of the hotel is not exactly swanky, but it is close to the airport and downtown Dallas.

[0.9779806137084961] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[0.7300033569335938] The Joule is not luxurious in comparison and not sure why Starwood has it branded as such.
[0.53094482421875] This hotel has a very cramped feel.
[0.43230438232421875] Only little tiny thing is the location ...
[0.40904998779296875] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.

[-0.9614677429199219] We definitely look foward to returning to this downtown Dallas gem.
[-0.9509811401367188] The Joule is an absolute Jewel.
[-0.9420013427734375] the balcony was so cute, had a little picnic table with a great view of the city.
[-0.938690185546875] From the lobby to the rooms, this hotel has been very tastefully decorated â€¢ Rooms â€“ Very chic rooms.
[-0.9319725036621094] The hotel was beautiful; the staff was very accommodating; and it was very easy working with a large group.

[0.9520645141601562] The hotel is in a nice location with good access to some great restaurants.
[0.7800178527832031] From it's convenient location to the Dallas business hub for guests, to the captivating style of the hotel, to the impeccable service, this was the perfect place for my event.
[0.7749156951904297] The convenient location of The Joule allowed us to choose from a variety of restaurants.
[0.7468833923339844] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[0.5934181213378906] I suggest you take a look at the managment position as the pool ran out of Chardoney on Saturday night before 10pm and no one offered to go get us some more.

[-0.636444091796875] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[-0.5587692260742188] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[-0.41954803466796875] It needs to be removed ASAP.
[-0.4068603515625] The only drawback was that the room faced a dilapidated building next door and they were doing construction on that side to extend the hotel (no construction noise on the weekend, just a view of the construction and rundown building!).
[-0.3711395263671875] I was so livid with how it was being handled that I was ready to completely lose it.

[0.6213836669921875] Some of the younger front desk staff tend to be a little snooty.
[0.49088287353515625] After calling down to the desk, they did not even give a simple apology.
[0.4905853271484375] The actual service at the front desk seemed a bit patchy, depending on who was there.
[0.46502685546875] When I checked out they double billed for the room (once in my name and once in my wife's) and the guy at desk said they had had problems with that happening.

[-0.762420654296875] Need a ride to the State Fair?
[-0.7499847412109375] We especially enjoyed our time at the pool, and Todd made the weekend so much more fun!
[-0.7435531616210938] The adults at the pool were making out to the point a few of the couples should have went back to their rooms, needless to say we didn't stay at the pool long.
[-0.7375640869140625] Great food.

[-0.9908452033996582] We arrived there and were greeted out front by a wonderful staff that helped to unload and park the car.
[-0.9907529354095459] When the elevator opened on the floor of the pool, we could already hear and feel the bass from the LOUD music and crowd.
[-0.9893229007720947] The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona.
[-0.9892868995666504] The smell when you walked into the lobby was breathtaking...the fragrance was wonderful.
[-0.989274263381958] I was treated wonderfully.
