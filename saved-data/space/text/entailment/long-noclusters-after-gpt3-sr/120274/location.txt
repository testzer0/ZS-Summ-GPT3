[0.48424530029296875] The hotel is located a little out of the way for Universal, Prime Outlets (formerly Beltz), IDrive etc.
Parent: The location of the hotel is a little out of the way for Universal, Prime Outlets (formerly Beltz), IDrive etc but it's only 5 minutes from Disney, you can see the top of Expedition Everest from the car park at the back!

[0.048797607421875] However if the slightest sign of dirt or grime gives you cause to reach for the phone and call reception, I would pass on this hotel for 2 reasons.
[0.042266845703125] BUT personally i always stay clear of international drive as i find it quite run down and too busy............if you enjoy the 192 area of kissimee then this hotel is fine!
[0.022308349609375] You walk on the carpet just feels so sticky.. About the location, compared to the other on celebrations area, seems not so close to those theme parks.
[0.017230987548828125] You have to cross the car park to get there and believe me it's not worth the trip.
