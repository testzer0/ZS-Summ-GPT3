[0.1610107421875] We were initially worried as our room was adjacent to the patio and we feared lots of noise, but it was quiet after 10 pm, the beds were great and we both a great sleep, and really enjoyed visiting the market before we left for Kelowna.

[0.9541702270507812] The walls were thick and the hotel had a quiet but friendly feel to it.
[0.9343223571777344] Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
[0.9319953918457031] I've stayed in all types, all ratings of hotels around the world and I rank Granville Island Hotel as one of my top picks due to the location and relaxed environment... especially for an adult getaway.
[0.9042816162109375] If you're looking for a smaller (decent sized) hotel with a relaxed environment (not to mention romantic), and is a 3 minute drive (5 minute water taxi ride) from downtown Vancouver, then this IS the hotel for you.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9963693618774414] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.9951438903808594] It was exceptionally noisy.
[-0.9947957992553711] The V-shaped hotel has its restaurant and bar seating within the V, making for noisy evenings in your room.
[-0.9897422790527344] Granville Island is very busy, & I frequently could not find hotel parking.
[-0.9875392913818359] Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling.

[-0.7822952270507812] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.7501602172851562] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.

[0.15820884704589844] For one it is the only hotel on the island and two it is a very nice hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9602165222167969] Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel.
[-0.939208984375] It's a really cool market.
[-0.93023681640625] It features a children's carnival, which is great for families, but not very appealing to business travelers.
[-0.8965530395507812] A design school campus brings a funky element to the scene as well as individual artist studios.
[-0.8838386535644531] The market may be unique in North America, but in the UK most towns and cities have a market at least as good.
