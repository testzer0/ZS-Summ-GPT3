[0.7901039123535156] The walls were thick and the hotel had a quiet but friendly feel to it.
[0.769561767578125] Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
[0.672149658203125] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.

[-0.9961142539978027] It was exceptionally noisy.
[-0.993718147277832] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.9881019592285156] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.9880247116088867] The V-shaped hotel has its restaurant and bar seating within the V, making for noisy evenings in your room.
[-0.9861841201782227] The room also had a weird smell.

[-0.9904317855834961] Basically a food market and some specialist shops.
[-0.9856224060058594] The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets.
[-0.9854598045349121] I especially enjoyed the Public Market.
[-0.9838466644287109] The market may be unique in North America, but in the UK most towns and cities have a market at least as good.
[-0.9828395843505859] It's a really cool market.

[0.9823102951049805] The public spaces are decorated nicely.
Parent: The public spaces are nicely decorated , but our room had a couple of sad " department store " prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity , I would have loved to see better art ( why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street , and promote local artists ? )
