[0.7755126953125] We enjoyed a quick, one-night visit to Vancouver, and stayed at the Granville Island Hotel.
[0.67181396484375] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[0.4961090087890625] The wonderful public market and numerous restaurants and shops are just a quick walk away, as are the ferries that take you to other parts of Vancouver.
[0.3814849853515625] Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes.
[0.279632568359375] A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions.

[-0.7918052673339844] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.7884941101074219] Granville Island is very busy, & I frequently could not find hotel parking.
[-0.7690200805664062] Now the traffic on the way to Kelowna was another thing altogether...we stayed too long and hit rush hour!
[-0.72113037109375] Drove to Whistler and spent a week there.
[-0.7127456665039062] My wife and I had a bad experience at GIH.

[0.321319580078125] It's a calm, well-designed "boutique" hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island.
[0.31298828125] The Granville Island Hotel was overall really nice.
[0.27459716796875] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).

[0.9343223571777344] Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
[0.9319953918457031] I've stayed in all types, all ratings of hotels around the world and I rank Granville Island Hotel as one of my top picks due to the location and relaxed environment... especially for an adult getaway.
[0.9042816162109375] If you're looking for a smaller (decent sized) hotel with a relaxed environment (not to mention romantic), and is a 3 minute drive (5 minute water taxi ride) from downtown Vancouver, then this IS the hotel for you.

[-0.9963693618774414] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.9951438903808594] It was exceptionally noisy.
[-0.9947957992553711] The V-shaped hotel has its restaurant and bar seating within the V, making for noisy evenings in your room.

[-0.8509693145751953] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.8307819366455078] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.8031082153320312] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.7822952270507812] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.7501602172851562] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.

[-0.9748649597167969] Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel.
[-0.9553489685058594] It features a children's carnival, which is great for families, but not very appealing to business travelers.
[-0.9463005065917969] It's a really cool market.

[0.0992584228515625] One of the drawbacks of staying on Granville Island is the parking - almost impossible at the weekend, even after paying the hotel $7 for a pass that allows you to park beyond the normal 3 hour limit.
[0.083587646484375] If you're looking to stay at a big hi-rise in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown, then this place is not for you.
[0.0825042724609375] Although the hotel has parking for a daily fee, it is best not to bring your car as the island is definitely best seen on foot and driving on the island is difficult as pedestrians are everywhere.

Parent: The public spaces are nicely decorated , but our room had a couple of sad " department store " prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity , I would have loved to see better art ( why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street , and promote local artists ? )
