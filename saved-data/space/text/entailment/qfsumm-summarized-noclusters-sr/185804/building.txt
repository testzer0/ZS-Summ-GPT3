[0.9541702270507812] The walls were thick and the hotel had a quiet but friendly feel to it.
[0.9343223571777344] Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
[0.9319953918457031] I've stayed in all types, all ratings of hotels around the world and I rank Granville Island Hotel as one of my top picks due to the location and relaxed environment... especially for an adult getaway.
[0.9042816162109375] If you're looking for a smaller (decent sized) hotel with a relaxed environment (not to mention romantic), and is a 3 minute drive (5 minute water taxi ride) from downtown Vancouver, then this IS the hotel for you.

[-0.9963693618774414] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.9951438903808594] It was exceptionally noisy.
[-0.9947957992553711] The V-shaped hotel has its restaurant and bar seating within the V, making for noisy evenings in your room.
[-0.9897422790527344] Granville Island is very busy, & I frequently could not find hotel parking.
[-0.9875392913818359] Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8509693145751953] I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel.
[-0.8307819366455078] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.8031082153320312] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.7822952270507812] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.
[-0.7501602172851562] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.

[0.84490966796875] The hotel is very modern, with the feel of a boutique 5 star hotel.
[0.273681640625] The hotel restaraunt was ok, not outstanding but pretty good.
[0.195068359375] I stay at other expensive hotels similar to this and they do this service, they also do not charge for the bikes if you are a guest of the hotel.
[0.15820884704589844] For one it is the only hotel on the island and two it is a very nice hotel.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9602165222167969] Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel.
[-0.939208984375] It's a really cool market.
[-0.93023681640625] It features a children's carnival, which is great for families, but not very appealing to business travelers.
[-0.8965530395507812] A design school campus brings a funky element to the scene as well as individual artist studios.
[-0.8838386535644531] The market may be unique in North America, but in the UK most towns and cities have a market at least as good.
