[0.6552886962890625] We cannot comment on the value, as our price was included in our group travel, so Iwe're sure it was a group or discounted rate.
[0.1177978515625] This is a multi story well thought out hotel.
[0.1043701171875] Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot.
[0.0323486328125] Was hoping it would stop but it kept going (empty at that).
[0.0247802734375] This property is a mess.

[-0.9672031402587891] At $65 plus the upgrade this was outstanding value, so much so we used it on our return journey too.
[-0.9584789276123047] It's a solid 3* hotel and good value.
[-0.9584236145019531] We have stayed here a few times and keep coming back because it is good value for money.
[-0.9568824768066406] This hotel is clean, neat and offers good value for the money.
[-0.9464530944824219] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.

[-0.9931564331054688] And they add a $3 tip on top of the 18% (and then all the regular taxes are there, too).
[-0.9892101287841797] We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee.
