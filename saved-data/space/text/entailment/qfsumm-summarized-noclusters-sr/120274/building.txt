[0.9798145294189453] The location is not convenient for Universal, Prime Outlets, and I Drive.
Parent: The location is a little out the way for Universal , Prime Outlets ( formerly Beltz ) , I Drive etc but it 's only 5 minutes from Disney , you can see the top of Expedition Everest from the car park at the back !!

[0.0795745849609375] A hidden treasure of small shops with amusement rides that I didn't even know about ( I only drove by it over a dozen times) and it's mostly free!
[0.04742431640625] BUT personally i always stay clear of international drive as i find it quite run down and too busy............if you enjoy the 192 area of kissimee then this hotel is fine!
[0.0467529296875] Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative.
[0.0393218994140625] VERY cheap mall , we walked in and walked out right away.
