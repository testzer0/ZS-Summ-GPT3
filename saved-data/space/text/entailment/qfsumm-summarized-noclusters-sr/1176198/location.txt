[0.2725677490234375] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
[0.26190185546875] I would avoid the restaurant in the hotel as the service is slow and inconsistent.
[0.0925445556640625] We requested a later check out and they would not accommodate this....which I have never had happen before.
[0.0496368408203125] Anyway, we called visa and it turns out that the Hotel had been entering the wrong expiry date.

[-0.9796199798583984] BAD: Make sure you request a room that is not above the nightclub downstairs on Peter St. We were on the 17th floor & we could still hear all the music, even with our windows shut.

[-0.9969892501831055] That was a bit of a pain, but understandable, because it was getting extremely rowdy and it was clear people were bringing in about 10 people into one room.
