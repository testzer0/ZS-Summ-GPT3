[0.9905300140380859] After staying for a week in late September, I decided to write a review.
Parent: Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review ; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge .

[0.4021759033203125] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.
