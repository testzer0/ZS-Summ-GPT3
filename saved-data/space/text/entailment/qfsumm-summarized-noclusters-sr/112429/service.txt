[0.3227996826171875] The reviews were not accurate.
Parent: Reading some reviews after staying for a week in late September prompted me to add my review ; I think some of the unhappy reviewers need to do their research better before booking a hotel so as not to blame the hotel for their own lack of knowledge .

[0.3227996826171875] The not so good: The hotel had touted a 2 person tub - and while it was a soaking tub - it wasn't comfortable for two.
[0.28350830078125] My pancakes were delicious, but I was a little disappointed with the "hash brows" because they were really only cubed potatoes.
[0.2433929443359375] The Paramount is understated- the lobby is small and cozy and the location, while close to everything downtown, is subtly placed.
[0.22491455078125] Rocked up to The Paramount Hotel not expecting much after a not so nice hotel experience in New York but boy was I wrong.
[0.14678955078125] For the price I paid, I was perfectly content and I'm surprised about all the bellyaching in previous reviews - maybe they paid too much.

[-0.9583320617675781] I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to my next visit so I can come back to my home away from home in Seattle.

[0.0202789306640625] He was very rude and would not let me use the phone to call other hotels for vacancies.
[0.0196075439453125] I do think this hotel is going to raise their rates and won't be worth it unless they pay attention to what guests on here are saying.
[0.0137481689453125] Pretty basic information for a concierge to screw up on!
[0.00443267822265625] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !

[0.0286407470703125] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.

[0.626129150390625] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.
