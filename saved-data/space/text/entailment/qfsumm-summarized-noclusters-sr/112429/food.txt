[0.0772247314453125] The choice of channels for the tv is terrible....for the amount you pay this place you should get more than 20 channels....the only thing great about this place is the water pressure.

[0.7637939453125] Needless to say we left the hotel very frustrated and upset.
[0.7532634735107422] We were sad that we didnt get to stay longer at this hotel.
[0.6459884643554688] Generally, when we stay at a downtown Seattle hotel, we are happy to be getting back to our own homes and beds, but with Paramount, we were sorry we didn't have a few more days.
[0.5732936859130859] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.

[-0.39275169372558594] It's Asian inspired and they have some incredible little dishes of sushi and japanese type dishes.

[0.037872314453125] My gripe was that housekeeping must have noticed this when they changed the sheets, but made no attempt at cleaning the mattress and simply covered it back up.
[0.012786865234375] So now we are out a GPS and will NEVER stay at the Paramount again.
