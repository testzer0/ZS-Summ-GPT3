[0.9655237197875977] The hotel is very conveniently located in downtown Toronto and overall the stay was very satisfactory for the price.
[0.9569473266601562] The hotel is very conveniently located to the nearby entertainment district, and 20 min walk to the island ferries, and is convenient to the Queen and King Streetcar lines if you wish to go further.
[0.9453868865966797] My fiance and I stayed at this hotel the last time we went to Toronto to see a jays ball game, located a few footsteps from the cn tower/rogers centre, very convenient location, very good price, clean room, friendly staff, but as other reviews say, and we were expecting it and didn't mind considering the price and location, this hotel is right next to a night club, so the music really boom booms until early morning, unless you are a light sleeper, I would recommend this hotel to you.

[-0.8092193603515625] Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends.
[-0.756561279296875] my boyfriend and i both went home sore and dead tired from trying to find a comfortable way to sleep tossing and turning all night but there was none.

[0.7987213134765625] I have stayed at this Hilton Garden on Peter street on business many, many times-so when planning a weekend visit with the family I had no hesitation to book- Its well situated, clean and modern and generally a very good value and the Hhnonors perks are good- WOW what a difference during the weekend-instead of business folk and tourists-its packed with club kids and partyers-the staff do their best-but its noisy and the area around the hotel is pretty crazy late in the evening on weekends- I will stay again during the week-but never on a weekend
[0.71966552734375] The Hilton Garden Inn is in a great location within walking distance of C.N.Tower and Rogers Stadium and next to a wide selection of restaurants,bars,shops etc There are fresh apples to help yourself each morning and cookies at night,also complimentary drinks on some days ?The rooms are spacious and clean BUT if you are stayingThursday through until Sunday there is a club with a patio next door and the noise is terrific until around three in the morning so if your not out yourself you will not sleep.We only had this experience on the Sat night the rest of our stay was perfect through until the following Wednesday.Fridge,microwave abd coffe maker in room really useful.Go to the italian quarter for some really great little restaurants and bars.Toronto is a terrific city ENJOY!
[0.571868896484375] Nice staff, great location, wonderful breakfast, clean modern rooms, but if your room is on the south side of the building, the noise from the club next door will rock your world until about 2:30 AM.

[-0.8948402404785156] Convenient location, quiet and large room (mine was very quiet, while some rooms are not because of the proximity of night clubs), wonderful breakfast, free Internet.
[-0.5463600158691406] They told us there were no other rooms with a Jacuzzi (which was bull on a Wednesday night).

[0.972076416015625] (once we figured out how to work all the shower heads) The walls were very thin though-we could really hear our neighbours mini party at 2AM in the morning.
[0.9344406127929688] There was a little noise in the adjacent rooms, walls are paper-thin as in most hotels.
[0.04192352294921875] we were so tired and sore from bad sleep we went home early on monday without shopping or anything the room was kind of plain we had the room with a jacuzzi and fireplace but both nights when we were in bed sleeping the jacuzzi mysteriously turned on and woke us both up and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off.
[0.011993408203125] Room was very comfortable, good location for sightseeing in Toronto, breakfasts cooked to order, and all went well until the third night when the nightclub next door went into action.

Parent: Additionally, one guest noted that the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night.

----- Supporting -----

[0.552398681640625] I was there the morning of the false fire alarm and although it was annoying I would rather it be false than for real!
[0.2635498046875] We were on the fourteenth floor and though we couldn't hear the music (which lasted until around 4 A.M.) the beat of the base permeated through the walls and just couldn't be stopped.
[0.09165191650390625] The only bad things that i can mention are that during my stay another guest decided to set the fire alarm of at 04:30, not a wake up call I want to repeat.
[0.037384033203125] Key cards kept deactivating so we had to go up and down elevator several times to have it reactivated.
[0.030731201171875] That was a bit of a pain, but understandable, because it was getting extremely rowdy and it was clear people were bringing in about 10 people into one room.
