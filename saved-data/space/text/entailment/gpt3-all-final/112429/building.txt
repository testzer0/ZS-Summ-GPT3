----- Weakening -----

[-0.9974751472473145] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.9971456527709961] The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit.
[-0.9961471557617188] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.9957284927368164] Stripping the sheets, I found a fairly fresh urine stain that made me want to vomit.
[-0.995185375213623] Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom.

Parent: The building was clean and comfortable, with a convenient location near shopping and public transportation.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9501609802246094] It was a convenient location, but not a luxurious accomodation.
[0.949223518371582] The pros: - Convenient the location, walking distance to Pike Place Market (8 short blocks) and Bell Town.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9880161285400391] The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me.
[-0.9006919860839844] I guess that's standard practice in downtown hotels, but it really makes it cumbersome to get the car.
[-0.8294334411621094] The only minor thing that I did not like was that they ice machines are on every other floor and located next to the stairwell, so it was a little startling to my girlfriend when someone walked in unbeknownst to her while the machine was running.
[-0.8214263916015625] Valet parking was terrible.
[-0.8175563812255859] The only thing I didn't care for was the fitness center, which was sort of a dungeon in the basement.

[0.78173828125] A functional hotel, comfortable, worth its price.
[0.577178955078125] The best thing about the Paramount Hotel is it's location and price compared to other downtown hotels.
[0.5602035522460938] Now, a few drawbacks - the hotel charges $9.95/day for wifi, does any other motel/hotel anywhere do that anymore?

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9933052062988281] And in a hotel that is very affordable and nicely located.
[-0.9912548065185547] I made the reservation with hesitation, because the room rate was quite affordable in comparison with other things in the area, but the level of service and the quality of the accommodations matched those of more expensive properties nearby.
[-0.9885101318359375] My companion and I stayed at this hotel because it was one of the most affordable on the day we went.

[-0.9807729721069336] Only two blocks to the front door of the convention center (under the canopy) and right in the heart of everything you need - Pacific Place Mall is two blocks, there are three - count 'em - three Starbucks within two blocks and a Barnes and Noble bookstore.
