[0.2137451171875] The hotel has gone through some renovations which make it look nice, Dragonfish changed their menu a bit but their food is still good.
[0.105712890625] Dragonfish restaurant attached is not run by the hotel but lets you sign charges to your room, and is a very good place, if a bit pricey.
[0.0422515869140625] The restaurant (Dragonfish) has amazing food, and a wonderful happy hour small plates menu, though it can get quite busy, the hostess just took our room number and called us when our reservation was ready.

[0.9567298889160156] The baggage staff was very slow and had no sense of urgency to help us with our bags.
[0.3903350830078125] Some other minor issues were the desk chair in the room (it fell short of an appropriate working height of the desk and constantly fell down when your leg accidently hit the adjustment bar in front, poor choice of chairs), the elevator door was annoyingly slow to close (I was up and down several times per day), the exterior and lobby doors should be automatic and I noticed people struggling to open them and get their luggage through, they also were misaligned and did not open well.
[0.3778839111328125] It was very quiet.
