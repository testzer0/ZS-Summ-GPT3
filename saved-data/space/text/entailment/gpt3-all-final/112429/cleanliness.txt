[-0.997502326965332] I stayed one night in the Paramount in room 315..Buyer beware, do not stay in this room as it overlooks the back parking lot over the Huge garbage dump..Also, faces the vents from the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel so the room is filled with the smell of frying foods(horrible) and garbage....Even if your window(small) is closed and the a/c on, the smell overwhelms !
[-0.9937038421630859] The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit.

[-0.9922299385070801] It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window.
[-0.9894485473632812] Don't take a room on the inside unless you want to be awakened by the garbage trucks at 5am.

[0.21976470947265625] Unfortunately, room service wasn't as good.
[0.1256103515625] The maids had left the alarm on from the last guest (a major pet peeve of mine) and so we were awakened at 7 a.m. And, a large group of guests arrived in the room next door at 7:30 and the lack of soundproofing between connecting rooms became glaringly apparent.
[0.12052154541015625] Front desk could only ask me if I had the privacy card on the door (I did not) and then shrug.
[0.10658836364746094] But I thought the staff were unprofessional and I was uncomfortable with the men at the desk.

[0.598388671875] I cannot say for sure that it was due to the room but it is highly suspect.
[0.392547607421875] May be just a problem with that room and wasn't a big issue only being there for the one night.

[0.239990234375] It was a wonderful hotel, but not intimidating or snobbish.
