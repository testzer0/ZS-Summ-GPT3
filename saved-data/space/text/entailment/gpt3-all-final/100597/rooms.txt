[0.9219818115234375] There was no wifi in the rooms.
Parent: Some guests were disappointed that there was no wifi in the rooms, and others found the parking fees to be expensive.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9219818115234375] No wireless in the rooms.
[0.9157638549804688] (and no in room wireless).
[0.8936767578125] If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate.
[0.39459228515625] No frig or microwaves in Doubletree hotels, too many pillows on the bed.
[0.18422508239746094] Unfortunately there was no wifi and the parking was $16 per night - expensive for the area.

[-0.9865083694458008] On the incoming leg earlier, we stayed across the street at the Hampton for about the same price, wireless internet, free parking and free breakfast.
