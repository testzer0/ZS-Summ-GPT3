[0.8515987396240234] Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room.

----- Supporting -----

[0.88330078125] Staff wise, this hotel also needs renovation.
[0.8773384094238281] One wing building was closed for renovation.
[0.7495346069335938] Even where renovated, the hotel still needs work.
[0.6840248107910156] Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these "Hilton Honors" rooms really need refurbishing.
[0.5683193206787109] Ours was kind of dingy, definitely in need of a remodeling.

[0.9308061599731445] Bathroom floors seems dirty and needed to be regrouted.
[0.22053146362304688] But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected.
[0.15164947509765625] My room, in the renovated tower, had very insufficient lighting and a bathroom that had seen better days.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8987312316894531] My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting.

[-0.8618011474609375] Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.

Parent: However, some guests noted that the building was in need of refurbishing, especially the bathrooms, and that the rooms could be noisy.

----- Supporting -----

[0.745025634765625] The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc.
[0.7435455322265625] The bed was comfortable but between the noise of the traffic ( not the jets) and the room fan, we did not sleep well.
[0.653228759765625] When you finally reach your room the heaters all make tremendous noise, rattle, rumble.
[0.628814697265625] I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room.
[0.577728271484375] The most disturbing noises came not from the jet planes across the street, but from the hallway.
