[0.9137477874755859] The hotel is older but the room was huge and had a view all the way to the lake.

[-0.8491439819335938] I could not believe what they charged for a room at this hell-hole, and it is funny just around the corner from the building is a "back-packer's hostel which I thought would have been much better than this dump.

[0.2053375244140625] I do not recomemnd taking the elevators in the morning if you are only a few flights from the main floor because people are sardined in the elevator please take the stairs.

[-0.7742843627929688] Close to good restaurants.
[-0.69610595703125] The hotel books a lot of bus tours, and some mornings it can take a very long time to get an elevator, because they are being monopolized by the bus tourists, who are all trying to leave at once.
[-0.68341064453125] Finally, we came back to the hotel at around midnight after seeing the tennis match and having dinner and come to find out that there were hookers on almost every corner surrounding the hotel.
