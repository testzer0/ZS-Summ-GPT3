[0.9314594268798828] Everybody was very nice and I can't say enough about the great location.
[0.90032958984375] We last stayed here 4 years ago and really loved the location.

[0.8692398071289062] We had our wedding reception at GI Hotel last week and couldn't have been more thrilled with the location, venue, food and overall service excellence that we received.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9710044860839844] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.966949462890625] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
[-0.9643516540527344] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.9577903747558594] Do not hire a car and try to park it here.
[-0.9215240478515625] Our only real disappontment was when we walked around Gastown, which really seems to have got shabby since our last visit.

[0.8563785552978516] It's a calm, well-designed "boutique" hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island.
[0.8115863800048828] This is a very well set up hotel.
[0.4816627502441406] The hotel was well appointed, our room comfortable and decorated in a traditional style.
[0.31615734100341797] It had views of the harbour and the rooms were absolutely beautiful -- nice marble floors too.
[0.3124675750732422] The rooms were well appointed.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.7580032348632812] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.7073135375976562] Oh, and the sauna was broken.
[-0.6967620849609375] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.6557464599609375] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.
[-0.62823486328125] Initially ck'd into tiny dark room - no way!

Parent: The building was generally praised for its location, design, and views.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8672027587890625] After living in Vancouver for several years, then coming back to visit, we found this hotel gave us an entirely different perspective of the city - one that we fully appreciated!
[0.8139228820800781] We asked for a room with a view of the water and were very happy with the beautiful view.
[0.7744216918945312] The service from employees is always professional and courteous, the room is extremely clean, the restaurant food is good and the view is impeccable.
[0.6127777099609375] Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
[0.5867271423339844] It was all lovely, beautiful venue with the patio and city and water view, delicious food, all the guests and a great time!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.94879150390625] Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing.
[-0.8531570434570312] That view is killer, and with two decks with which to view it!
[-0.7689361572265625] The only drawback could be room size as ours was only just adequate and the view was rather restricted.
[-0.722564697265625] My rating would have been 5 stars, except the room was quite small for two people 5 days, and the only view was over a roof and hvac unit.
[-0.6591472625732422] We were told none were available.

[0.9815502166748047] The rooms were too small.
Parent: However, some guests found the rooms small and smelly, and parking difficult to find.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9815502166748047] As I said the rooms are too small for all that furniture.

[0.7913417816162109] The rooms are incredibly small.
[0.668212890625] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.
[0.456634521484375] The room was the smallest we stayed in during our tour of western Canada, and it was a struggle to fit in a rollaway bed for my son.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9970650672912598] The room was very spacious with a lovely king size bed and nice toiletries, replenished daily.
[-0.997035026550293] Big rooms with lots of windows.
[-0.9969768524169922] The rooms are large, each with a small balcony and most have a view of the water.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9222297668457031] The room also had a weird smell.
[0.34381103515625] Very peacful at night and sitting by the fire in the bar prior to dinner was so relaxing.
[0.275634765625] Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling.
[0.0007076263427734375] We recently had an extremely bad stay at an American Sheraton hotel, and were a bit gunshy about staying in ANY hotel again...haha.
[0.0003643035888671875] My wife and I had a bad experience at GIH.

[0.9491901397705078] Parking was difficult to find.

[0.9491901397705078] Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes.
[0.9163551330566406] One of the drawbacks of staying on Granville Island is the parking - almost impossible at the weekend, even after paying the hotel $7 for a pass that allows you to park beyond the normal 3 hour limit.
[0.8989524841308594] Granville Island is very busy, & I frequently could not find hotel parking.
[0.8978805541992188] Parking is a problem, and you will probably need to use the valet parking available at the hotel which costs $7.
[0.6620712280273438] The location is FANTASTIC for anyone who wants to be close to downtown but not right in the middle of the busy traffic and challenging parking.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9807901382446289] Easy to park your car right in the lot in front of the hotel or the hotel staff will even volunteer to park it for you.
[-0.9746246337890625] We paid $12 a day for the extended stay parking pass and never once had trouble finding a spot next to the hotel.
[-0.9590415954589844] We never had a problem parking the car even though the island gets very busy on the weekends.
[-0.9569664001464844] Couldn't have asked for a better location, and although we stayed in August, parking never seemed to be an issue except that it was $12.00 plus tax .....ouch!
[-0.7877960205078125] Cabs are readily available streetside.
