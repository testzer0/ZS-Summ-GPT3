[0.9779024124145508] The location was perfect.
[0.9670429229736328] The location is great, the waitstaff good and the food ok.
[0.9658493995666504] The location is excellent and they give you a parking permit to park on the island (normally there is a 3 hour maximum).
[0.9610419273376465] The location is just perfect.
[0.9590344429016113] The location is very good being very close to downtown and most city attractions.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9384613037109375] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.7866744995117188] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
[-0.527008056640625] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.4973297119140625] The service was good.
[-0.432281494140625] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.

[0.8960151672363281] This location is amazing- I mean you don't have to drive anywhere to get food, drink, entertainment and culture.
[0.883336067199707] We stayed there for a wedding last weekend and the location was handy.
[0.8480720520019531] Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market.
[0.8155002593994141] The location is FANTASTIC for anyone who wants to be close to downtown but not right in the middle of the busy traffic and challenging parking.
[0.8115386962890625] The location, for me, is ideal, the reception very friendly and efficient and the rooms great value for the price.

[-0.8456764221191406] Do not hire a car and try to park it here.
[-0.7445831298828125] There is no easy chair.

[-0.5836410522460938] Think twice if you are going to plan an event there, or at least go in warned!

----- Supporting -----

[0.9353218078613281] It's near enough to the city yet has a different feel - probably because the Island is a working place, not just a tourist trap.
[0.8652114868164062] So, I would recommend this hotel for its unique location and friendly staff.
[0.8567276000976562] The hotel in a different location would have been nice, but the location really made it special for us.
[0.5506362915039062] Small personal feel to it.
[0.4763355255126953] It was like a peaceful oasis in a major metropolitan area.

[-0.8593292236328125] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.828643798828125] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.7861099243164062] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
[-0.75726318359375] The hotel is perfectly acceptable, but does not stand out.
[-0.6060676574707031] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.

[0.30358123779296875] The hotel is not located in an area with a lot of nightlife.
Parent: Some reviewers mentioned that the hotel is not located in an area with a lot of nightlife, but others say that this is not a negative point since it makes the hotel more relaxing.

----- Supporting -----

[0.30358123779296875] quiet at night without the often ugly street level scene you encounter at more glamorous high-rises (yes the high-rises can give you great views but coming out at street level you feel like you've walked into a seedy bus station environment).
[0.29772377014160156] I've stayed in all types, all ratings of hotels around the world and I rank Granville Island Hotel as one of my top picks due to the location and relaxed environment... especially for an adult getaway.
[0.20617294311523438] It's a calm, well-designed "boutique" hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island.
[0.19781494140625] The location of the hotel also makes it easy to have a stroll around Granville Island, but you'll need a taxi to get to the clubs and shopping in the city proper.
[0.1843090057373047] Granville Island is actually a little peninsula (more like a giant pier) with a very laid back feel to it, complete with a down-home fresh foods market, like something you would see in the movies.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9669046401977539] The V-shaped hotel has its restaurant and bar seating within the V, making for noisy evenings in your room.
[-0.9638557434082031] This is a great hotel and obviously a favorite with discerning locals having events...they weren't really an obstruction to our having a great time, but did become something of a joke as both the hotel and adjoining park/marina/galleries are dripping with wedding parties.
[-0.9560832977294922] At night there is live theatre and great dining both on the island as well as a short drive or cab ride away.
[-0.9414310455322266] The Big Bus hop onhop off goes fairly close to the hotel (5-7 min walk) Live Music played most nights from Restaurant which while very good when you have a full day and want to sleep it would go until about midnight.
[-0.9393577575683594] This location is amazing- I mean you don't have to drive anywhere to get food, drink, entertainment and culture.

[0.16884613037109375] The noise level at the hotel was too high.

----- Supporting -----

[0.16884613037109375] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
[0.12841796875] The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second.
[0.06034088134765625] The V-shaped hotel has its restaurant and bar seating within the V, making for noisy evenings in your room.
[0.057834625244140625] We could hear chairs and people moving around in the adjoining room as if it was in our room mostly because of the echoing from the marble floors.
[0.054393768310546875] If you're looking to stay at a big hi-rise in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown, then this place is not for you.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9948318004608154] The walls were thick and the hotel had a quiet but friendly feel to it.
[-0.9934196472167969] The room was quiet and we did not notice any noise from "neighbors".
[-0.9928038120269775] Our room was on the ground floor, and I was initially worried it might be noisy as it had a view of the waiter's water station for the outside patio, but in fact it was very quiet, and we could glimpse the water through the shrubs which preserved our privacy, as well as people-watching.
[-0.9914045333862305] It was like a peaceful oasis in a major metropolitan area.
[-0.985436201095581] It's a calm, well-designed "boutique" hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island.
