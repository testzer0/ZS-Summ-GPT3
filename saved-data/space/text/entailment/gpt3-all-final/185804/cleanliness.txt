[0.8809051513671875] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.

[-0.9720687866210938] It is a mash up of 80s smoked glass and more recent upgrades and pseudo renovations.
[-0.9700984954833984] The room also had a weird smell.
[-0.9693946838378906] Oh, and the sauna was broken.
[-0.9666872024536133] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.
[-0.9661273956298828] Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling.

[0.9519901275634766] I declined and had no problems.
[0.8856925964355469] No worries....
[0.8608055114746094] We never had a problem parking the car even though the island gets very busy on the weekends.
[0.8417510986328125] As they say there "No worries", because you could duck in and out of the little shops and galleries without getting too wet, and when a real downpour came as we were dressed up and heading into the city, we were offered a huge umbrella by the staff, which we kept until check out.
[0.8232574462890625] We paid $12 a day for the extended stay parking pass and never once had trouble finding a spot next to the hotel.

[-0.9986128807067871] Now the traffic on the way to Kelowna was another thing altogether...we stayed too long and hit rush hour!
[-0.9983725547790527] We had a problem with the toilet running and somebody came up to fix it immediately.
[-0.9980983734130859] * The doors, wallpaper and carpets need to be redone.
[-0.9980835914611816] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.
[-0.9980754852294922] There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.

[-0.9871978759765625] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.9816226959228516] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.9794940948486328] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
