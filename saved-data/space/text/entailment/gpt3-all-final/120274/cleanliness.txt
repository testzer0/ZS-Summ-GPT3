[0.9157228469848633] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.
[0.6321029663085938] I'm pretty sure they gave us this hotel so we can compare the 5 star accomadation to this dirty location.
[0.4843902587890625] However if the slightest sign of dirt or grime gives you cause to reach for the phone and call reception, I would pass on this hotel for 2 reasons.
