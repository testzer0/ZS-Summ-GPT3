[-0.9984464645385742] First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.
[-0.998438835144043] This place needs a total refurb, the electrical plug sockets aren't fixed to the wall so plug in at your own risk, lasted only 3 nights(out of &) and had to move hotels, Our room 217 was dirty there was cobwebs on the ceiling and an iron mark in the floor, at first glance it didn't look too bad but look around and it's DIRTY.

[0.9630012512207031] The hotel is actually in a good position on the 192 highway, really near to disney & close to lots of good places to eat - red lobster was the best it was just across the road.
[0.9427642822265625] this hotel is ideally located for disney as there is a road out of the back of the hotel which is a short cut to disney world , turn right out of rear of hotel , left at t junction 2 mins later you are on disney , right by animal kingdom .

Parent: It was also said to be located close to Disney World and to have a good shuttle service to the theme parks.

----- Supporting -----

[0.6752395629882812] Hotel does supply free shuttle buses to all theme parks which go every day and you don't have to bye your tickets from the guest services at the front of the hotel happy holidays.
[0.28307342529296875] The transportation to the parks was a plus too, but there is only 2 trips to disney and 1 to universal and sea world, which is great if you dont have a car, but i recommend driving... there should be more... Also... there are plenty restaurants accross form the hotel to dine inn for a whole week....
[0.15358734130859375] The Hotel does provide free shuttle buses to Sea world, Universal/Islands of Adventure & to the Epcot Centre (transfer by Monorail at Epcot for the other Disney parks).
[0.153472900390625] I am an early riser(6.30 to 7am) and so I had the breakfast area to myself but did get much busy later on.I found all staff to be very helpfull There are a few restaurants and fast food places within walking distance and a Walgreens not far away There is a shuttle bus to Epcot (you need to use Disney Transport to get to other parks) it leaves at 8.45am and about 1pm.
[0.08612060546875] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.

[0.9535226821899414] Cons: - Breakfast was very basic and sometimes it was hard to get a seat.
[0.9450283050537109] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.
[0.8798427581787109] We had breakfast every morning and although basic it was ok. We booked our Universal Studio tickets here and got a very good deal.
[0.8768768310546875] I would not recommend this hotel really - it is very basic, so is the breakfast

----- Weakening -----

[-0.991602897644043] On a better note... the hotel is in a good location and just down the road is a cafe thing where you can get an all you can eat buffet breakfast for very cheap, which served loads of fruit, cakes, a fry up, pretty much anything.
[-0.9792861938476562] The continental breakfast was a bit of a scrum.
[-0.9767990112304688] There are a zillion places to eat along the 192, Ponderosa is great for it's huge buffet breakfast and filling up before a day at the parks.
[-0.9716377258300781] There was always plenty of it as the maid is constantly topping it all up all morning.
[-0.9624242782592773] Also, the hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast.

[0.9655075073242188] All in all i would stay there again but would request having a fridge as all of the rooms do not have them and the ice machine played up alot.
[0.9574050903320312] The motels website states that fridges are in the room, but there was not one to be seen.
[0.83154296875] The fridge and microwave are not available in 'standard' rooms.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7256546020507812] They do advertise free wifi, but in reality, you have to be in the lobby and even then it doesn't work very well.
[0.2935523986816406] My biggest complaint was the lack of internet service.
[0.13336181640625] Now for the negatives again keeping in mind we were able secure a great price for our stay so negatives are very few in our minds Wi-fi does not go much further than the lobby we already knew this from prior reviews and it really didn't matter.
[0.1161346435546875] The wireless internet--somewhat annoying to have to go to the lobby, since it doesn't reach to the rooms.
[0.023410797119140625] If it is this hard to get something accomplished over the phone its obvious customer service is not a priority at this property and i will be too tired to deal with anything less than quality customer service upon my arrival.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9423637390136719] We got a room close to the lobby, but on a floor above, so the WiFi worked n our room, no need to go downstairs!
[-0.9369688034057617] There was a large TV and a safe, when I checked the Wifi on my iPhone it showed full signal.
[-0.8588676452636719] 3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .
