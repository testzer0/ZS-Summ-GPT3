----- Supporting -----

[0.975440502166748] Those small issues aside, this is a lovely hotel in a great area, close to the attractions of Vancouver yet far enough away to provide solace.
[0.9753332138061523] This is not a five star hotel but you are not paying five star prices and as stated above the location is awesome.
[0.9680089950561523] The hotel was reasonable value, and in a great location.
[0.9673633575439453] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
[0.956852912902832] The hotel was cute, trendy and in an amazing location.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.8976497650146484] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
[-0.7939987182617188] If you're looking to stay at a big hi-rise in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown, then this place is not for you.
[-0.7652015686035156] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.5656356811523438] Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel.
[-0.5510730743408203] I would not recommend this to my friends or family.
