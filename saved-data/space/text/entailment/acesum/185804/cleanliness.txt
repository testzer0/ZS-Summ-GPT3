----- Weakening -----

[-0.9888801574707031] The room also had a weird smell.
[-0.9868278503417969] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.9817037582397461] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.
[-0.9744033813476562] Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling.
[-0.9742298126220703] * The doors, wallpaper and carpets need to be redone.
