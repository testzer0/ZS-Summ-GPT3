[0.9695024490356445] The hotel room was pristine and beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly and polite (not at all condescending which can sometimes occur in a high-end hotel like this).
[0.939814567565918] The master bedroom was beautiful, comfortable and had great views of downtown Dallas.
[0.9365177154541016] The room was immaculate - superbly decorated, super clean, and there was a complimentary bottle of champagne for us, with truffles and a lovely note from the manager.
[0.9362125396728516] The room product is gorgeous and the beds are extremely comfortable.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9823207855224609] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.9622745513916016] All in all, this hotel was nothing special with a high price tag.
[-0.930694580078125] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[-0.9257736206054688] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
[-0.9235954284667969] I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.
