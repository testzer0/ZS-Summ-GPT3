[0.9357337951660156] The hotel is in a nice location with good access to some great restaurants.
[0.8435173034667969] Until recently the center of Main Street in Dallas has not been the most amazing location in Dallas to stay, but the Joule is turning into an anchor location with the downtown Nieman Marcus a couple blocks in one direction and the JFK memorial a couple blocks in the other and about 6 or 7 popular restaurants surrounding the hotel.
[0.8398056030273438] The Joule really is a gem and I would return but probably would opt for a different room catogory
[0.8387126922607422] This is a great hotel to visit.
[0.8383159637451172] Zaza is out and the Joule is the place to be

[-0.9360923767089844] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[-0.9358291625976562] I have stayed in hotels all over world and this was one of the worst experiences, and that is rating this hotel against much cheaper ones.
