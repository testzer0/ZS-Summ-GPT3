----- Weakening -----

[-0.995387077331543] It was insulting that the doorman/management were so disrespectful and unwilling to take care of their guest.
[-0.9933905601501465] Once I was at the desk, I still was not offered any help with getting all my luggage to my room.
[-0.9686346054077148] The pool was nice as was the fitness center but with tiny cramped rooms, lack of customer service (I tried calling the desk 3 times and never go through) and the loading dock at the front of the building, I wouldn't recommend it.
[-0.933873176574707] Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I travel frequently and I have never recieved such poor service from an "upscale" hotel.
[-0.9273185729980469] That evening we went down to the club PM which is in hotel very unfriendly and it took us for ever to get in and if your staying at hotel it is suppose to not be a problem to get in YEAH RIGHT!!!!
