----- Weakening -----

[-0.9921464920043945] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.9888648986816406] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[-0.9776992797851562] Front desk staff were not the friendliest...common to big cities perhaps?
[-0.9669075012207031] other issues- bathroom really not that nice, concierge horrible at recommending things to do or good resutarants or giving directions.
[-0.9563102722167969] Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff.
