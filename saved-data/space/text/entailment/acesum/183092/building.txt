[0.8907928466796875] There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.
