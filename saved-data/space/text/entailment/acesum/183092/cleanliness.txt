----- Weakening -----

[-0.9918441772460938] My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.
[-0.9911832809448242] The worst part of the stay however was finding two LARGE insects or animals, something in the room!
[-0.9907646179199219] However, we were very dissapointed when we checked in to find that our sheets had stains on them and looked worn.
[-0.989171028137207] They got louder as the night progressed and started to smoke.
[-0.9887456893920898] We called reception at 3am to get them changed, they were apologetic and changed them immediately but even the 'new' sheets still had holes and looked worn!
