----- Weakening -----

[-0.9952831268310547] The staff was exteremly rude, rooms out dated and smelled!
[-0.9948577880859375] Firstly we could not find the hotel, we needed to go a bit further down on the 192 than we were doing but when we finally got we got checked in very quickly, be warned the reception staff are very rude and unhelpful!!
[-0.9936332702636719] When it was brought to their attention the front desk people were very rude about the problem and the maintence man tried telling us they were "sugar ants" We were promised several different things just so we would not report them to the health department or write a review.
[-0.9818906784057617] The manager on duty was unfriendly and didn't even offer help, until he finally called the police.
[-0.9808979034423828] My main point is: The manager is absolutely rude and holds no responsibility in her job.
