----- Weakening -----

[-0.9965181350708008] The front desk staff were grouchy, uninterested and not pleasant to deal with.
[-0.9960832595825195] No facilities were open early next morning when we were headed for our flight (surprising in such a location where there were lots of people headed for early flights) and although there seem to be a lot of valet staff around, none of them made any effort to assist.
[-0.9795770645141602] We experienced this poor attitude with a few other staff members within the hotel.
[-0.9761104583740234] When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that.
[-0.9601364135742188] Waitress never brought the items we requested and the order was askew.
