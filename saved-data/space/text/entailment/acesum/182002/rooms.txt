----- Weakening -----

[-0.9955883026123047] A few very minor complaints - the bathroom was very small and a bit cold, since the only heat was from a small baseboard heater.
[-0.9948978424072266] The ramps are very steep, the spots are narrow and the driving room is almost non-existent.
[-0.9948740005493164] The elevators are very small, it is cramped with 4 people with luggage.
[-0.9943923950195312] It was small and not very clean.
[-0.9930744171142578] The elevators are very small, so getting a cart and two bodies into the tight space was a difficult.
