[0.9257869720458984] the pool and jacuzzi were awesome after waling around all day.
[0.9200315475463867] The pool itself is just about a perfect size for a downtown hotel...and the water was nice and warm...There really isn't anything more discouraging for a hotel guest than getting ready for the swim, and finding it difficult to get into the pool because the water is too cold...Seems like a little thing, but it's not...This pool was perfect!
[0.8980131149291992] we enjoyed the pool and hot tub albeit not very deep.
[0.8953666687011719] the Pool, while not large, was comfortable and clean, and the workout facilities were excellent.
[0.8919639587402344] The pool and spa were much appreciated as was the Marquis dining room where we had a great breakfast in a relaxed atmosphere.
