----- Weakening -----

[-0.9930448532104492] They told us in a very rude tone and with attitude that our credit card had been declined over the last few days and that they had tried it several time so we would have to provide a cash deposit.
[-0.9910793304443359] I would not stay her again because of the rude front desk staff and the street noise.
[-0.9883480072021484] We spoke with the lady at the desk and all she had to say was "we have never had a Sunday like this... We have another valet employee coming in in an hour" Not helpful!
[-0.9854249954223633] Never in my life have I spent so much in one place and been treated so poorly.
[-0.8480129241943359] Hotel rooms and restaurant = great "Valet" = brutal and ruined the whole stay.
