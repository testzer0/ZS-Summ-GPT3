[0.956207275390625] First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business.
[0.9332733154296875] the hilton hotel downtown miami has the most amazing roof top pool and terrace.with stunning views over the port and miami.staff really helpful,and the rooms spacious clean and beds you just sink into.food and drink what you would expect to pay in city.pricey on overnight parking 28 dollars.but what a view of fireworks on new year.aesy to find and ideal if going on a cruise from miami port,only 5 mins drive.would recomend.
[0.901947021484375] For me, it's the little details that make a hotel worth the money, and the Hilton just doesn't have the attention to detail that a hotel of its caliber should.
[0.8878707885742188] My husband and friends stayed at the Hilton Miami Downtown for a week.We really enjoy this hotel.Our room was clean and comfortable.The pool is great if you enjoy swimming great drinks at the pool bar.Driveway staff was very friendley and polite.
[0.877716064453125] Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business.
