[-0.9972033500671387] When it was brought to their attention the front desk people were very rude about the problem and the maintence man tried telling us they were "sugar ants" We were promised several different things just so we would not report them to the health department or write a review.
[-0.9954547882080078] The breakfast is a joke of cold cereal and toast, no clock in room and staff is very unprofessional one of which was sleeping in back room and you had to bang on the side door to get him to come to the desk yawning and rubbing his eyes.

[0.8001480102539062] First off, the bathroom lights didn’t work, the carpet was filthy(soles of your feet will turn black..guaranteed) the AC unit didn’t work well, and to top that off, hotel is infested with cockroaches.
[0.7513504028320312] The pool was nice but there was a lack of sun loungers resulting in a queue at 9.00am when the pool opened to get one.
[0.7455253601074219] Very limited tv channels, but the room is only used for sleeping... you have to visit the Theme Parks when in Orlando.
[0.7429466247558594] Breakfast was VERY POOR, E Number ridden cereals, toast with limited jam and waffles (long wait) was about it - to top it all off there was no where near enough seating for everyone and we ended up eating standing up most days - would hate to stay here in high season.

[0.8482513427734375] The shuttle service was not good.
Parent: The shuttle service was also criticized by some guests.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8482513427734375] 3 times to this 2 star hotel,it meet my needs but metro shuttle service should be terminated,they were 1.5 hours late and desk could not get a hold of them.breakfast was not much but ok for on the run.my room next to office so had good internet.only paid about 30.00 per night so very low cost.pool was clean on this trip.close to shops and restraunts.so i will stay again .
[0.8039627075195312] It was very clean and our room was ok. the staff were very freindly and the only bad report that we have is with the shuttle busses.
[0.6474113464355469] The hotel provides scheduled shuttle service to and from the major theme parks but the schedule is the problem, it leaves you little time to enjoy the sights and you probably won't finish any theme park if you were to follow the shuttle's sked.
[0.5201416015625] THE GOOD....Fast Check-in,Close to Disney, Free pool towels, Clean, safe pool, Easy walking distance to restraunts, Free basic breakfast THE BAD....Air-con was loud and slow, paper thin walls, not enough cupboard space, poor decor, small bathroom, no porter, Unreliable and not enough park transfers, Bad smells in room.
[0.45867919921875] The shuttle was rarely late and if you want to go home a bit earlier from the parks, ask for a taxi from Animal Kingdom which will cost about 12 dollars.
