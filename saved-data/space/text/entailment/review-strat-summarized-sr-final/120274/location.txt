[0.726348876953125] I have read some bad reviews of this hotel and do not agree we stayed here in october this year and would go back every year it was clean and had everything we wanted on site the staff were always helpful and room was always clean early in the day so if we went back for lunch it was alrewady done the hotel is in the perfect spot near disney and good easy place to get to the malls and shops i didnt find one bad thing about this hotel it was perfect
[0.4801025390625] However the best bit of this hotel is by far the location, just 2 mile from Disney and surrounded by quality restaurants and shops, you can not go wrong.
[0.43487548828125] THE GOOD....Fast Check-in,Close to Disney, Free pool towels, Clean, safe pool, Easy walking distance to restraunts, Free basic breakfast THE BAD....Air-con was loud and slow, paper thin walls, not enough cupboard space, poor decor, small bathroom, no porter, Unreliable and not enough park transfers, Bad smells in room.
[0.313507080078125] I know this hotel is a great location and close to Disney but please....book one of the nicer hotels next door (The Best Western).

[0.9864802360534668] It was a good location, plenty of restaurants nearby and easy access to major routes The heated swimming pool was lovely with fresh towels piled high.
[0.97314453125] The hotel is actually in a good position on the 192 highway, really near to disney & close to lots of good places to eat - red lobster was the best it was just across the road.
[0.9692676067352295] The good...the place was close to the main entrance to Disney and lots of food choices nearby to eat.
[0.9546113014221191] Two double beds which were great because it was HOT so got a nice big bed to ourselves to keep cool (then a cuddle in the morning hehe) Good bathroom, good staff, good pool, TV with lots of channels and a free digital safe...... Good location on the 192 at the end so nice and quiet (with a mega short cut to animal kingdom if anyone wants to know it mail me) right near all the good buffet restaurants, close to disney and a short drive to universal.
[0.9534149169921875] The location couldn't be better and there are lots of restaurants around the hotel.

[-0.7621192932128906] Breakfast included but no place to sit.
[-0.60455322265625] Don't rely on the free breakfast, which consists of nothing more than toast, jam, sugar coated cereal and doughnuts, although the alternatives which we visited under duress in the fast food outlets in the surrounding areas are not too great an alternative.
[-0.46845245361328125] It is just a free service.
[-0.4668292999267578] What a nightmare!
[-0.4548072814941406] There was only coffee, juice, toast and cerial.

[0.131011962890625] The hotel is too close to a busy road.
Parent: However, some guests found the hotel to be too close to a busy road and were bothered by the constant pestering from the ticket stand to sell them a timeshare.

----- Supporting -----

[0.131011962890625] It is located on 192 which is close to everything which is nice but I would say to stay somewhere else, somewhere with basic amenities for the same budget price.
[0.051025390625] The MAJOR downside to this hotel, in fact, is that you have to make a u-turn slightly down the road to get to Disney....depending on traffic, THAT can be hazardous.
[0.0107421875] It's not the best location as you do need to drive everywhere but that was all part of the fun for us!!
[0.002666473388671875] There are plenty of other hotels down the same stretch in an equally good/better location so my advice is to chose them and not stay at the quality inn!
[0.0026636123657226562] No place to lounge.

[-0.9929015636444092] It was simple, great location.
[-0.9913671016693115] The parking lot was clean, the location of the hotel was GREAT (right next to many restaraunts, souvenier shops, and within 5 minutes to the Disnet World Parks).
[-0.9908711910247803] We booked with first choice and this seems to be there most budget hotel.............if you want better you'll have to pay for it i suppose, We wanted a cheap base to enjoy the local attractions but with that we also got a nice comfortable hotel room in a nice quiet area and everything was fineeeeeeeee.
