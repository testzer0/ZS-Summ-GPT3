[0.8957672119140625] Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip.
[0.8884429931640625] The hotel provides some wonderful views of the harbour and the rooms are modern and clean.
[0.692230224609375] The rooms are very clean, equipped with large flat screen TV and complimentary internet.
[0.6604595184326172] The rooms are clean and comfortable, the bathrooms very nice (love the shower!).
[0.6203403472900391] That aside, the rooms were very clean and provided all the amenities needed to help make our stay quite comfortable.

[-0.9831142425537109] The room also had a weird smell.
[-0.9821357727050781] Oh, and the sauna was broken.
[-0.9775733947753906] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[-0.9775409698486328] Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling.
[-0.9769802093505859] When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room.

[0.5758285522460938] The room was not clean enough.
Parent: A few reviewers mentioned that the room was not as clean as they would have liked, but this was not a common complaint.

[0.4854736328125] The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?).
[0.4027748107910156] No carpet on the floor, hardly any outlets and the bathroom was too small.
[0.27001953125] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[0.2646293640136719] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.

[0.7837600708007812] We needed to be able to provide some of our own food, so asked to have the mini bar emptied so we could use the fridge, and for a microwave, although it wasn't a regular part of the room.
[0.38222503662109375] No fuss about parking.
[0.184478759765625] It rained all four days that we were there in mid-July, which is fairly unusual for this time of year.
[0.14475250244140625] My feeling was that they would never make me feel as though any question I asked were silly.
[0.1411590576171875] This is a great hotel and obviously a favorite with discerning locals having events...they weren't really an obstruction to our having a great time, but did become something of a joke as both the hotel and adjoining park/marina/galleries are dripping with wedding parties.

[-0.7439346313476562] It's those kinds of perks which make people decide to return.
[-0.7171401977539062] With the hectic run up to Christmas ( I usually end up having to work right up to about 3 on the 24th), the arrival at the hotel is usually accompanied by a deep sigh... we're home!
[-0.630462646484375] There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading.
[-0.3935546875] I stay at other expensive hotels similar to this and they do this service, they also do not charge for the bikes if you are a guest of the hotel.
[-0.311309814453125] In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.
