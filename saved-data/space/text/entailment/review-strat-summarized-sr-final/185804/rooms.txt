[0.8302154541015625] I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking.
[0.758697509765625] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.

[0.4197998046875] The marble tile floors in the rooms make for easy management of the pet-friendly policy, so I don't mark this hotel down for that as some other reviewers have mentioned.
[0.23187255859375] I checked their website and discovered they allow pets, which explains the tile room in that room.
[0.1492156982421875] We could hear chairs and people moving around in the adjoining room as if it was in our room mostly because of the echoing from the marble floors.
[0.1419677734375] * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted.

[0.5155448913574219] Unfortunately they just don't have the level of service that would make them a great hotel.
[0.40175628662109375] * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible.
[0.3773956298828125] There actually isn't any; the bedside lamp is too dim to read by.

----- Supporting -----

[0.7208538055419922] The staff just seemed disinterested, especially at the bar and the front desk.
[0.4204254150390625] The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests.
[0.04598808288574219] Initially they were less than courteous about it but i said if there is a charge of course i would play however it might be helpful for future guests to be escorted to the bike and given a brief safety instruction prior to giving someone a key.
[0.037670135498046875] The service in the restaurant was a bit snobbish and I didn't get the condiments I requested the second morning, however this is minor in my opinion.

[0.9690337181091309] I love the location of this hotel!

[0.9651684761047363] I love the setting of this hotel.
[0.9540290832519531] The hotel itself was average plus, but as I mentioned the location nails it.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.4028167724609375] I booked an upgraded King room with a view and ended up beside the elevator in a room that looked pretty dated and uninviting.
[-0.399169921875] My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise.
[-0.38128662109375] If you're looking to stay at a big hi-rise in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown, then this place is not for you.
[-0.36785125732421875] I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult.
[-0.2819175720214844] Granville Island itself is very disappointing.
