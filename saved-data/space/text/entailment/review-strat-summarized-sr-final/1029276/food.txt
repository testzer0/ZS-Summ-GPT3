[0.8029708862304688] The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it.
[0.653594970703125] I also had great meals in the restuarant with good quality and service delivered by the staff.
[0.624603271484375] I also enjoyed the Lounge and food there.
[0.40673828125] The room was really clean, the hotel facilities were very good and the views from the room were amazing, we could not fault the service and the breakfast, everything was presented well.
[0.4029083251953125] Room service was great - they had great 24 hour food - try the conch chowder, the conch fritters, key lime pie - I could keep going, everything was delicious.

[-0.9683351516723633] There is no food or entertainment around.
[-0.961456298828125] There was one occasion in which we ordered from the menu, sadly it was a little disappointing because it was overcooked but we were taken care of almost immediately when we complained.
[-0.9592952728271484] After reading all the bad reviews I expected a real dump.
[-0.9542026519775391] I called often and continued to get unsatisfactory answers.
[-0.9535655975341797] Recommendation: eat elsewhere; even room service would probably have been better.

[0.9669427871704102] Rates were too expensive and service was terrible.
[0.8152694702148438] Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is.
[0.28188323974609375] I bit too much for the USA and the quality is mediocre at best.
[0.25174713134765625] Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs.
[0.24549102783203125] Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls.

[-0.9962310791015625] The restaurant inside the hotel had delicious plates and the breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and delicious.
[-0.9947800636291504] The executive lounge also had a nice view and offered hot and cold appetizers, water and soft drinks, along with wine and beer for a reasonable price.
[-0.9868941307067871] Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all.
[-0.984919548034668] We had a small group and received a decent price for the weekend.
[-0.9844872951507568] Had a great internet deal we found on hilton.com for the website, so we were able to stay there for under $65 a night.
