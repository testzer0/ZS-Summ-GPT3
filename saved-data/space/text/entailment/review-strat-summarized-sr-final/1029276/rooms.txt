[0.9564838409423828] This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace

[0.9799966812133789] Of course the downside was that the elevators were slow, depending on what time of the day it was ..but the way people complain on here, you would think it was the end of the world.
[0.9666461944580078] Because you will complain that the elevators are slow....that the elevators are warm....It will always be something and frankly you would complain if you were given the room for free.
[0.272369384765625] Really have never been through a slower check in - problem was that I was behind about 25 foreign tourists, which is what appears to make up the majority of this hotel's clientel.
[0.196319580078125] Due to on-site construction, elevator service was horrible.
[0.10321044921875] The elevator can take 20-30 minutes to get to your floor and is often filled with people and luggage.

[-0.9769554138183594] I was skeptical of the quality because of the great rates.
[-0.9675178527832031] We were near the lifts and they were noisy all night.
[-0.9279632568359375] The elevator dinged all night long keeping up the entire family.
