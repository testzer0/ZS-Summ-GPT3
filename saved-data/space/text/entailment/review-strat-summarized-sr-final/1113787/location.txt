[0.9608421325683594] Location wasn't the best and looked a little scary out on the street at times, but no issues while out walking before dark.
[0.5412139892578125] The area around the hotel isn't exactly swanky.
[0.38880157470703125] The view from the lower floors is kinda cruddy and the street noise might get loud on the weekend.
[0.3314361572265625] That evening we went down to the club PM which is in hotel very unfriendly and it took us for ever to get in and if your staying at hotel it is suppose to not be a problem to get in YEAH RIGHT!!!!
[0.307373046875] This extends to the restaurants as well Bad: â€¢ No parking within the hotel itself so if you do not wish to pay for valet parking you have to drive around to a nearby parking building â€¢ No upgrades for SPG Platinum members â€“ although since I was travelling for business, I didnâ€™t particularly care.

[-0.9869437217712402] The Joule has a modern feel kind of like the W but it is warmer feeling and more comforatble than the W.
