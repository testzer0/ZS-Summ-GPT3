Parent: The building is in need of refurbishment, according to some reviewers.

----- Supporting -----

[0.8947982788085938] The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room.

[0.82476806640625] The hotel is marvelous, their renovations are complete and they did a wonderful job, we had a room with king bed, great tv in the room and it was a very spacious room.
[0.804718017578125] We have stayed at this Marriott many times but this was our first time back since the renovation and it did not disapoint.

[-0.7866744995117188] Friday AM I had surgery.
[-0.6874847412109375] They arranged rental car service for us as well as airport transport.. All very reasonably priced and on time.
[-0.5963554382324219] I understand that for safety reasons the alarm was necessary, but did not understand why the annoucements continued every 5 minutes advising that they were looking into the matter and would provide further information later.
[-0.470916748046875] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.
[-0.4597816467285156] They announced on the PA system that there was no emergency but about an hour later, the same thing.

[0.62310791015625] This is a renovated Marriott with an above average lobby and room.
[0.5400848388671875] However, the rooms are very average (no safe, mini-bar for example).
[0.46071624755859375] The room was a standard hotel room, nothing special or unique.
[0.4451904296875] Great service, friendly staff, good food - pity the room wiater couldn't go further than the threshold !!!!

----- Weakening -----

[-0.995633602142334] We love the lobby with the huge centered fireplace (OK, no true fire, just gas but still very cozy and close to the bar) and the beds are one of the best we've ever slept in - huge, comfortable, good linen and very clean.
[-0.9935846328735352] The lobby was modern with a beautiful fireplace and a good breafast/coffee/drinks bar too.
[-0.993253231048584] In addition to being spacious, the lobby was decorated in a modern fashion with booth-like check-in desk, complete with a very professional and courteous staff who checked us in promptly.
[-0.9923849105834961] We loved the Eaton Centre Marriott - the lobby has a nice cocktail bar and good steak restaurant and with a modern art look.

[0.984339714050293] The rooms are spacious and beds very comfortable, unfortunately there was no bottled water in the room which was disappointing given the hotel standard but this is my only downside of the stay.
[0.9651527404785156] The rooms are large and the food in the dining room is decent enough.
[0.9486331939697266] Rooms were spacious and updated - flat screen tv, newer furniture.
[0.9463462829589844] The rooms were large and nicely appointed.

[-0.9920330047607422] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.

[0.9482364654541016] The decor was tasteful, flat-screen tv, VERY soft King bed, marble counter in the bathroom...we were quite impressed.

----- Weakening -----

[-0.9895553588867188] To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads.
[-0.9426097869873047] My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe.
[-0.9309234619140625] Not very convenient to go down to lobby all the time...Staff was not at all helpful in this matter... A sidenote: the room when we arrived was not vacumed and was not clean.
[-0.9191474914550781] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.

[0.9119834899902344] Everything was as expected, good check in, great location, nice room, good staff, etc....then about 11:00pm the fire alarms went off.
[0.7774505615234375] Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant!
[0.701141357421875] Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel!
[0.527618408203125] The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15.

[-0.9671354293823242] I was very impressed with this, and so we stayed, and so far, no problems.
[-0.9468994140625] Only downside was at 2am someone decided to light a cigarette in a stairwell and set off the smoke alarm causing all of the hotel guests to be evacuated.
[-0.9467029571533203] During the conference, the food/service department did a fantastic job with meals.
[-0.908447265625] Had some idiot pull fire alarm at 4 am on Sunday, but was resolved within 30 minutes and not having to evacuate.

[0.9662971496582031] I hesitate to start with a description of a not-so-good experience, but the staff response to the not-so-good experience was handled so well that in the end, I left the hotel quite impressed.

[0.9097342491149902] The hotel was nearly 100% full, but check-in went quickly and we felt like the staff was taking good care of us.
[0.886988639831543] The staff were courteous and helpful, and the sports bar on the first floor was a great place to hang out.

[-0.984771728515625] Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff.
[-0.9758005142211914] The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all".
[-0.9729442596435547] I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side.
[-0.9540023803710938] The front desk girl didn't seem to understand the situation and said "oh there is a shoppers 2 blocks from here."
