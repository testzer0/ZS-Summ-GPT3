[-0.9960479736328125] my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty.

[0.19871902465820312] Book-in online was quick and easy, check-in was a breeze and they even gave us a free upgrade to a bedroom suite to celebrate the occassion.
[0.147674560546875] Marriott also has uncompetitive internet access rates - because internet and phone are bundled together as a package.

[-0.9926395416259766] I was happy to get this hotel for $159/night - though internet was slow and added $16 dollars per day (though it included all calls - or so i thought until i got my bill and they had charged me $40 worth of long distance calls - they were promptly removed).
[-0.9881248474121094] i think this is a good value for the area except for the internet charges which were high for such a slow connection.
[-0.9641189575195312] I was on the 10th floor, it took forever for the shower to get hot and when it did the temperature fluctuated radically from luke warm to scalding.
[-0.9579572677612305] We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..
[-0.9321660995483398] They were slow to arrive at the lobby on Saturday afternoon, evening and the next morning.
