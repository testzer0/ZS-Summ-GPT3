[0.8254852294921875] The pool area is quite small, and elevators, lobby is packed by noon, and there seem to be a lot of kids running around everytime im there, and the giftshop and cafe were very overpriced.
[0.5623779296875] There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.
[0.5070343017578125] I can't comment on the food or drinks offered at the hotel as we did not order anything at the restaurant or room service - it was pretty expensive.

[0.17510986328125] And for this we paid fancy hotel restaurant prices - ugh!

[-0.9949421882629395] The restaurant was very good and reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant.
[-0.9879436492919922] Room service was not over-priced and it took about half an hour for our dinner to arrive on the Saturday evening, when we were too lazy to venture out for a meal.
[-0.9812259674072266] (1) Location of the hotel is ideal , my wife was thrilled as it was within short walling distance to the Eaton center one of the largest shopping centers in Toronto (2) Room is spacious compared to other 4 star hotels, good furniture, clean and neat (3) Good entertainment with LCD 37 inch TV with on demand movies and more (4) Staff are friendly and professional, good staffing numbers very adequate (5) Breakfast was great and included in the price of around US$ 200 per night , very fair price for this hotel, the breakfast included fresh fruits (Produce of Canada) and eggs and an egg station and many other delights
[-0.9812054634094238] There are tons of excellent restaurants close by for pretty much every taste and budget.
[-0.9682331085205078] Stayed from August 3rd to 5th with two friends for Caribana Weekend; booked on Expedia at the last minute so I was a bit worried, but the price was fair, so I figured I'd take what I got.

Parent: There were a few complaints about specific dishes, but overall people seemed to enjoy the food.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9048862457275391] I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea.
[0.7805461883544922] Food presentation was fancy, but the food didn't taste very good.
[0.5501384735107422] Concierge lounge nibbles in the evening were a little disappointing, but the staff were friendly (I think this area used to be the old steak house).

[0.3256721496582031] When my husband's Cesar salad was served with chicken instead of salmon, he had to hunt down the waiter to point out the problem, and the waiter barely seemed to care.

[-0.2571258544921875] The hotel staff may act like they don't know where it is... but it's on Queen St. For some reason, when we asked about it, they acted like they never heard of it - but it was packed, and they have awesome food!
