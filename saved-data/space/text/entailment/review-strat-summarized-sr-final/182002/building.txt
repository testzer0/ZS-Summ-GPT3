[-0.9814977645874023] My company recently booked a training session at the Primrose Hotel in Toronto.

[-0.9806613922119141] The only thing I might mention is the fact that the hotel seems to be located right in the midst of a very prominent gay section of Toronto, and for 7 straight males, some of whom are not particularly tolerant, this could potentially have been problematic.
[-0.9780101776123047] the concierge had little knowlege of the restaurants which should be a big part of his job but we made out ok. there are so many wonderful restaurants in toronto including a Korean Grill we went to where you bbq your own meat/fish.

[0.0664520263671875] When I complained about the elevators and wireless he just stood there with no apology or good explanation other than it would be too expensive to fix the elevators and it was all the guests' fault anyway for the elevator getting stuck since there were 8 people in the elevator (it's rated for 12 people).
