[0.823577880859375] The dining option was reasonable and the food (dinner & breakfast) was ok. Actually, dinner was of better quality than I was expecting since this wasn't a full service Hilton.
[0.260986328125] The buffet breakfast is really quite good and worth the price if you are hungry.
[0.189361572265625] The service was excellent, we were offered a deal on breakfast at check in.
[0.138702392578125] I particularly loved the breakfast they offer where we have a choice of a continental breakfast for $10 +tx or a buffet (all you can eat) for $15 +tx.
[0.12410736083984375] I have stayed at this Hilton Garden on Peter street on business many, many times-so when planning a weekend visit with the family I had no hesitation to book- Its well situated, clean and modern and generally a very good value and the Hhnonors perks are good- WOW what a difference during the weekend-instead of business folk and tourists-its packed with club kids and partyers-the staff do their best-but its noisy and the area around the hotel is pretty crazy late in the evening on weekends- I will stay again during the week-but never on a weekend

[-0.8012847900390625] We enjoyed a buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant on Sunday morning and then we called the valet parking to get our cars (two cars for the 8 of us).
