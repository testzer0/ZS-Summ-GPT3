[0.9759807586669922] Pros: room very clean and well-lit; staff extremely helpful; extra comfortable beds (probably one of the best hotel beds I've slept in) Cons: room internet was very slow except for very basic email checks; breakfast room was understaffed so that two frantic staff-members were running around looking very flustered and struggling to deal with all the guests
[0.6856193542480469] Say what you liked best & least - The best part in my opinion was the view of the CN Tower, but not every room will have that - other than that it would have to be the room size and beds.
[0.6412429809570312] Hotel rooms and restaurant = great "Valet" = brutal and ruined the whole stay.
[0.6199951171875] Some of the pros: 1.)

Parent: Overall, it seems that the hotel is generally clean, but there may be some areas that need improvement.

----- Supporting -----

[0.9024200439453125] All in all a great experience at the hotel...only thing they need to improve on is the wi-fi which really needs to be better than it was.
[0.420257568359375] Clearly they need more than two valet guys working on a Sunday morning when everyone is checking out for the weekend There was a party going on at 1-2AM beside one of our rooms.
[0.07696533203125] Everything about this hotel was great it's too bad something so negative like this is pretty much out of their control.
[0.07693862915039062] Our room was a decent size with a street view from the fifth floor although it would have been great to be higher up for better views.
[0.06996917724609375] The lobby is a little spare, and the furnishings are going down that Hilton Garden Inn direction of "your room is your office", which I appreciate when I travel for, well, business, and which appeals less for when I'm there because it's down the street from the theatre.
