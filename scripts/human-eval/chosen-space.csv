Uva , the cafe / bar downstairs made a cappuccino as good as any I had in Italy , and the best Americano my boyfriend has ever had .

It 's an old building that has been beautifully renovated but still suffers from persnickety heating , electrical and plumbing issues , as evidenced by the many workmen with whom we shared elevator rides and the apologetic explanation , on check - in , of how to work around the ( minor ) heat and lighting quirks of our room .
Our rooms also came with discount cards for the properties restaurants .",,,,
